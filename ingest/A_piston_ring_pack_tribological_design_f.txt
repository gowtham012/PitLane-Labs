ABSTRACT 
 
The design of piston ring pack is a major subject on the internal combustion engines. The current 
trend focused on thin piston rings and the improvements of profile to oil consumption and lubrication 
in each engine stage. In this paper, an investigation of piston ring shapes in modern combustion 
engines was performed. The geometrical dimensions of piston ring pack-cylinder tribo pair were 
obtained from a four stroke motor engine. A 2D axisymmetric model of ring pack-cylinder was 
created using the finite element method. The minimum oil thickness, the combustion gas pressures and 
the asperities contribution were updated for each crankshaft position in quasi static manner. The fluid 
field was solved based on the Navier Stokes approach, as well as the piston ring balance was 
performed. Several shape profiles for top ring were examined and compared. Lower curvature height 
improved the minimum lubricant thickness, thus the total friction force decreased near to top dead 
center.

1 Introduction  
The interaction of piston rings and cylinder inner liner has been numerical and experimental 
investigated by many researchers, in order to understand the main design issues, such as the friction 
losses, the oil consumption and the surface contact behavior. The analysis of piston assembly pack 
under boundary/mixed and hydrodynamic conditions is a key for re-design of engine components. 
Therefore, the contribution of the current paper is focused on piston ring shape and its behavior with 
the cylinder wall. 
One of the relative works which has to do with the piston ring profile and cylinder liner contact 
was made by Yeng [1]. Based on the Reynolds equation, the effects of piston ring curvature examined 
for two types of piston rings and the minimum oil thickness compared for each ring shape. 
Simultaneously, Dellis [2] examined the friction force with the use of a single ring test-rig taking into 
account the oil properties, the film thickness and the piston ring curvature. Results, for used and new 
piston rings presented and discussed.  Additionally, a numerical approach for a worn and new profile 
ring is developed by Chong et. al [3]. Regarding the geometry of ring profile the cavitation zone 
investigated and the minimum oil film illustrated.  
At the same time, simulation models of compression piston ring-cylinder system were presented by 
Zavos and Nikolakopoulos [4-6]. In our recent papers [4, 5], the mechanism of friction on a top 
smooth and wavy piston ring has been carried out in elasto-hydrodynamic conditions, utilized the 
Navier Stokes equations. The lubricant film velocity, the maximum oil thickness and the mechanical 
stresses on the piston ring were examined for several gas pressure leaks sub models [5]. Thereafter, the 
effect of lubricant oil on the friction in a real motor engine was investigated. The Strain gauge method 
was used for friction force measurement [6]. Afterwards, comparisons of experimental predicted and 
numerically calculated friction force was done and it was observed a good agreement. 
Agostino et. al [7] developed also a simulation model for the top ring-cylinder contact. In their 
work, the authors have sought to identify the piston ring friction losses due to the oil viscosity, the 
engine operating conditions and the ring surface treatments. Morris et. al [8] presented a numerical 
model for transient and thermal mixed lubrication conditions of first piston ring. Their study 
developed a novel control volume thermal mixing model, showing that the rise in the lubricant oil 
temperature through shear is much less than the liner temperature. Recently, a novel approach based 
on Navier Stokes equations including the Rayleigh-Plesset model investigated by the authors 
Shahmohamadi et. al [9, 10]. The effect of asperities in thin oil films proposed regarding the 
Greenwood-Tripp model. Finally, a cavitation zone along to piston ring liner is provided. 
The present paper presents a 2D axisymmetric piston ring pack model for a real four stroke motor 
engine located at the Machine Design Laboratory of the University of Patras. The model describes the 
gas pressures leakage for each ring taking into account the mathematical model by Chong et. al [3]. 
The fluid domain taking into account the ring balance into the piston groove is solved in a quasi static 
equilibrium analysis. The oil viscosity is considered as a function of cylinder’s liner temperature. 
Different profiles of top ring were examined and discussed. The evaluation of total friction force and 
minimum lubricant film for each shape is also studied around top dead center (TDC). 
  
2 Simulation Model  
The lubrication performance of piston ring pack is affected by the oil supply, which is related to the 
gas pressures, the asperities contact and the lubricant thickness. In this case, the basic dimensions of 
piston assembly system were measured from a four stroke motor engine 107 cc located at Machine 
Design Laboratory. The main specifications of four stroke motor engine illustrated in Table 1.

2.1 Gas Pressure Model of Piston-Piston ring pack  
This motor engine consists of two compression rings and one oil control ring. In practical terms, 
the first compression ring is operated under extreme conditions, and this is one more reason to 
improve its design and its lubrication performance. Figure 1 shows the type of piston rings of the 
motor engine and the variation of gas pressures. The main dimensions of piston-ring pack were 
measured by a 3D coordinate measuring machine. 
 
 
 
Figure 1: (a) Piston assembly geometry of four stroke motor engine, (b) the variation of gas pressures  
For this analysis, the combustion gas pressure of a four stroke motor engine is calculated by ref. 
[12]. Continuing, a sub model of gas pressure leakage between control volumes through the ring end-
gaps is developed and ilustrated in Figure 1. This method of gas flow have been developed 
analytically by Chong et. al [3]. Therefore, the prediction of each ring pressure is obtained according 
to the mathematical model of ref. [3]. It takes also into acount the mass flow rates { Q1, Q2, Q3 } 
between each ring clearance,and the gas flow is considered ideal.  
2.2 Temperature and Lubricant viscosity 
The temperature along the cylinder liner plays an essential role in lubricant’s oil performance. In 
this study, the motor engine is operated at a low rotational speed Ω = 1000 rpm cooled by an air-
condition at 18 oC. SAE 30 was used as lubricant and the temperature variation is illustrated using a 
high performance thermo camera type: FLIR SC660 with 640×480 resolution and ±1% accuracy. 
Figure 3 (a) shows a picture of liner temperature for Ω = 1000 rpm under warmed conditions. 
According to Morris work [8], the increment of oil temperature through shear is slighter than the liner 
temperature; hence the oil temperature is the same with the cylinder’s liner temperature at each 
position. Therefore, the oil temperature can be estimated using the measured temperatures in this 
analysis. As it is observed the temperature variation can be  considered as, TTDC = 43 oC , TBDC = 38 oC 
and Tmid =40 oC. The dynamic viscosity can be described as a function of oil temperature according to 
the Vogel’s equation (1) and it is presented in Figure 3 (b).

2.3 Modeling of Oil thickness 
The sensitivity of lubricant thickness is strong correlated with the piston ring shape and the 
operation engine conditions. In this study, the minimum oil film  hmin  is defined based on the piston 
ring balance criterion. In Figure 4 a sketch of the piston ring profile contact along to cylinder inner 
liner is illustrated.

where hmin(t) is the minimum oil thickness of piston ring-cylinder contact at any time, hs(y) is the 
piston ring face shape and δr , δcyl is the surface roughness amplitude for the ring and the cylinder 
accordingly. The local asperity elastic deformation is not considered in equation (2). Actually, the hard 
coating (Cr) around the ring thickness showed insignificant elastic deformation. 
 
3 Assumptions and Governing Equations 
 
A 2D axisymmetric piston ring pack model is created. The contact between the piston ring and 
cylinder liner is observed around the dead centers, under the consideration of mixed/hydrodynamic 
conditions. Afterwards, it is important to refer the following assumptions: 
 
1. The flow is considered laminar and two dimensional. 
2. Ring twist and flutter into the piston groove are ignored.

3. Body forces are considered and the piston – cylinder model is assumed to be concentric 
assembled. 
4. The oil viscosity is a function of liner temperature. 
5. The top piston ring moved in the axial direction according to the piston speed V in the y-
axis. 
 
A 2D axisymmetric model is developed using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The Navier 
Stokes equations, momentum equation (3), coupled with the continuity equation (4), are solved using 
the finite volume method.

3.1 Asperity contact model 
 
Asperities contact may substantially affect the piston ring performance when the oil film thickness 
is comparable with the roughness height. Thus, a part of the ring profile influenced by the asperities 
contact. In the present study, the Greenwood and Tripp model was studied for the asperities interaction 
between the ring and the cylinder. The asperity height distribution is Gaussian, since the average 
contact pressure pcont and the real area of contact Acont are given by the following equations:

4 Boundary conditions 
This model simulates the hydrodynamic force, the elastic ring tension and the asperity contact on 
piston ring pack-cylinder system. The radial motion of the piston rings was represented by the 
lubricant oil thickness. Therefore, the algorithm was updated in a quasi-static manner for each 
crankshaft position taking into account the piston linear speed, the minimum oil film, the gas pressures 
and the asperity load. The inlet and outlet pressures are pc and pout = patm , depending on the direction 
of piston movement. In equation (10) the back pressure pbk at the ring gap is equivalent to the 
combustion pressure. Figure 5 illustrates the applied forces on the top piston ring. Steel piston rings 
and aluminium cylinder considered in this analysis.

 and the pressure contact by the asperities pcont are calculated 
separately. Thereafter, the convergence criterion of the pressure balance was used according to the 
equation (10). If this criterion is not confirmed, then the minimum oil thickness hmin is redefined and 
the interaction loop of lubricant thickness (11) is repeated. The value of ε=0.03 is given in the 
numerical parameter ε (equation 11) in order to perform  simulations here.

4.1 Fluid Algorithm Implementation and Meshing 
 
Figure 6 illustrates the steps of simulation solution and the computational grids of fluid domain. 
Regarding the fluid field, tetrahedral elements are used. According to the relevant published works [5, 
6], ten divisions were used in the radial direction and 500 divisions were used in the axial direction. It 
should be noted that this configuration of fluid meshing shown a very good conformance with the 
results of Shahmohamadi et. al [10]. Continuing, the convergence criteria were activated relative to the 
pressure error [4-6] and the ring balance convergence criterion is also used as it is discussed in 
paragraph 4.

4.2 Total Friction Force 
 
The total friction force is obtained as a sum of the viscous friction because of the oil film interface 
and the boundary friction due to asperity interactions along to piston ring profile. The contribution of 
mixed/hydrodynamic regime on the piston ring-cylinder contact has been shown by the analytical 
expression (12). It is important to refer that the non-Newtonian Eyring shear stress το and the boundary 
shear strength of the surfaces, named ς, have been taken from refs. [8, 10].

5 Results and Discussion 
5.1 Fluid Modeling Validation  
The pressure distribution along to piston ring thickness compared with the numerical data of 
Shahmohamadi et. al [10]. As follows from Figure 7, the predicted pressure field by the current has a 
very good agreement (Presserror ≤ 5%) with those of ref [10]. In more detail, these validated results 
were obtained for a barrel piston ring at crank angle (φ = -5o) when the piston moves upwards and the 
balance confirmed for minimum oil thickness hmin = 0.39 μm as obtained from the equation (11). 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Validation results from Shahmohamadi et. al [10]. 
5.2 Effect of the Piston ring Curvature  
Figure 8 illustrates the pressure profile of first compression ring at different curvatures. The top 
ring behaviour is simulated at reversal point (TDC), where the boundary/mixed lubrication occur. As 
observed the pressure and the oil distribution change by varying the ring profile curvature. For 
example, the maximum pressure is increased substantially 26.7% when the curvature becomes higher 
from C = 3 μm, Yoff = 0 to C = 20 μm, Yoff = 0. Also, it is clear that the “flatter” profile increases the 
minimum oil film thickness; hence the total friction force is reduced. As indicated in Table 3, the top 
ring with the curvature of C = 3 μm, has a minimum value regarding the boundary friction. The 
minimum lubricant thickness is increased in a value of hmin = 0.68 μm, in comparison with the ring’s 
curvature of C = 20 μm. Hence, a higher curvature height leads to a thinner oil film near the TDC; 
since the boundary lubrication is enhanced.

6 Conclusions 
In the current paper a 2D axisymmetric model of piston-ring pack from a real four stroke motor 
engine is developed. Lower curvature height leads to a higher film thickness at the top dead center 
(TDC). In fact, the carrying load capacity of the ring profile changes the oil film distribution near to 
the reversal points. To this point, “flatter” ring shape tends to an “optimum” minimum lubricant 
thickness giving zero friction force in boundary lubrication regime.
