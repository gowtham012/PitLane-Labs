Abstract 
Exhaust manifold is one of the important components of internal combustion engine which plays a major role in the 
improvement of fuel consumption of the engine.  Combustion efficiency of the engine can be improved by improving the 
exhaust manifold design in internal combustion engine. Performance of the engine increases if the exhaust manifold is of a 
good condition. The designing of exhaust manifold is a complex procedure and is dependent on many parameters. Better the 
exhaust manifold design better is performance of the engine. The major work is to improve the design to lower the 
backpressure in the exhaust manifold which increases the performance of the engine.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is 
one of the most popular and current running software which is mostly used in automobile industries in order to reduce the 
cost which is spent in design and analysis of various models in the fluid flow field. In the present work, analysis is carried out 
for different shape of exhaust manifolds using CFD software.To achieve the optimal geometry for the low backpressure and 
high exhaust velocity, five different models were designed and comprehensively analyzed with the help of velocity contours 
and pressure contours. Using the commercially available software the flow through exhaust manifold is done. Comparison is 
done for five different models using the velocity contour and pressure contour and best possible model for lower backpressure 
and high exhaust velocity is suggested. 
Key Words: Multi-Cylinder Engine, Exhaust Manifold, Back Pressure, Exhaust Velocity.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In an IC engine, one of the most important component is 
the exhaust manifold. Exhaust manifold designing is a 
complicated procedure as the designing depends on 
many parameters viz. exhausts velocity, backpressure, 
mechanical efficiency etc. The significance of any of these 
parameters depends upon the designer’s needs. Usually 
backpressure, exit exhaust velocity, power requirement 
are the some thoughts of the exhaust manifold design. 
Exhaust manifold is made up of cast iron or stainless 
steel .It collect gases from different cylinders and supply 
to the exhaust manifold. Many research and lots of 
studies have been done in this field. The liquid cooled 
exhaust manifold using CFD is done by the sir Scheeringa 
et al. The purpose of the study is to understand the 
manifold operation and flow property distribution and 
heat transfer detailed information.The replication of 
actual condition in model due to involvement of such a 
huge number of factors is almost impossible. In an 
exhaust manifold of any multicylinder engine the output 
gases are collected from more than two cylinders into a 
single pipe. The inlet of the multicylinder exhaust 
manifold is connected to the outlet of the multicylinder 
heads. Exhaust manifold is attached to the engine and 
major part where the stream from different cylinders is 
to be collected into a one pipe in multicylinder engines. 
The collected hot exhaust gases come out from the single 
outlet of the exhaust manifold from the header of the 
cylinder.The backpressure of the exhaust manifold at the 
outlet should be less in order to have a optimum 
performance of the engine. Higher the backpressure 
lower is the performance or economy for domestic 
vehicles. Higher backpressure is required for the race 
cars to achieve the higher speed in shorter time. The 
exhaust gases should have high velocity at the outlet of 
the exhaust manifold to have a good mechanical 
efficiency and thermal efficiency.

Backpressure is one of the common problem 
associated with the exhaust manifold. The literature 
review reveals that the lots of work have been done for 
the improvement of the exhaust manifold in order to 
improve the working of the engine. CFD method reduces 
the cost of manufacturing and production time. 
Literature review shows that lots of exhaust manifold 
study have been done using the CFD technique. Some of 
the literature review are as follows.  
PL. S. Muthaiah [1], He has analyzed the exhaust 
manifold in order to reduce the backpressure and also to 
increase the particulate matter filtration. He has 
modified the different exhaust manifold by varying the 
size of the conical area of the exhaust manifold and 
varying the size of the grid wire mesh packed throughout 
the exhaust manifold. When size of the grid mesh packed 
decreased the backpressure increases which leads to 
lower the performance of the engine due to more fuel 
consumption and hence low volumetric efficiency. When 
size of the grid mesh packed increased the backpressure 
decreases the filtration of the particulate matter also 
reduces which will not satisfy the standards of the 
pollution control. Computational fluid dynamics is used 
for the study of the exhaust manifold and best possible 
design 
of 
the 
exhaust 
manifold 
with 
minimum 
backpressure and maximum particulate matter filtration 
efficiency is suggested. 
K.S. Umesh, V.K. Pravin and K. Rajagopal [2] In this work 
eight different models of  exhaust manifold were 
designed and analyzed to improve the fuel efficiency by 
lowering the backpressure and also by changing the 
position of the outlet of the exhaust manifold and 
varying the bend length. The eight different modified 
models are short bend centre exit (SBCE), short bend 
side exit (SBSE), long bend centre exit (LBCE), long bend 
side exit (LBSE), short bend centre exit with reducer (  
SBCER), short bend side exit with reducer (SBSER), long 
bend centre exit with reducer (LBCER), long bend side 
exit with reducer(LBSER).After analysis they included 
that the exhaust manifold with long bend centre exit 
with reducer (LBCER), gives the highest overall 
performance.    
Kulal et al.(2013) [3]work comprehensively analyzes 
eight different models of exhaust manifold and 
concluded the best possible design for least fuel 
consumption. CFD is the current trend on automotive 
field in reducing the cost effect for analysis of various 
models on the basis of fluid flow. A multi-cylinder Maruti 
- Suzuki Wagon-R engine with maximum speed of 1500 
rpm is taken for the analysis. The load and performance 
test is conducted. From the experiment backpressure 
and exhaust temperatures are measured. The mass flow 
rate and velocities are calculated. Flow through the 
exhaust manifold is analyzed using commercially 
available software with mass flow rate and pressure as 
boundary conditions. 
Vivekananda Navadagi and SiddaveerSangamad [4]they 
analyzed the flow of exhaust gas from two different 
modified 
exhaust 
manifold 
with 
the 
help 
of 
Computational fluid dynamics. To achieve the optimal 
geometry for the low backpressure they have analyzed 
two different exhaust manifold, base geometry exhaust 
manifold and the modified geometry exhaust manifold. 
In the base model of the exhaust manifold the outlet is at 
side of the first inlet where as in the modified model of 
the exhaust manifold the outlet is at the centre of the 
exhaust manifold. Analysis has been done for the two 
different exhaust manifolds. The results were compared 
for the two models and it is found that the modified 
model gives low backpressure in comparison with other 
base model which ensures the improvement in the 
efficiency of the engine.

From the fig. 14 it is evident that due to the convergent 
shape of the inlet, velocities are found to be lower at the 
connecting area and outlet. The low velocity results in 
high backpressure. It is observed that exhaust velocities 
are considerably decreases by designing the manifold 
using the convergent inlet. Low turbulence kinetic 
energy is observed throughout the flow is shown the fig

4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this work, different exhaust manifolds are analyzed 
with the help of commercial CAE software and flow of 
exhaust is observed and velocity and pressure 
distribution along the length of exhaust manifold is 
obtained through simulation. Five different models 
designed and results were analyzed through CFD Post 
processing. The use of different shapes of exhaust 
manifold helps in easy flow of exhaust. 
 
 Model 5 facilitates easy flow of exhaust without 
recirculation and low backpressure at the 
exhaust outlet in comparisons with all other 
models.  
 
 Turbulence kinetic energy is almost zero in the 
model 5 and hence the exhaust flows easily.  
 
 Velocity at the outlet of model 5 is more and 
hence the backpressure reduces considerably. 
 
 The optimum design for a exhaust manifold is 
Model 5 with 0.845 bar back pressure and outlet 
velocity 12.5m/s. 
 
 The minimum backpressure and higher exhaust 
velocities are achieved by using exhaust 
manifolds with reducers, thus also reducing 
emissions.
