INTRODUCTION: 
Before studying the actual crankshaft and design details, we shall study briefly the basics 
of Power Transmission of shafts. 
 
6.1 Power Transmitting Shaft: 
Shaft Design consists primarily of the determination of the correct shaft diameter to 
ensure satisfactory strength and rigidity when the shaft is transmitting power under 
various operating and loading conditions. Shafts are usually circular in cross section, and 
may be either hollow or solid. 
Design of shafts of ductile materials, based on strength, is controlled by the maximum 
shear theory.  And the shafts of brittle material would be designed on the basis of the 
maximum normal stress theory.  
Various loads subjected on Shafting are torsion, bending and axial loads.

6.2. Crank Shaft: 
A crankshaft is used to convert reciprocating motion of the piston into rotary motion or 
vice versa. The crankshaft consists of the shaft parts, which revolve in the main bearings, 
the crank pins to which the big ends of the connecting rod are connected, the crank arms 
or webs, which connect the crankpins, and the shaft parts. The crankshaft, depending 
upon the position of crank, may be divided into the following two types. 
The crankshaft is the principal member of the crank train or crank assembly, which latter 
converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons into rotary motion.  It is subjected to both 
torsional and bending stresses, and in modern high-speed, multi-cylinder engines these 
stresses may be greatly increased by resonance, which not only renders the engine noisy, 
but also may fracture the shaft.  In addition, the crankshaft has both supporting bearings 
(or main bearings) and crankpin bearings, and all of its bearing surfaces must be 
sufficiently large so that the unit bearing load cannot become excessive even under the 
most unfavorable conditions.  At high speeds the bearing loads are due in large part to 
dynamic forces-inertia and centrifugal.  Fortunately, loads on main bearings due to 
centrifugal force can be reduced, and even completely eliminated, by the provision of 
suitable counterweights.  All dynamic forces increase as the square of the speed of 
rotation. (i.e. FDynamic↑⇒Speed2↑) 
 
6.2.1 TYPES OF CRANKSHAFT 
A crankshaft is composed of the crankpins, crank arms, crank journals, and driving ends. 
As a rule, crankshafts are forged in a single piece, but occasionally they are built up. 
Built-up crankshafts are used in small single- and double-cylinder motorcycle engines. 
The enclosed flywheels of these engines take the place of the crank arms, the crankpin 
and crank journals being bolted to the flywheels, which latter are cast with solid webs. 
The built-up construction also has advantages when it is desired to support the crankshaft 
in three or more ball bearings, as with a one-piece shaft all intermediate bearings would 
have to be stripped over the crank arms, and therefore would have to be made extraor-
dinarily large. 
A crankpin together with the two crank arms on opposite sides of it is frequently referred 
to as a "throw." In some crankshafts there is only a single throw between a pair of main 
journals or supporting bearings, while in others there are two and even three or four 
throws between main bearings.

The other classification is based on the number of cranks in the shaft are:

II. Multi throw crankshafts 
A crankshaft with only one side crank or centre crank is called a single throw crankshaft. 
A crankshaft with two-side cranks, one on each end or more centre cranks is called as 
multi throw crankshaft.

6.2.3 Materials 
For the proper functioning, the crankshaft should full fill the following conditions: 
1. Enough strength to withstand the forces to which it is subjected i.e. the bending 
and twisting moments. 
2. Enough rigidity to keep the distortion a minimum. 
3. Stiffness to minimize, and strength to resist, the stresses due to torsional 
vibrations of the shaft. 
4.  Sufficient mass properly distributed to see that it does not vibrate critically at the 
speeds at which it is operated. 
5. Sufficient projected areas of crankpins and journals to keep down the bearing 
pressure to a value dependent on the lubrication available. 
6.  Minimum weight, especially in aero engines.

The crankshafts are made much heavier and stronger than necessary from the strength 
point of view so as to meet the requirements of rigidity and vibrations. Therefore the 
weight cannot be reduced appreciably by using a material with a very high strength. The 
material to be selected will also depend upon the method of manufacture i.e. cast, forged, 
or built up. Built up crank shafts are sometimes used in aero engines where light weight 
is very important. 
 In industrial engines, 0.35 Carbon steel of ultimate tensile strength 500MPa to 525 MPa 
and 0.45 Carbon steel of ultimate tensile strength of about 627 to 780 MPa are commonly 
used. 
In transport engines, alloy steel e.g. manganese steel having ultimate tensile strength of 
about 784 to 940 MPa is generally used. 
In aero engines, nickel chromium steel having ultimate tensile of about 940 to 1100 MPa 
is generally used. Heavy duty Cast iron is being successfully used for crankshafts, 
especially for industrial engines of comparatively low speed and it can replace easily the 
plain carbon steels. Cast iron usually used for crankshafts is nickel cast iron with ultimate 
tensile strength ranging from 350 to 525 MPa. Cast steel is also used as material for 
crankshafts, its ultimate tensile strength ranging from 560 to 600 MPa. 
Students are requested to go through the Table3.2/47, Table3.3/48, Table 3.5b/48, and 
page no 412 to 430 of the data handbook for different material properties. 
 
Medium-carbon steel is the material most extensively used. The blanks from which the 
crankshafts are machined are produced by the drop forging process. This process requires 
several heatings to a good red heat, which impairs the physical qualities of the steel; and 
the latter have to be restored and the latter have to be restored by suitable heat treatment, 
consisting of normalizing, reheating and quenching. The carbon steel generally used for 
crankshafts is S.A.E. steel No. 1045 [Refer T 1.18/428] which has the following 
composition and physical properties:

A suitable heat treatment for drop forgings of this grade of steel is as follows: Normalize 
at 5710C to 9270C, reheat to 7890C to 8430C, quench in oil and draw at 8420C. When thus

In some of the higher-grade automotive engines, chrome-nickel steel (S.A.E. 3140) is 
used for the crankshaft. The composition and the approximate mechanical properties of

The heat treatment for this steel consists in normalizing at 8710C -9270C, annealing to the 
desired structure or machinability; heating to 7880C - 8160C, quenching in oil, and 
tempering at 4830C 
Other materials used for crankshafts include chrome-vanadium and chrome-molybdenum 
steels. All of these binary alloy steels have excellent mechanical properties, the tensile 
strength in the heat-treated condition usually running above 1034MPa 
 
6.2.4 Manufacturing: 
Great care must be observed in the manufacture of crankshafts since it is the most 
important part of the engine. Small crankshafts are drop forged. Larger shafts are forged 
and machined to shape. Casting of the crankshafts allows a theoretically desirable but 
complicated shape with a minimum amount of machining and at the smallest cost. These 
are cast in permanent moulds for maximum accuracy and a minimum of machining. 
While machining, the shaft must be properly supported between centers and special 
precautions should be taken to avoid springing. The journals and crankpins are ground to 
exact size after turning. After this, the crankshaft is balanced. Large shafts of low speed 
engines are balanced statically; Crankshafts of high-speed engines are balanced 
dynamically on special balancing machines. Most crankshafts are ground at the journals 
and crankpins. In some cases grounding is followed by hand lapping with emery cloth.   
 
6.2.6. Bearing pressures:  
The bearing pressures are very important in the design of crankshafts. The allowable 
bearing pressure depends upon the journal velocity, change of direction of   bearing

Engineering and technology, HUBLI-31; Session

11
pressures, amount and method of lubrication and the maximum gas pressures and space 
limitations. Maximum allowable bearing pressures are given below Table 1. 
 
6.2.6.Stresses:  
The stresses induced in the crankshafts are bending and also shear stresses due to 
torsional moment of the shaft. Most crankshafts fail due to progressive fracture due to 
repeated bending or reversed torsional stresses. Thus the type of loading on the 
crankshafts is fatigue loading therefore, the design should be based on endurance limit.  
To avoid stress concentration and fatigue failure, abrupt changes in the section of shaft 
connection should be avoided. Two different cross sections must be blended with a large 
fillet ‘r’, if possible, r should not be less than 0.2d. [d is the diameter of the shaft].  If 
there is no space for fillet, the crank web should be under cut to obtain the fillet. This will 
make the web weak and to compensate for it, the width is increased. (Figure12) 
 
Since the failure of the crankshaft is serious for the engine, and also because of the 
inaccuracy in determining all the forces and stresses, a high factor of safety based on 
endurance limit from 3 to 4 should be used. To be on the safe side, the endurance limits 
for complete reversal of bending and torsional stresses are taken. 
For chrome nickel and other alloy steels, the endurance limit is about 525 N/mm2 in 
bending and about 290 N/mm2 in shear.

For carbon steel and cast steel, the endurance limit is about 220 N/mm2 in bending and 
about 120 N/mm2  in shear. For alloy cast iron, the endurance limit is about 140 N/mm2 in 
bending and in shear.  
 
 Thus the allowable stress is: 
 For Carbon steel:  bending = 55 to 75 N/mm2  
                                          Shear   = 30 to 40 N/mm2  
 Combined stress = 2
1  (elastic limit in tension) 
 
For alloy Cast Iron:

6.2.7 Balance Weights:
In a single-cylinder crankshaft the centrifugal force on the crank arms, crankpin, and part 
of the connecting rod forms an unbalanced rotating force, which would cause the engine 
to vibrate if no means were provided to balance it. Therefore, balance weights are applied 
to the crank arms.  
In a high-speed engine the balance weights are preferably forged integral with the crank 
arms. If made separate, they must be very securely applied, since the stresses on the 
fastenings due to the centrifugal force at "racing" speeds are very considerable, and if one 
of the weights should come loose, it would be sure to do serious damage. Alloy steel 
bolts or studs should be used, or the counterweights should be fitted to the crank arms in

such a way that the centrifugal force produces shearing stresses in the parts, instead of 
tensile stresses in the bolts. 
In a double-cylinder opposed engine the crankshaft is always made with two throws set at 
1800 relative to each other. One set of reciprocating parts then always moves in 
opposition to the other set, and at exactly the same speed, so that the reciprocating parts 
are perfectly balanced, except for the fact that the two sets are not quite in line with each 
other. The rotating parts also are very nearly balanced, since the centrifugal force acting 
on one throw is equal and opposite in direction to the centrifugal force acting on the other 
throw, and there is only a small rotating couple due to the centrifugal forces acting at the 
ends of an arm equal in length to the distance between the centers of the two. This 
rotating couple can be balanced by applying balance weights to the two short crank arms. 
 
In a four-cylinder vertical engine the four throws are always in the same plane, the two 
outer throws being on the same side of the crankshaft axis, and the two inner throws on 
the opposite side. The centrifugal force acting on each throw is a radial rotating force, 
which may be considered to act at the center of that throw. The centrifugal forces F on 
the two outer throws (Figure 13) naturally are always in the same plane, and. as they are 
equal, their resultant R is a force equal to twice that acting on the individual throw, acting 
at a point midway between the two throws. The resultant Rl of the centrifugal forces F1 
acting on the two inner throws is exactly equal to the resultant of the centrifugal forces 
acting on the two outer throws, and acts at the same point but in the opposite direction to 
the latter; consequently it neutralizes or balances it.

6.2.8  Local Balance: 
But while a crankshaft of this type is perfectly balanced as a whole, its individual throws 
are unbalanced, and since the crankshaft is more or less flexible, the centrifugal force 
acting on the individual throw presses the crank journals adjacent to it against their 
bearings, adding to the loads on these bearings. 
To reduce this bearing load it is now customary to provide crank arms of high-speed 
engines with balance weights. A rather serious degree of local unbalance occurs in a four-
cylinder, two-bearing crankshaft, because in the conventional design there is nothing to 
balance the two inner crank pins and the intervening portion of the crankshaft. Sometimes

balance weights are welded to crankshafts of this type, as well as to others, but the 
majority of all crankshafts for high-speed engines have balance weights forged on all 
crank arms that are not symmetrical with relation to the crankshaft axis, which balance 
weights either completely or partly balance the rotating parts of the crank throw. A 
crankshaft of such design that the centrifugal forces acting on it would vanish if all acted 
in the same plane perpendicular to the crankshaft axis is said to be in static balance. 
In a six-throw crankshaft the throws are arranged in pairs, the two inner ones being in 
line with each other, as are also the two outer ones and the two intermediate ones, 
respectively. Each pair of throws is located at an angular distance of 1200 from the other 
two pairs. By reference to Figure 14, which is an end view of a six throw, seven-bearing 
crankshaft, it can be seen that if all of the throws are identical, such a crankshaft is in 
static balance. The resultant F of the centrifugal forces on the two throws of each pair 
acts at the middle of the length of the crankshaft. The three resultants therefore all act in 
the same plane radially outward from the center of the crankshaft, at angles of 1200, and 
they exactly balance each other. The highest degree of balance, of course, is obtained if 
each throw is balanced separately, which involves the use of a balance weight on each 
arm.  
Six-cylinder crankshafts with either three or four main bearings are not inherently 
balanced. In fact, as sometimes made, they are not even in static balance. In the most 
primitive form, the long crank arms extend straight across from one crankpin to another 
at angular distance of 1200 therefrom. This crank arm then lies wholly to one side of the 
axis of rotation, and in operation produces an unbalanced rotating force whose direction 
is at all times along a line through the axis of rotation and the center of gravity of the 
crank arm. The magnitude of this unbalanced force is proportional to the distance of the 
center of gravity of the crank arm from the axis of rotation, and therefore can be reduced 
by reducing this distance, by curving the crank arm inward, as shown in Figure 15. The 
rotating force, of course, can be entirely eliminated by bolting a balance weight against 
the side of the long crank arm.

6.2.9 Empirical Rules for Crankshaft Dimensions 
In making a preliminary lay-out, all dimensions of the crankshaft can be made 
proportional to the cylinder bore. Of course, the proportion between any given dimension 
of the crankshaft and the cylinder bore varies with the number and arrangement of 
cylinders and with the type of crankshaft as defined by the number of its main bearings. 
In all drop forged crankshafts in which the arms are left unfinished, the arm section, of 
course, is not a rectangle, as draft has to be allowed on the two long sides, usually about 
70. In applying the rules for arm thickness the calculated thickness can be taken as the 
mean between the minimum and maximum actual thicknesses. 
 
6.2.10 Six Cylinder Crankshafts 
  
Crankshafts for six-cylinder in line engines are made with three, four, or seven main 
journals. The greater the number of main journals the better the support for the crankshaft 
and the smoother the operation of the engine at high speeds. On the other hand, 
manufacturing costs increase somewhat with the number of main bearings. Whatever the 
number of main journals, the angular spacing of the throws is the same; that is, throws 
Nos. 1 and 6 are in line, as are throws Nos. 2 and 5, and throws Nos. 3 and 4. [Firing 
order 1-6-2-5-3-4]  Both the three-bearing and the four-bearing crankshafts have short 
arms connecting a crankpin with the adjacent main journal, and long arms connecting two 
crankpins spaced 120° apart. In Figure 16 is shown sides view of the rear half of a four-
bearing, six-cylinder crankshaft (the front half being omitted because it is an inverse 
duplicate of the rear). At the center between crankpins Nos. 3 and 4 there is a balance 
weight, of which a transverse section is shown. The short crank arms have the usual 
integral counterweights, while the long crank arm is in the form of a disc, of which a side 
view is shown at the right in the illustration. Back of the junction with the crankpins the 
disc is rounded off so as to eliminate unnecessary weight. Long crank arms of the same 
general form are used in three-bearing crankshafts for six-cylinder engines, which latter

have four of them. Seven bearing, six-cylinder crankshafts usually are finished all over; 
at least the crank arms, which are all similar in shape, are finished on both sides, so as to 
make the engine as compact as possible length wise.

6.2.11 Eight Cylinder Crankshafts 
Crankshafts for eight-cylinder in line engines are designed with either five or nine main 
journals. In the first case there are two crank throws between supports, while in the last 
there is only one. Here, too, the angular spacing of the various throws is the same, 
regardless of the number of main journals, cranks Nos. 1 and 8 being in line, also Nos. 2 
and 7, 3 and 6, and 4 and 5, and the angular spacing between one pair of cranks and the 
next is always 90°. The crankshaft of an eight-cylinder in-line engine consists essentially 
of two conventional four-cylinder crank shafts, one of these being cut in halves, and each 
half joined to one end of the other crankshaft, in a plane at right angles to it. Figure is a 
side view of such a crankshaft. The center bearing is made considerably longer than the 
two intermediate bearings, be cause it carries the inertia loads from two sets of 
reciprocating parts that are in phase, while in the case of the intermediate bearings the 
two sets of reciprocating parts on opposite sides of them are 90° out of phase.

6.2.12 Oil Holes Drilled in Crankshafts 
 
In engines provided with pressure lubrication, oil holes are drilled through the crankshaft 
journals and arms to permit oil to flow from the main to the crankpin bearings. 
Sometimes radial holes are drilled through the crank arms, and communicating axial and 
radial holes through the journals, the holes through the crank arms and the axial holes 
through the journals later having their ends plugged. However, the preferred practice is to 
drill single inclined holes through the main journals, crank arms and crankpins, as

illustrated in Figure 18. In the illustration, a second hole is shown drilled halfway through 
main journal, so that there are two oilcrankshaft inlets, but this practice is not common.

6.2.13 Balancing Crankshaft 
Crankshafts, after they are completely machined, must be balanced both statically and 
dynamically. A crankshaft is in static balance if, when placed on horizontal steel balance 
ways or their equivalent, it will remain in any position to which it is turned. A simple 
static balancing machine consists of two pairs of discs freely supported either on 
hardened centers or on ball bearings (Figure 19), the two pairs being sufficiently far apart 
so the crankshaft can be placed upon them with its end main bearings. If the center of 
gravity of the crankshaft does not lie in the mechanical axis, then the crankshaft will turn 
until the center of gravity is directly underneath the mechanical axis. By removing 
material from the heavy side, with a drill or emery wheel, until the crankshaft will remain 
in any angular position in which it is placed on the discs, static balance may be attained. 
 
Dynamically the shaft may still be unbalanced. For instance, there may be excess weight 
on one side of the shaft at one end, which is balanced statically by an equivalent weight 
on the other side at the opposite end.  In that case, when the engine is running, there is 
what is known as a centrifugal couple, and this must be eliminated before the crank can 
be expected to run without vibration at high speeds. Unbalance of this kind can be 
determined only in a dynamic balancing machine.

6.3 Design Procedure: 
1. Determine the magnitudes of the various loads acting on the crankshaft. 
2. Determine the distance between supports. The distances will depend upon the 
lengths of the bearing. The lengths & diameters of the bearings are determined on 
the basis of maximum permissible bearing pressures, l/d ratios and the acting 
loads. (TABLE 1 and Table 3.6/49) 
3. For the sake of simplicity and safety, the shaft is considered to be supported at the 
centers of the bearings. 
4. The thickness of the crank webs is assumed, about 0.5d to 0.6d, where d is the 
shaft diameter, or from 0.22D to 0.32D, where D is the cylinder bore. 
5. Now calculate the distance between supports. 
6. Assume allowable bending and shearing stresses. 
7. Compute the necessary dimensions of the crankshaft. 
 
The above procedure is general design procedure.  It may change as per the requirements 
and definition of the given problem.  
Note: All the forces and reactions are assumed to be acting at the centers of the bearings. 
 
6.3.1 DESIGN CALCULATIONS: 
In the design of the crankshafts, it is assumed that the crankshaft is a beam with two or 
more supports. Every crankshaft must be designed or checked at least for two crank 
positions, one when the bending moment is maximum, and the other when the twisting 
moment is a maximum. In addition, the additional moments due to the flywheel weight, 
belt tension and other forces must be considered. 
To make the calculations simpler, without loosing accuracy, it is assumed that the effect 
of the bending forces does not extend two bearings between which a force is applied. 
There are two considerations, which determine the necessary dimensions of the crankpin. 
One is that its projected bearing area (diameter times length) must be large enough so it 
will safely sustain the bearing loads imposed upon it by gas pressure, inertia and 
centrifugal force; the second, that the crankshaft as a whole must be sufficiently rigid so 
that it will not vibrate perceptibly under the periodic forces to which it is subjected in 
service. When the crankshaft of a given engine is made more rigid, the so-called critical 
speeds-that is, speeds at which there is synchronous vibration-are raised, and in this way 
at least the most important critical speeds can be moved outside the normal operating 
range.

6.4  Analysis of Center Crank Shaft: 
The crank shaft is to analysed for two positions:    
i) Crank on Dead Center:  and ii) Crank at angle of maximum Twisting Moment 
6.4a  Crank at Dead Center 
When the crank is on dead center, maximum bending moment will act in the crankshaft. 
The thrust in the connecting rod will be equal to the piston gas load (F), W is the weight 
of the flywheel acting downward and T1 and T2 is the belt pull acting horizontally.

6.4b Crank at an angle of maximum twisting moment 
The twisting moment on the crankshaft will be maximum, when the tangential force Ft is 
maximum and this can be calculated graphically by taking pressures from the net effort 
diagram for different crank angles. The angle usually lies between 250 to 350from the 
dead center for a constant volume combustion engines and between 300 to 400 for 
constant pressure combustion engines. At this angle, the gas pressure will not be 
maximum. If Fp is the gas load along the cylinder centerline, then the thrust FC along the 
connecting rod is given by (Ref Figure 21 or same as FIG 3.1/50  in design data book)

Tangential force Ft will have two reactions RH1FT and RH2FT  at bearing 1 and 2 
respectively. 
Radial force Fr will have two reactions RH1FR and RH2FR   at bearing 1 and 2 respectively. 
The reactions at the bearings 2 and 3 due to belt pull (T1+T2) and Flywheel W will be 
same as before.  
In this position of the crankshaft, the different sections will be subjected to both bending 
and torsional moments and these must be checked for combined stress. At this point, 
Shear stress is taken as failure criteria for crankshaft.

6.4b.3 Right hand Crank Web: 
We have used empirical formulae to obtain the values of crank web dimensions. And also 
we know that the Right hand Crank Web is severely stressed. In order to find the 
correctness of the dimensions of the web it is necessary to check the developed stresses 
against the allowable stresses. This web is subjected to bending stresses in two planes 
normal to each other, due to radial and tangential components of FP; to direct 
compression; and to torsion.

Calculated σmax must be within limits. If it exceeds the safe limit, b can be increased 
since it does not affect any other dimension. 
 
6.4b.4 Left hand Crank Web: 
This crank web is less severely stressed than the right hand crank since it is not to 
transmit any power while the right hand crank transmits the power to the flywheel and to 
the power take off.   Hence there is no need to check the left hand crank and its 
dimensions may be taken as that of the right hand crank. 
6.4b.4 Crankshaft bearings:  
The distance between bearing 1 and bearing 2 may be assumed to be equal to twice  the 
cylinder diameter.  From the length of the crankpin and the thickness of the arm, the 
lengths of the bearings can be found out.  Bearing 2 is the most heavily loaded, therefore, 
only this bearing may be checked for the safe bearing pressure.

6.5 Analysis of side Crank Shaft: 
 The analysis of the side crankshaft is on the same lines as for centre crankshaft.  Before 
the crankshaft is checked for the positions of maximum bending moment and that of 
maximum twisting moment, the approximate dimensions for the crank pin and the 
journals may be found. 
The side or overhung crankshafts are used for medium size and large horizontal engines. 
Their main advantage is that it requires only two bearings in either the single or two 
crank constructions.  
 The analysis of the shaft is done at two positions:- 
1. When the crank is at dead centre (maximum bending moment) 
2. When the crank is at angle of maximum twisting moment.

In this position of the crank, there will be no twisting moment, and the various parts will 
be designed for bending only. 
If the student choose a wrong direction for RH2(F) due to gas force F,  then after solving we 
get negative value of RH2(F).  It clearly indicates that the chosen direction is wrong and 
further calculations are carried out by changing the direction of the reaction.

The length of the crankpin is approximately taken as (0.8 to 1.1) diameter of the 
crankpin.[Refer page no 50 of the data hand book] 
By taking suitable ratio of length to crank pin, and using equation (20), length and 
diameter of the pin can be obtained. 
The crankpin is now checked for bending stress. If it is assumed that the crankpin acts as

From equation (21) the diameter of the bearing can be obtained. Length of the bearing 
can be found by taking, l1=1.5d1 to 2d1. 
The bearing 2 is also made of the same diameter. The length of the bearing is found on 
the basis of allowable bearing pressure and maximum reactions at the bearings.

The twisting moment on the crankshaft will be maximum, when the tangential force Ft is 
maximum and this can be calculated graphically by taking pressures from the net effort 
diagram for different crank angles. The angle usually lies between 250 to 350from the 
dead center for a constant volume combustion engines and between 300 to 400 for 
constant pressure combustion engines. At this angle, the gas pressure will not be 
maximum. If Fp is the gas load along the cylinder centerline, then the thrust FC along the 
connecting rod is given by (Ref Figure 8 or same as FIG 3.1/50  in design data book)

The reactions at the bearings 1 and 2 due to belt pull (T1+T2) and Flywheel W will be 
same as before.  
In this position of the crankshaft, the different sections will be subjected to both bending

Problem No 4 
Design a plain carbon steel centre crankshaft for a single acting four stroke single 
cylinder engine for the following data: 
Bore = 400 mm; Stroke = 600 mm; Engine speed = 200 rpm.; Mean effective 
pressure = 0.5 N/mm2;  Maximum combustion pressure = 2.5 M/mm2; Weight of 
flywheel used a pulley = 50 kN; Total belt pull = 6.5 kN. 
 
When the crack has turned through 350 from the top dead centre, the pressure on the 
piston is 1N/mm2 and the torque on the crank is maximum.  The ratio of the 
connecting rod length to the crank radius is 5.  Assume any other date required for the 
design. 
 
Given Data: 
D=400mm,  L=600mm or R=300mm, pmean=0.5MPa, pmax=2.5MPa, W=50(10)3 N, 
T1+T2=6.5(10)3 N, θ=350, p35=1MPa, (l/R)=5 
 
Crankshaft is designed for the two positions: 
a) Crank is at dead center;  b) Angle of maximum twist; 
 
a) Design of the crankshaft when the crank is at the dead center

6.4b.3 Right hand Crank Web: 
We have used empirical formulae to obtain the values of crank web dimensions. And also 
we know that the Right hand Crank Web is severely stressed. In order to find the 
correctness of the dimensions of the web it is necessary to check the developed stresses 
against the allowable stresses. This web is subjected to bending stresses in two planes 
normal to each other, due to radial and tangential components of FP; to direct 
compression; and to torsion.  
 
The various dimensions obtained are  
w= 238mm; h=137mm; lp=157mm; dp=200mm;

the power take off.   Hence there is no need to check the left hand crank and its 
dimensions may be taken as that of the right hand crank. 
Crankshaft bearings:  
The distance between bearing 1 and bearing 2 may be assumed to be equal to twice the 
cylinder diameter.  From the length of the crankpin and the thickness of the arm, the 
lengths of the bearings can be found out.  Bearing 2 is the most heavily loaded, therefore, 
only this bearing may be checked for the safe bearing pressure.

Problem No 5  
Design a side or overhung crankshaft for a 250mm X 300 mm gas engine. The weight of 
the flywheel is 30kN and the explosion pressure is 2.1 MPa. The gas pressure at the 
maximum torque is 0.9 MPa, when the crank angle is 350 from I.D.C. The connecting rod 
is 4.5 times the crank radius. 
 
Given Data: 
D=250mm, L=300mm, or R=150mm, W=30(10)3N, pmax=2.1MPa and p35=0.9MPa, 
l/r=4.5 
Material taken: σb=allowable bending stress for the crankpin= 83MPa. (Refer T3.5b/48) 
Solution: 
Crankshaft is designed for the two positions: 
a) Crank is at dead center;  
b) Angle of maximum twist; 
 
a) Design of the crankshaft when the crank is at the dead center

Tangential force Ft will have two reactions RH1FT and RH2FT at bearing 1 and 2 
respectively. 
Radial force Fr will have two reactions RH1FR and RH2FR   at bearing 1 and 2 respectively. 
The reactions at the bearings 1 and 2 due to Flywheel Weight W will be same as before.  
In this position of the crankshaft, the different sections will be subjected to both bending 
and torsional moments and these must be checked for combined stress. At this point, 
Shear stress is taken as failure criteria for crankshaft.

Design of crank web  
The dimensions are taken same as calculated in crank at dead center. 
The same dimensions are checked here for combined stress. 
Width of crank web w=216.3mm 
Thickness of crank web h=66mm 
 
The most critical section is where the web joins the shaft. This section is subjected to the 
following stresses: 
i) 
Bending stress due to the tangential force FT 
ii) 
Bending stress due to the radial force Fr 
iii) 
Direct compressive stress due to radial force Fr and  
iv) 
Shear stress due to the twisting moment of FT.
