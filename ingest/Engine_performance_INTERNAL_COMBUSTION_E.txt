Power and torque
•
Engine performance is specified in both in terms of power and engine
torque - which is more important?
– Wheel torque = engine torque x gear ratio tells you whether you can 
climb the hill
– Gear ratio in transmission typically 3:1 or 4:1 in 1st gear, 1:1 in 
highest gear; gear ratio in differential typically 3:1
• Ratio of engine revolutions to wheel revolutions varies from 12:1 in 
lowest gear to 3:1 in highest gear
– Power tells you how fast you can climb the hill
– Torque can be increased by transmission (e.g. 2:1 gear ratio ideally 
multiplies torque by 2)
– Power can't be increased by transmission; in fact because of friction 
and other losses, power will decrease in transmission
– Power tells how fast you can accelerate or how fast you can climb a 
hill, but power to torque ratio ~ N tells you what gear ratios you'll need 
to do the job
P (in horsepower) º N (revolutions per minute, RPM) x Torque (in foot pounds)

Knock - what is it?
•
Occurs when the combination of piston compression + “flame 
compression” increases temperature and pressure of the end gas 
until a very rapid explosion 
•
Engine combustion is always “horse race” between flame 
propagation (good horse) and knock (bad horse)

Knock - why is it bad?
•
Pressure gradients cause enormous stresses on the piston
•
As the shocks propagate into the narrow region between the 
piston and cylinder wall (the “crevice volume”), the shock strength 
increases, causing locally even more severe damage

•
Shock formation causes “ringing” of pressure waves back & forth 
across cylinder - sounds like you're hitting piston with a hammer, 
which isn't too far from the truth

Average piston speed for a standard auto engine 
is ~15 m/s.  Ultimately limited by material strength.  
Therefore engines with large strokes run at lower 
speeds those with small strokes can run
at higher speeds.

The torque exerted by the engine is: T = F b  with units: J
The power P delivered by the engine turning at a speed N and 
absorbed by the dynamometer is:

Note: is the shaft angular velocity with units: rad/s
Indicated Work
Given the cylinder pressure data over the operating
cycle of the engine one can calculate the work done
by the gas on the piston.

Power can be increased by increasing:
• the engine size, Vd
• compression ratio, rc
• engine speed, N
Indicated Power
Mechanical Efficiency
Some of the power generated in the cylinder is used
to overcome engine friction.  The friction power is
used to describe these losses:
Pf = Pi - Pb
Friction power can be measured by motoring the engine.
The mechanical efficiency is defined as:
m = Pb / Pi = 1- (Pf / Pi )
Mechanical efficiency depends on throttle position, engine
design, and engine speed.   Typical values for car engines
at WOT are 90% @2000 RPM and 75% @ max speed.
There is a maximum in the brake power 
versus engine speed called the rated
brake power. 
At higher speeds brake power decreases as 
friction power becomes significant compared 
to the indicated power 
There is a maximum in the torque versus 
speed called maximum brake torque (MBT).
Brake torque drops off: 
• at lower speeds do to heat losses 
• at higher speeds it becomes more difficult
to ingest a full charge of air.
Max brake torque
1 kW = 1.341 hp
Rated brake power
Power and Torque versus Engine Speed
Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP)
imep is a fictitious constant pressure that would produce the same 
work per cycle if it acted on the piston during the power stroke.
imep = Wi / Vd = (Pi nR) / (Vd N)
so Pi = imep Vd N / nR = imep Ap Up / (2 nR)
imep does not depend on engine speed, just like torque.
imep is a better parameter than torque to compare engines for design and 
output because it is independent of engine speed, N, and engine size, Vd.
Brake mean effective pressure (bmep) is defined as:

Maximum BMEP
• The maximum bmep is obtained at WOT at a particular engine speed
• Closing the throttle decreases the bmep
• For a given displacement, a higher maximum bmep means more torque
• For a given torque, a higher maximum bmep means smaller engine 
• Higher maximum bmep means higher stresses and temperatures in the 
engine hence shorter engine life, or bulkier engine.
• For the same bmep 2-strokes have almost twice the power of 4-stroke

Specific Fuel Consumption
• For transportation vehicles fuel economy is generally given as
mpg, or liters/100 km.
• In engine testing the fuel consumption is measured in terms of
the fuel mass flow rate.
• The specific fuel consumption, sfc, is a measure of how efficiently
the fuel supplied to the engine is used to produce power,
.           .  
bsfc = mf / Pb
isfc = mf / Pi
(w/units: g/kW-hr)
• Clearly a low value for sfc is desirable since at a given power
level less fuel will be consumed
Brake Specific Fuel Consumption vs Size
•BSFC decreases with engine size due to reduced heat losses
from gas to cylinder wall.

•Note: cylinder surface to volume ratio increases with bore diameter.
Brake Specific Fuel Consumption vs Speed
• At high speeds the bsfc increases due to increased friction
• At lower speeds the bsfc increases due to increased time for heat
losses from the gas to the cylinder and piston wall
• Bsfc increases with compression ratio due to higher thermal efficiency
• There is a minimum in the bsfc versus engine speed curve
Performance Maps
Performance map is used to display the bsfc over the engines full load 
and speed range.  Using a dynamometer to measure the torque and fuel 
mass flow rate you can calculate:
bmep = 2T nR / Vd
Pb = 2N T
Constant bsfc contours from a 
two-liter four cylinder SI engine
bmep@WOT
.
bsfc = mf / Pb
Combustion Efficiency
• The time for combustion in the cylinder is very short so
not all the fuel may be consumed or local temperatures
may not support combustion
• A small fraction of the fuel may not react and exits with the
exhaust gas.  The combustion efficiency is defined as
actual heat input divided by theoretical heat input:
Where Qin = heat added by combustion per cycle
mf = mass of fuel added to cylinder per cycle
QHV = heating value of the fuel (chemical energy per unit mass)
.   .
c = Qin/ (mf QHV)  = Qin / (mf QHV)
Thermal Efficiency
• Thermal efficiencies can be given in terms of brake or indicated values
• Indicated thermal efficiencies are typically 50% to 60% and brake
thermal efficiencies are usually about 30% 
t = work per cycle / heat input per cycle
t = W / Qin = W / (c mf QHV)
or in terms of rates…
t = power out/rate of heat input
.        .
t = P/Qin =  P/(c mf QHV)
Arbitrary Efficiency
(aka fuel conversion efficiency)
Note: hf is very similar to ht, the difference is that ht takes into
account only the actual fuel combusted in the engine.
.
Recall that sfc = mf / Pb
Thus f = 1 / (sfc QHV)
. 
f = Wb / (mf QHV) = Pb / (mf QHV)
Volumetric Efficiency
• Due to the short cycle time and flow restrictions less than ideal
amount of air enters the cylinder. 
• The effectiveness of an engine to induct air into the cylinders is
measured by the volumetric efficiency which is the ratio of actual
air inducted divided by the theoretical air inducted:
.
v = ma / (a Vd) = nR ma / (a Vd N)
where a is the density of air at atmospheric conditions Po, To for an
ideal gas ra =Po / RaTo and Ra = 0.287 kJ/kg-K (at standard conditions
a= 1.181 kg/m3)
• Typical values for WOT are in the range 75%-90%, and lower when
the throttle is closed
Air-Fuel Ratio
• For combustion to take place, the proper ratio of air and fuel
must be present in the cylinder.
•The air-fuel ratio is defined as
.  .
AF = ma / mf = ma / mf
• The ideal AF is about 15:1, with homogenous combustion
possible in the range of 6 to 19.
• For a SI engine the AF is in the range of 12 to 18 depending
on the operating conditions.
• For a CI engine, where the mixture is highly non-homogeneous
and the AF is in the range of 18 to 70.

Engine Capacity Vs Performance
Optimizing Engine Performance
• Engines are most efficient at or near peak load.
• Efficiency drops with a reduction in torque load.
• At zero brake torque, all fuel energy is expended in engine 
friction.
• Lower rated engine speeds provide lower BSFC, and at the 
same time reduce torque reserve – design compromise.
• Heavy engines for a given capacity….. More inertial losses…
• Compromise – Necessary Evil …..
• Any alternate to overcome this fact…..
• Develop an idea to Change natural behaviour…..
