Abstract 
Crankshaft is large volume manufacture constituent with a multifaceted geometry in the I.C Engine. This transforms the 
reciprocating or the to and fro movement of the piston into a rotary motion of the crank. An effort is made in this research paper 
to comprehend and study the Static analysis on a crankshaft from a single cylinder 1000cc 4-stroke I.C Engine. The designing of 
the crankshaft is done using CATIA-V5 Software. Finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to gain the variation of stress at 
critical and serious locations and positions of the crank shaft using the ANSYS software and applying the suitable boundary 
conditions as per the need. Franz Langer held the record for the biggest and the largest displacement single cylinder motorbike 
engine, with a 1000cc thumper built in 1998; and this invention really made a dent in the universe. Further the enhancements were 
made in this design and presently the beast holds a capacity of 2000 cc, commissioning a single cylinder only.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Crank shaft is a big component with a complex geometry in the I.C engine, which converts the reciprocating drive of the piston to 
a rotary motion with a four-bar link mechanism. 
 Crankshaft involves shaft parts, two journal bearings and one crankpin bearing. In addition to this, the linear displacement of an 
engine is not smooth; as the displacement is caused by the combustion chamber therefore the displacement has sudden shocks. The 
idea of employing crankshaft is to modify these sudden displacements to a very even rotary output, which is obviously the input 
to various devices such as generators, pumps and compressors. It should also be specified that the use of a flywheel helps in 
levelling the shocks. 
Combustion and inertia forces acting on the crankshaft. 
1) Torsional load 
2) Bending load. 
Crankshaft must be robust enough to take the downward force of the power stroke without excessive bending so the reliability and 
life of the internal combustion engine depend on the strength of the crankshaft largely. 
 The crank pin is like a built-in beam with a distributed load along its length that varies with crank positions. Each web is like a 
cantilever beam subjected to bending and twisting. 
1) Bending moment which causes tensile and compressive stresses.

2) Twisting moment causes shear stress. 
 There are many sources of failure in the engine one of the most common crankshaft failure is fatigue at the fillet areas due to 
the bending load causes by the combustion. The moment of combustion the load from the piston is transmitted to the crankpin, 
causing a large bending moment on the entire geometry of the crankshaft. At the root of the fillet areas stress concentrations exist 
and these high stress range locations are the points where cyclic loads could cause fatigue crank initiation leading to fracture. 
II. RECOGNITION OF NEED 
Franz Langer held the record for the largest displacement single cylinder motorcycle engine, with a 1000cc thumper built in 
1998.Further the improvements were made in this design and currently the beast holds a capacity of 2000 cc, employing a single 
cylinder only. 
 Now, for such a beast there must be a finely and carefully designed crankshaft to ensure the proper working of the I.C engine; 
thus, a need for designing this crankshaft was felt. 
 However, in our project we are trying to reproduce a crankshaft that would have been used in that original engine by following 
the fundamental steps of machine design.

The crank is at angle with the line of dead centre positions and subjected to maximum torsional moment. 
1) Step 1: The crank angle (𝜃) for maximum torsional moment condition is given as 25° . 
Since, p1 is gas pressure on the piston top for maximum torque condition. 
PP = (𝜋𝐷2/4) p1 
= 24543.69 N 
sin ∅= 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃/(
𝐿
𝑟) 
= 0.09392 
Thus, ∅= 5.39° 
Now, the thrust on connecting rod (PQ) is given by, 
PQ = PP/ cos∅ 
= 24652.69 N 
Therefore, Pt = PQ sin (𝜃+∅) 
= 12471.38 N 
 
PR = PQ cos (𝜃+∅) 
= 21265.46 N 
2) Step 2: Bearing reactions 
The forces acting on the centre crankshaft are at an angle of maximum torque. 
The crankshaft is supported on three bearings. 
Let us assume, 
b = 250 mm and c = 300 mm 
b1= b2 = b/2 = (250/2) = 125mm 
c1= c2 = c/2 = 150 mm 
By symmetry, 
(R1) v = (R2) v = (PR/2) = 10632.73 N 
(R1) h = (R2) h = (Pt/2) = 6235.69 N 
(R2’) v = (R3’) v = 500 N 
(R2’) h = (R3’) h = 1000 N 
3) Step 3: Design of crank pin the central plane of the crank pin is subjected to the bending moment Mb due to (R1) v and torsional 
moment MT due to (R1) h. 
Let us assume, allowable shear stress = 40 Mpa. 
The diameter of the crank pin (dc) is,

dc3 = (16*√(Mb2 + MT2))/2 
= 179.4 * 103 
dc = 56.4 mm 
But, considering the bending stress also into account let us assume the dc = 65 mm = lc 
4) Step 4: Design of shaft under ﬂywheel 
Suppose, dS = diameter of shaft under ﬂywheel (mm) 
The central plane of the shaft is subjected to maximum bending moment due to the reaction R3. 
Mb = (R3)* c2 
It is also subjected to torsional moment Mt due to tangential component Pt. 
MT = PT * r 
R3 = √(500)2 + (1000)2 
= 1118.03 mm 
ds3 = (16*√(Mb2 + MT2))/𝜏𝜋) 
= 120.99 * 103 
ds = 50 mm 
5) Step V: Design of shaft at the juncture of right-hand crank web 
The cross-section of the shaft under ﬂywheel at the juncture of the right-hand crank web is subjected to the following moments: 
Bending moment in vertical plane, (Mb)v 
Bending moment in horizontal plane, (Mb)h 
Torsional moment MT 
(Mb)v = (R1)v (b1 + lc/2 + t/2) – Pr (lc /2 + t/2) 
= 738.97 *103 N-mm 
(Mb)h  =  (R1)h(b1 + lc/2 + t/2) – Pt (lc /2 + t/2) 
= 433.38 * 103 N-mm 
The resultant bending moment Mb is: 
856.68* 103 N-mm 
The diameter of the shaft ds1 is: 
ds13 = (16*√(Mb2 + MT2))/𝜏𝜋) 
= 161.5 * 103 
ds1 = 55mm 
6) Step 6: Design of right-hand crank web 
The right-hand crank web is subjected to the following stresses: 
Bending stresses in vertical and horizontal planes due to radial component Pr and tangential component Pt respectively. 
Direct compressive stress due to radial component Pr. 
Torsional shear stresses. 
The bending moment due to the radial component is given by, 
(Mb)r = (R2)v [ b2 – lc/2 – t/2] 
= 738.97 * 103 N - mm 
Also, (Mb)r  = (𝜎b)r *(wt2/6) 
Thus, (𝜎b)r  =  27.94 Mpa 
Also, 
The tangential stress due to tangential component at the juncture of the crank web and shaft is: 
(𝜎b)t  = 13.74 Mpa 
The direct compressive stress due to radial component is given by, 
(𝜎c)d = Pr/2wt = 3.08 Mpa 
The maximum compressive stress (sc) is given by: 
(𝜎c) =  (𝜎c)d  +   (𝜎b)t   +  (𝜎b)r 
= 44.76 Mpa 
The torsional moment on the arm is 
Mt = (R2)h * ( b2 – lc/2) 
= 576.80 *103 N-mm 
The maximum compressive stress is given by, 
(𝜎c)maX = 0.5 * [ 𝜎c +  √{ (𝜎c)2 + 4𝜏2 }] 
= 50.10 Mpa 
7) Step 7:  Design of left-hand crank web 
The left-hand crank web is not severely stressed to the extent of the right-hand crank web. Therefore, it is not necessary to check 
the stresses in the left-hand crank web. The thickness and width of the left-hand crank web are made equal to that of the right-hand 
crank web from balancing consideration.
