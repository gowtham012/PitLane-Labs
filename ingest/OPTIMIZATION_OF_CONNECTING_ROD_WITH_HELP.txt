OPTIMIZATION OF CONNECTING ROD 
WITH HELP OF FEA 
Sharma Manoj and Shashikant 
Uttar Pradesh Technical University, U. P., India 
ABSTRACT  
Connecting rod is the important part of an IC Engine it transmits motion 
of piston to crank shaft and converts translating motion of piston into rotary 
motion and vice versa. 
From application point of view it is necessary that connecting rod must be 
light in weight and having good strength under fatigue or reverse loading. For 
this purpose generally material of connecting rod is carbon steel of aluminum 
alloy. 
In this work we take connecting rod of a Mahindra Jeep CJ-340 and 
change its material from Al360 to PEEK. The modeling of the connecting rod 
is done on Pro-E wildfire 4.0 and analysis work is done on ANSYS 11.0. 
The parameters like Von misses stress, Von messes strain and 
displacement was obtained from ANSYS software which shows reduction in 
weight and improvement in strength.  
Key words: Connecting Rod, Optimization, Pro-E, ANSYS

1. INTRODUCTION 
The connecting rod is a major link inside a combustion engine. It connects the piston 
to the crankshaft and is responsible for transferring power from the piston to the 
crankshaft and sending it to the transmission. There are different types of materials 
and production methods used in the creation of connecting rods. The most common 
types of Connecting rods are steel and aluminum. The most common types of 
manufacturing processes are casting, forging and powdered metallurgy. Connecting 
rods are widely used in variety of engines such as, in-line engines, V-engine, opposed 
cylinder engines, radial engines and opposed-piston engines. A connecting rod 
consists of a pin-end, a shank section, and a crank-end. Pin-end and crank-end

pinholes at the upper and lower ends are machined to permit accurate fitting of 
bearings. 
The function of connecting rod is to transmit the thrust of the piston to the 
crankshaft. Figure shows the role of connecting rod in the conversion of reciprocating 
motion into rotary motion. A four-stroke engine is the most common type. The four 
strokes are intake, compression, power, and exhaust. Each stroke requires 
approximately 180 degrees of crankshaft rotation, so the complete cycle would take 
720 degrees. Each stroke plays a very important role in the combustion process. In the 
intake cycle, while the piston moves downward, one of the valves open. This creates a 
vacuum, and an air-fuel mixture is sucked into the chamber (Figure 1). During the 
second stroke compression occurs. In compression both valves are closed, and the 
piston moves upward and thus creates a pressure on the piston, see Figure 2. The next 
stroke is power. During this process the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited with a 
spark, causing a tremendous pressure as the fuel burns. The forces exerted by piston 
transmitted through the connecting rod moves the crankshaft, see Figure 3. Finally, 
the exhaust stroke occurs. In this stroke, the exhaust valve opens, as the piston moves 
back upwards, it forces all the air out of the chamber and thus which completes the 
cycle of crankshaft rotation Figure 4.

Connecting rods are highly dynamically loaded components used for power 
transmission in combustion engines. The optimization of connecting rod had already 
started as early year 1983 by Webster and his team. However, each day consumers are 
looking for the best from the best. That’s why the optimization is really important 
especially in automotive industry. Optimization of the component is to make the less 
time to produce the product that is stronger, lighter and less cost. The design and 
weight of the connecting rod influence on car performance [5−8]. Hence, it is effect 
on the car manufacture credibility. Change in the structural design and also material 
will be significant increments in weight and performance of the engine. Mirehei et al. 
(2008) were performed the study regarding the fatigue of connecting rod on universal

tractor (U650) by using ANSYS software application and the lifespan was estimated. 
The authors also investigated that the stresses and hotspots experienced by the 
connecting rod and the state of stress as well as stress concentration factors can be 
obtained and consequently used for life predictions. Rahman et al. (2008a, 2009a) 
discuss about FEA of the cylinder block of the free piston engine. The 4 nodes 
tetrahedral (TET4) element version of the cylinder block was used for the initial 
analysis. The comparison then are made between TET4 and 10 nodes tetrahedral 
(TET10) element mesh while using the same global mesh length for the highest 
loading conditions (7.0 MPa) in the combustion chamber.

5. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF CONNECTING ROD 
5.1. Load Distribution on Connecting Rod 
For static structural analysis, load is applied at the piston end and fixed support is 
given at the crank end. The analysis is carried out under axial loads. Here the axial 
load applied is 28000 N (Compressive). The comparisons are done for optimization 
purpose [3, 4]. 
6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
6.1. Static Structural Analysis of Connecting Rod 
Static structural analysis of connecting rod under compressive loading is carried out 
using ANSYS 11.0 software.
