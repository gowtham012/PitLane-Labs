Abstract. Stress analysis of a crankshaft using traditional method is complicated and 
needs modification by considering its stress concentration factors. To solve this problem, 
the crankshaft strength of a four-cylinder four stroke gasoline engine is modeled and 
analyzed using finite element method (FEM) in this paper. For this purpose, the 
crankshaft is modeled using CATIA software in detail. Then, the model is imported in 
ANSYS. In the recent software, the model is meshed into a number of finite elements. 
After defining the boundary and loading conditions, the stresses occur in the crankshaft 
are analyzed in order to identify critical locations on it. 
1 Introduction  
Engine crankshaft is an important component of an engine as it converts the reciprocating 
displacement of the piston to a rotary motion. The crankshaft effectively absorbs forces from the 
explosion, transmits energy to the engine flywheel, which transfers energy to a shaft connected to the 
driven machinery [1]. Since the crankshaft experiences a large number of load cycles during its 
service life, it is important to study and analyze the strength of this component in evaluating their 
performance and lifetime of the crankshaft.  
In the traditional crankshaft stress calculation methods, such as the method of beam supported of 
both ends and the continuous beam method, the calculation process is complicated and needs to 
modify the crankshaft stress that calculated by stress concentration factor [2]. Finite element method 
(FEM) is a numerical calculation method based on variation principle for solving mathematical and 
physical problems [3]. Besides, it is a powerful tool to analyze various structural problems and 
provide theoretical basic for the design [4].  
The objective of the paper is to model the four-cylinder four stroke gasoline engine crankshaft 
geometry using CATIA, and then analyze the stresses occur in it under loading conditions using 
ANSYS. Critical locations will be identified based on the results of finite element analysis given by 
the ANSYS software.

2.1 Engine crankshaft modeling  
Several various reasonable simplifications were made in the finite element analysis. Petty details such as fillet, 
chamfering and so on were given up and only the relative importance features is left, such as done in Ref. [3]. 
These simplifications were necessary as to avoid the incomplete part when the model imported from CATIA 
software, see Figure 3, to the ANSYS software for the finite element analysis part as shown in Figure 4. It found 
that the mistakes frequently occurred for the incomplete part of the crankshaft in the grid analysis used in ANSYS 
software. Furthermore, the simplification made due to the of lack accurate geometric information for some parts 
of the crankshaft. Since the needed result from the analysis was the strength of the crankshaft, small errors could 
be occur by ignoring some chamfers and fillets. The position drawn of the crankshaft is in Top Dead Center 
(TDC) position.

2.2 Model meshing 
Meshing is the procedure of cutting the structure into several elements. Then the connection between 
elements defined as nodes that hold elements together as if the nodes were pins or drops of glue. This 
process results in a set of simultaneous algebraic equations [1]. The mesh type selected for the model 
is tetrahedrons with 77442 elements number and 117685 nodes number as shown in the figure below. 
Greater the fineness of the model mesh, the better accuracy of the result. In order to analysis the 
strength of crankshaft, the material attribute of the model must be define. The material of the 
crankshaft is QT-800 (gray cast iron), where the mass density, Poisson’s ratio, Young’s modulus and 
the tensile strength are 7800 kg/m3, 0.28, 210 GPa and 345 GPa, respectively. 
3 Finite Element Analysis  
3.1 Load constraints  
According to the crankshaft actual working condition, the major force on the crankshaft is generated 
by interaction between the mixture of fuel and air combustion and the piston. Piston is connected to 
crankshaft by a connection rod at the crankpin. While the crankshaft is operated at high rotational 
motion, the bending load acts directly to the crankshaft through connecting road. The crankshaft 
analyzed in this project is one of the gasoline engine. Generally, it is also known as a spark-ignition 
(S.I) engine.  
 
Figure 5. Piston formation and top dead center 
(TDC) position. 
 
Figure 6. Forces acting on the crankshaft. 
In four stroke spark-ignition engine, four piston strokes required to complete one cycle [5]. The 
first strokes known as induction stroke where it created mixture of air and fuel as the piston moves 
away from cylinder head. The second stroke is compression stroke where it compressed the fuel and 
air mixture towards cylinder head. For the third stroke known as power stroke whose produced the 
highest force of the engine where the spark plug ignites the fuel and air mixture and pushed the piston 
downward. While the last stroke known as exhaust strokes works as to remove the exhaust gas of fuel 
and air combustion to the air. These formations of engine piston made the engine crankshaft at it top 
dead center (TDC) position which is studied in this paper as shown in Figure 5. 
From the operation of the engine piston, it produced four different value pressures acting to the 
engine crankshaft. The maximum or the highest pressure produced by the power stroke is 60 bar, 
while induction stroke produced 0.12 bar, the compression stroke produced 14 bar and exhaust stroke 
produced 5 bar of pressure [4]. The force imposed to crankshaft calculated using mathematical 
equation of P = F/A with the bore diameter of the engine cylinder is 82 mm. This force is assumed to 
be acting at the crankpin center point as shown in Figure 6.

3.2 Boundary conditions  
The definition of boundary condition has a direct relationship to the type of the meshing model. 
Therefore, it must be carefully defined in order to be similar to the engine crankshaft actual working 
condition. Some simplified assumption has to be justified in order to establish the boundary condition 
in this paper: (1) The torque acting to the crankshaft is ignored. Only bending moment is considered in 
this analysis. Engine crankshaft mostly affected by the bending moment causing tensile and 
compressive stresses. (2) The mass force is included in the program itself. As the material defined in 
the program, it automatically provides the value of the mass based on the crankshaft density. 
Therefore, mass force boundary condition excluded.

Figure 8. Frictionless support on crankshaft. 
The engine crankshaft is supported at both flywheel mounting flange and crank nose part. 
Therefore, it restricted the movement in x, y and z direction as shown in Figure 7. Based on Figure 8, 
the movement of the crankshaft journal is constrained in x and y direction as the bearing restricted the 
movement.

4 Result and Discussion 
After all the requirement data and steps fulfill in the program, the result calculated by the software. 
From Figure 9 and 10, it shows the deformation of engine crankshaft and stress concentration region 
resemble to actual working condition. Based from Figure 9, the maximum displacement value is 0.013 
mm located at the counterweight part of crankshaft. Besides that, Figure 10 shows that the second 
crankpin from right became high stress concentration regions which suffered the largest stress and 
most easily broken. While according to Figure 11 shows the stress maximum point located at the edge 
of crankpin which value is 45.35 MPa. Furthermore, the shear stress maximum value calculated by the 
program is 22.17 MPa located opposite to the maximum stress point as shown in Figure 12. From the

value obtained by the software, it can be conclude that the crankpin parts of the engine crankshaft 
appeared to be the danger zone with high stress.

5 Conclusion 
Modeling the geometry and analysis the crankshaft using CATIA and ANSYS software has been done 
in this paper. The loads on the crankpin were modeled as surface forces. In the analysis, only bending 
loads were considered, while torsional loads were neglected.  
Under 60 bars pressure, results indicate that the maximum stress on the crankshaft is 43.35 MPa and it 
occurs at the point located on the edge of crankpin. The value of maximum shear stress happening is 
22.17 MPa and it takes place at the opposite side of the point with maximum stress.
