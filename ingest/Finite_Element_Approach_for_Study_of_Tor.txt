Abstract:    In high-speed diesel engine the problem of torsional vibration of the crankshaft has become critical 
with increase in excitation forces. This results in high torsional vibration amplitudes and hence high stresses .This 
paper aims at complete FEM analysis of a crankshaft for torsional and bending vibrations & identification of 
stresses. It is analyzed for natural frequency, rigid body mode shape by ANSYS. . The complete simulation of 
actual boundary conditions is done for journal bearing support, inertia lumping for reciprocating parts and 
bearing stiffness. ANSYS-programme, which will convert user input Pressure-Crank angle variation to excitation 
forces for various orders through FFT. The dynamic responses obtained for displacement and stresses. Finally all 
results are combined to obtain the variation of Fillet Stress as a function of engine speed and harmonic orders. The 
critical dynamic response is compared with results obtained experimentally for torsional amplitudes. The 
parametric optimization has been done to increase the frequency it means the higher the frequency higher the 
stiffness or strength with optimum weight of the component.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Crankshaft is one of the most important moving parts in internal combustion engine. Crankshaft is a large component with 
a complex geometry in the engine, which converts the reciprocating displacement of the piston into a rotary motion. 
Crankshaft consists of the shaft parts which revolve in the main bearings, the crankpins to which the big ends of the 
connected rod are connected the crank arms to webs (also called cheeks) which connect the crankpins and the shaft parts. 
The crankshaft main- journals rotate in a set of supporting bearings (main bearings) causing the offset road journals to 
rotate in circular path around the main journal centers. 
  
The complicated geometry of crankshaft and the complex torque applied by cylinders make their analysis difficult. But 
optimized meshing and accurate simulation of boundary conditions along with ability to apply complex torque provided 
by various FEM packages have helped the designer to carry torsional vibration analysis with the investigation of critical 
stresses.FEM enables to find critical locations and quantitative analysis of the stress distribution and deformed shapes 
under loads. The specific engine crankshaft of a major automobile company (the name is kept confidential) is taken as the 
model for the analysis. 
 
Objectives: The project aims at detail FEM analysis of crankshaft. The following are the main objectives of the project. 
 
1. Building a 3-D Solid parametric model of crankshaft, Flywheel and pulley in Pro-Engineer wild fire.

2. Meshing the model by Tetrahedral Solid 285 elements in Ansys. MPC 184 element is also used to define the journal 
bearings. 
3. Rigid body modes and Normal modes- we have calculated in free vibration analysis for Crankshaft. 
4. Experimental modal analysis carried out using FFT ANALYSER MACHINE to validate our CAE work. 
5. Behaviour of torsional modes, bending modes and combined modes of vibration we have studied for all systems. 
6. ANSYS program is used to find out the Ft and Fr forces from given P and  diagram. 
7. C programming is used to find out the T and  diagram from corresponding P and  diagram. 
8. Dynamic response and investigation of critical stresses are found out by incorporating the boundary conditions at the 
journal bearing positions. And tangential and radial forces on corresponding nodes. 
9. Durability analysis has done to check the strength of the crankshaft with different radial and tangential forces. 
10. The parametric optimization has been done to increase the frequency it means the higher the frequency higher the 
stiffness or strength with optimum weight of the component. 
 
Crankshaft Vibrations:  In I.C. engines various types of excitation forces exist. These directly or indirectly affect the 
crankshaft dynamics. 
The major types of these vibrations are: 
  • Torsional vibrations: shows spatial view of a 4-cylinder engine crankshaft. In multi-cylinder engine crankshafts, the 
crank throws are spatial or out of phase with each other for the balancing purpose. It is also attached with a flywheel and some 
driven system. The torque is applied to the crankpin by the connecting rod. This torque is of varying nature because of 
variation in gas pressure and inertia forces. The fluctuating torque at the crankpin causes the twisting and untwisting 
periodically. Hence the torsional vibrations are induced. 
• Flexural vibrations: The lateral periodic motion of crankshaft under the fluctuating forces exerted by connecting rod at 
crankpin cause bending vibrations of crankshaft. This mode shape generally has many nodes because the bending vibrations 
are strongly reacted at the bearings. 
• Axial vibrations: The torsional vibrations can cause axial vibration in the twisting and untwisting motion. Also radial 
forces at crankpin cause some axial movement of crankthrow. 
• Coupled vibrations: In general, however the various modes of vibration are coupled so that vibrations of one type can't 
occur without an accompanying vibration of the other type. These are not troublesome if there is considerable spread 
between the natural frequencies of the modes of vibration involved; i.e. the modes get weakly coupled. 
 
Influence of Crankshaft Vibrations: 
The crankshaft vibrations badly affect the working of engine. 
The major areas are as follows. 
 
1. The torsional vibrations cause the angular velocities of all the cranks to vary but not in the same proportions. The crank 
away from the node has maximum effects compared to crank near the node. This affects the balancing. 
 
2. Due to same reason discussed above, stresses of varying intensity are generated in whole length of the crankshaft. 
These are also fluctuating in nature and hence cause fatigue of crankshaft, reducing its life. The stresses induced are 
dangerous at fillet or oil-hole locations. 
 
3. Vibratory energy is transmitted to all parts of the structure where it causes structural damage. 
 
4. It induces noisy operation of engine, which is undesirable in passenger cars. It also causes wear of all running parts.

II. SOLID MODELING OF CRANKSHAFT 
 
As a prerequisite to the finite element model is the physical geometry of the part i.e. the suspension link we have created 
using Prove-Wildfire software. 
 
 
Fig 1. Solid Modeling of Crankshaft 
 
III.  MESH GENERATION 
 
Meshing generally falls in two categories depending on the geometry of the element. For a 3D machine element of regular 
shape, solid meshing is sufficient, but for irregular geometries we have to first use surface meshing and then solid 
meshing.  
We have done surface meshing first by Solid 183 element. One of the important aspect in surface meshing is merging of 
nodes or technically it can be called node equivalence. Once the node equivalence is confirmed we have to go for free-
edge checking which will ensure that there are no free surfaces.            Now, after free surface check is done, we go for 
quality check, the quality check in Ansys  is a unique feature as it allows us not only to check for internal and external 
angles of the mesh element but also facilitates in checking aspect ratio, warpage ratio, skew ratio, and most important the 
Jacobian matrix. The value of the Jacobian matrix should always lie between 0 and 1. Any other value of the Jacobian 
matrix renders the element faulty and a new element should be created by deleting the previous one. In our case the value 
of Jacobian matrix is 0.7 
Once assured with a safe and sound surface meshing our next step is to import the model in ANSYS for solid meshing.  
The element used for solid meshing is 10 Node Solid 187 Tetrahedral Element. The special features of this element are 
Plasticity, Creep, Swelling, Stress stiffening, Large deflection, Large strain, Birth and death. 
 
MPC184 
 
Multipoint Constraint Elements: Rigid Link, Rigid Beam, Slider, Spherical, Revolute, Universal MPC184 comprises a 
general class of multipoint constraint elements that implement kinematic constraints using Lagrange multipliers. The 
elements are loosely classified here as “constraint elements” and “joint elements”. All of these elements are used in 
situations that require you to impose some kind of constraint to meet certain requirements. The constraint may be as 
simple as that of identical displacements at a joint. They can also be more complicated, such as those that involve rigid 
modeling of parts, or kinematic constraints that transmit motion between flexible bodies in a particular way. For example, 
a structure may consist of some rigid parts and some moving parts connected together by some rotational or sliding 
connections. The rigid part of the structure may be modeled using the MPC184 Link/Beam elements, while the moving 
parts may be connected with the MPC184 slider, spherical, revolute, or universal joint element. Since these elements are 
implemented using Lagrange multipliers, the constraint forces and moments are available for output purposes. This 
element is used to define the connectivity between the point of application of force and the nodded on the surface of the 
structural member.

VI. ANALYSIS FOR RADIAL FORCE 
 
We get radial and tangential force values from ANSYS macro. Further we apply these forces on crankshaft and solve it 
with ANSYS solver. 
To get the effect of bending forces on the crankshaft, we have applied the radial forces Fr on the crankpin positions and 
the displacement constraints is applied at the multiple journal bearing positions. The study of maximum stress 
distributions around the fillet which may be stress concentration region is our objective.  Fig. shows application of radial 
force.

VII. ANALYSIS FOR TANGENTIAL FORCE 
 
We get tangential force values from ANSYS, and further we apply these forces on crankshaft. 
To get the effect of torsional forces on the crankshaft, we have applied the tangential forces Ft on the crankpin positions 
and the displacement constraints is applied at the end of one side journal bearing positions to see the effect of toque 
developed by tangential forces at different lobes of crankshaft. The study of maximum stress distributions around the 
crankpin positions, which may be stress concentration region is our objective.

VIII. PARAMETRIC OPTIMISATION 
 
To study the effect of different dimensional parameters on stiffness and frequency of the crank shaft. The parametric 
optimization has been done to increase the frequency it means the higher the frequency higher the stiffness or strength 
with optimum weight of the component. 
In Ansys the Optimization begins with building a parametric model of the initial design and creating an analysis file. 
 
 
Fig. 14 Steps of optimization in Ansys 
  
There are four main steps (assuming that the analysis file is available): 
1. 
Identify the analysis file 
2. 
Identify optimization variables - DVs, SVs, and objective function

IX.  DICUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
 
1. Experimental validation of crankshaft is done using FFT analyser. The values of FFT output and Modal frequency 
calculated from ANSYS and Hypermesh validates the results as both are matching. 
2. The mode shape calculation of different systems of component is done using modal analysis. The effect of flywheel 
and pulley shows the natural frequency is decreasing due to additional masses at the end of crankshaft. 
3. The bending mode, torsion mode and combined mode frequency values calculated by Ansys shows the actual 
working condition deformation during high speed rotation rpm value of crankshaft. 
4. As the stress concentration area for radial forces is fillet and for tangential force it is crankpin positions. Both the 
stresses plot study shows the critical stress region. 
5. We conclude our results and discussion by viewing displacement plot for different mode shapes that the natural 
frequency is affected or decreased due to the addition of pulley and flywheel. So the resonance condition is more 
critical for the combined assembly. The Vonmises stress plot concludes that during maximum rpm or maximum 
torque condition failure will take place near the fillet area. 
 
X.  FUTURE SCOPE 
 
1. As we calculated an, and bn values, further it is possible to do harmonic analysis and optimize the crankshaft again for 
dynamic conditions. 
2. It is prove that the meshed model and simulated boundary conditions are accurate hence mashed model can be used for 
type of other analysis like thermal loading, fatigue analysis, mechanism analysis etc. 
3. Variation of cylinder pressure as a function of engine rpm can be included and their effect on     the induced stresses can 
be studied.
