32.1 Introduction
As the name implies, the internal combustion engines
(briefly written as I. C. engines) are those engines in which
the combustion of fuel takes place inside the engine cylinder.
The I.C. engines use either petrol or diesel as their fuel. In
petrol engines (also called spark ignition engines or S.I
engines), the correct proportion of air and petrol is mixed
in the carburettor and fed to engine cylinder where it is
ignited by means of a spark produced at the spark plug. In
diesel engines (also called compression ignition engines
or C.I engines), only air is supplied to the engine cylinder
during suction stroke and it is compressed to a very high
pressure, thereby raising its temperature from 600°C to
1000°C. The desired quantity of fuel (diesel) is now injected
into the engine cylinder in the form of a very fine spray and
gets ignited when comes in contact with the hot air.
The operating cycle of an I.C. engine may be
completed either by the two strokes or four strokes of the

piston. Thus, an engine which requires two strokes of the piston or one complete revolution of the
crankshaft to complete the cycle, is known as two stroke engine. An engine which requires four
strokes of the piston or two complete revolutions of the crankshaft to complete the cycle, is known as
four stroke engine.
The two stroke petrol engines are generally employed in very light vehicles such as scooters,
motor cycles and three wheelers. The two stroke diesel engines are generally employed in marine
propulsion.
The four stroke petrol engines are generally employed in light vehicles such as cars, jeeps and
also in aeroplanes. The four stroke diesel engines are generally employed in heavy duty vehicles such
as buses, trucks, tractors, diesel locomotive and in the earth moving machinery.
32.2 Principal Parts of an Engine
The principal parts of an I.C engine, as shown in Fig. 32.1 are as follows :
1. Cylinder and cylinder liner, 2. Piston, piston rings and piston pin or gudgeon pin, 3. Connecting
rod with small and big end bearing, 4. Crank, crankshaft and crank pin, and 5. Valve gear mechanism.
The design of the above mentioned principal parts are discussed, in detail, in the following
pages.
Fig. 32.1. Internal combustion engine parts.
32.3 Cylinder and Cylinder Liner
The function of a cylinder is to retain the working fluid and to guide the piston. The cylinders
are usually made of cast iron or cast steel. Since the cylinder has to withstand high temperature due to
the combustion of fuel, therefore, some arrangement must be provided to cool the cylinder. The
single cylinder engines (such as scooters and motorcycles) are generally air cooled. They are provided
with fins around the cylinder. The multi-cylinder engines (such as of cars) are provided with water
jackets around the cylinders to cool it. In smaller engines. the cylinder, water jacket and the frame are

made as one piece, but for all the larger engines, these parts are manufactured separately. The cylinders
are provided with cylinder liners so that in case of wear, they can be easily replaced. The cylinder
liners are of the following two types :
1. Dry liner, and  2. Wet liner.
Fig. 32.2. Dry and wet liner.
A cylinder liner which does not have any direct contact with the engine cooling water, is known
as dry liner, as shown in Fig. 32.2 (a). A cylinder liner which have its outer surface in direct contact
with the engine cooling water, is known as wet liner, as shown in Fig. 32.2 (b).
The cylinder liners are made from good quality close grained cast iron (i.e. pearlitic cast iron),
nickel cast iron, nickel chromium cast iron. In some cases, nickel chromium cast steel with molybdenum
may be used. The inner surface of the liner should be properly heat-treated in order to obtain a hard
surface to reduce wear.
32.4 Design of a Cylinder
In designing a cylinder for an I. C. engine, it is required to determine the following values :
1. Thickness of the cylinder wall. The cylinder wall is subjected to gas pressure and the piston
side thrust. The gas pressure produces the following two types of stresses :
(a) Longitudinal stress, and (b) Circumferential stress.
The above picture shows crankshaft, pistons  and cylinder of a 4-stroke petrol engine.

Since these two stressess act at right angles to each other, therefore, the net stress in each
direction is reduced.
The piston side thrust tends to bend the cylinder wall, but the stress in the wall due to side thrust
is very small and hence it may be neglected.
Let
D0 = Outside diameter of the cylinder in mm,
D = Inside diameter of the cylinder in mm,
p = Maximum pressure inside the engine cylinder in N/mm2,
t = Thickness of the cylinder wall in mm, and
1/m = Poisson’s ratio. It is usually taken as 0.25.

The thickness of the cylinder wall usually varies from 4.5 mm to 25 mm or more depending
upon the size of the cylinder. The thickness of the cylinder wall (t) may also be obtained from the
following empirical relation, i.e.
t = 0.045 D + 1.6 mm
The other empirical relations are as follows :
Thickness of the dry liner

smaller cylinders
Water space between the outer cylinder wall and inner jacket wall
= 10 mm for a 75 mm cylinder to 75 mm for a 750 mm cylinder
or  0.08 D +  6.5 mm
2. Bore and length of the cylinder. The bore (i.e. inner diameter) and length of the cylinder may
be determined as discussed below :
Let
pm = Indicated mean effective pressure in N/mm2,
D = Cylinder bore in mm,
A = Cross-sectional area of the cylinder in mm2,
= π D2/4
l = Length of stroke in metres,
N = Speed of the engine in r.p.m., and
n = Number of working strokes per min

= N/2, for four stroke engine.

From this expression, the bore (D) and length of stroke (l) is determined. The length of stroke is
generally taken as 1.25 D to 2D.
Since there is a clearance on both sides of the cylinder, therefore length of the cylinder is taken
as 15 percent greater than the length of stroke. In other words,
Length of the cylinder, L = 1.15 × Length of stroke = 1.15 l

(b) The maximum gas pressure ( p ) may be taken as 9 to 10 times the mean effective pressure ( pm).
3. Cylinder flange and studs. The cylinders are cast integral with the upper half of the crank-
case or they are attached to the crankcase by means of a flange with studs or bolts and nuts. The
cylinder flange is integral with the cylinder and should be made thicker than the cylinder wall. The
flange thickness should be taken as 1.2 t to 1.4 t, where t is the thickness of cylinder wall.
The diameter of the studs or bolts may be obtained by equating the gas load due to the maximum
pressure in the cylinder to the resisting force offered by all the studs or bolts. Mathematically,

= Allowable tensile stress for the material of studs or bolts in MPa or
N/mm2. It may be taken as 35 to 70 MPa.
The nominal or major diameter of the stud or bolt (d ) usually lies between 0.75 tf  to  tf, where
tf is the thickness of flange. In no case, a stud or bolt less than 16 mm diameter should be used.
The distance of the flange from the centre of the hole for the stud or bolt should not be less than
d + 6 mm and not more than 1.5 d, where d is the nominal diameter of the stud or bolt.
In order to make a leak  proof  joint, the pitch of the studs or bolts should lie between 19 d  to
28.5

d  where d is in mm.
4. Cylinder head. Usually, a separate cylinder head or cover is provided with most of the engines.
It is, usually, made of box type section of considerable depth to accommodate ports for air and gas
passages, inlet valve, exhaust valve and spark plug (in case of petrol engines) or atomiser at the centre
of the cover (in case of diesel engines).
 The cylinder head may be approximately taken as a flat circular plate whose thickness (th) may
be determined from the following relation :
th =

p = Maximum pressure inside the cylinder in N/mm2,
c
σ
= Allowable circumferential stress in MPa or N/mm2. It may be taken
as 30 to 50 MPa, and
C = Constant whose value is taken as 0.1.
The studs or bolts are screwed up tightly alongwith a metal gasket or asbestos packing to provide
a leak proof joint between the cylinder and cylinder head. The tightness of the joint also depends
upon the pitch of the bolts or studs, which should lie between 19 d  to 28.5
.
d  The pitch circle
diameter (Dp) is usually taken as D + 3d. The studs or bolts are designed in the same way as discussed
above.
Example 32.1. A four stroke diesel engine has the following specifications :
Brake power = 5 kW ; Speed = 1200 r.p.m. ; Indicated mean effective pressure = 0.35 N / mm 2 ;
Mechanical efficiency = 80 %.

studs for the cylinder head.

2. Thickness of the cylinder head

32.5 Piston
The piston is a disc which reciprocates within a cylinder. It is either moved by the fluid or it
moves the fluid which enters the cylinder. The main function of the piston of an  internal combustion
engine is to receive the impulse from the expanding gas and to transmit the energy to the crankshaft
through the connecting rod. The piston must also disperse a large amount of heat from the combustion
chamber to the cylinder walls.

Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1133
The piston of internal combustion engines are usually of trunk type as shown in Fig. 32.3. Such
pistons are open at one end and consists of the following parts :
1. Head or crown. The piston head or crown may be flat, convex or concave depending upon
the design of combustion chamber. It withstands the pressure of gas in the cylinder.
2. Piston rings. The piston rings are used to seal the cyliner in order to prevent leakage of the
gas past the piston.
3. Skirt. The skirt acts as a bearing for the side thrust of the connecting rod on the walls of
cylinder.
4. Piston pin. It is also called gudgeon pin or wrist pin. It is used to connect the piston to the
connecting rod.
32.6 Design Considerations  for a Piston
In designing a piston for I.C. engine, the following points should be taken into consideration :
1. It should have enormous strength to withstand the high gas pressure and inertia forces.
2. It should have minimum mass to minimise the inertia forces.
3. It should form an effective gas and oil sealing of the cylinder.
4. It should provide sufficient   bearing area to prevent undue wear.
5. It should disprese the heat of combustion quickly to the cylinder walls.
6. It should have high speed reciprocation without noise.
7. It should be of sufficient rigid construction to withstand  thermal and mechanical distortion.
8. It should have sufficient support for the piston pin.
32.7 Material for Pistons
The most commonly used materials for pistons of I.C. engines are cast iron, cast aluminium,
forged aluminium, cast steel and forged steel. The cast iron pistons are used for moderately rated
Twin cylinder airplane engine of 1930s.

engines with piston speeds below 6 m / s and aluminium alloy pistons are used for highly rated en-
gines running at higher  piston sppeds. It may be noted that
1. Since the *coefficient of thermal expansion for aluminium is about 2.5 times that of cast iron,
therefore, a greater clearance must be provided between the piston and the cylinder wall (than with
cast iron piston) in order to prevent siezing of the piston when engine runs continuously under heavy
loads. But if excessive clearance is allowed, then the piston will develop ‘piston slap’ while it is cold
and this tendency increases with wear. The less clearance between the piston and the cylinder wall
will lead to siezing of piston.
2. Since the aluminium alloys used for pistons have high **heat conductivity (nearly four
times that of cast iron), therefore, these pistons ensure high rate of heat transfer and thus keeps
down the maximum temperature difference between the centre and edges of the piston head or
crown.
Notes: (a) For a cast iron piston, the temperature at the centre of the piston head (TC) is about 425°C to 450°C
under full load conditions and the temperature at the edges of the piston head (TE) is about 200°C to 225°C.
(b) For aluminium alloy pistons, TC is about 260°C to 290°C and  TE is about 185°C to 215°C.
3. Since the aluminium alloys are about ***three times lighter than cast iron, therfore, its
mechanical strength is good at low temperatures, but they lose their strength (about 50%) at temperatures
above  325°C. Sometimes, the pistons of aluminium alloys are coated with aluminium oxide by an
electrical method.
32.8 Piston Head or Crown
The piston head or crown is designed keeping in view the following two main considerations, i.e.
1. It should have adequate strength  to withstand the straining action due to pressure of explosion
inside the engine cylinder, and
2. It should dissipate the heat of combustion to the cylinder walls as quickly as possible.
On the basis of first consideration of straining action, the thickness of the piston head is determined
by treating it as a flat circular plate of uniform thickness, fixed at the outer edges and subjected to a
uniformly distributed load due to the gas pressure over the entire cross-section.
The thickness of the piston head (tH ), according to Grashoff’s formula is given by
tH =

where
p = Maximum gas pressure or explosion pressure in N/mm2,
D = Cylinder bore or outside diameter of the piston in mm, and
σt = Permissible bending (tensile) stress for the material of the piston in
MPa or N/mm2. It may be taken as 35 to 40 MPa for grey cast iron,
50 to 90 MPa for nickel cast iron and aluminium alloy and 60 to
100 MPa for forged steel.
On the basis of second consideration of heat transfer, the thickness of the piston head should be
such that the heat absorbed by the piston due combustion of fuel is quickly transferred to the cylinder
walls. Treating the piston head as a  flat ciucular plate, its thickness is given by

where
H = Heat flowing through the piston head in kJ/s or watts,
k = Heat conductivity factor in W/m/°C. Its value is 46.6 W/m/°C for
grey cast iron, 51.25 W/m/°C for steel and 174.75 W/m/°C for
aluminium alloys.
TC = Temperture at the centre of the piston head in °C, and
TE = Temperature at the edges of the piston head in °C.
The temperature difference (TC – TE)  may be taken as 220°C for cast iron and 75°C for aluminium.
The heat flowing through the positon head (H) may be deternined by the following expression, i.e.,
H = C × HCV × m × B.P. (in kW)
where
C = Constant representing that portion of the heat supplied to the engine
which is absorbed by the piston. Its value is usually taken
as 0.05.
HCV = Higher calorific value of the fuel in kJ/kg. It may be taken as
45 × 103 kJ/kg for diesel and 47 × 103 kJ/ kg for petrol,
m = Mass of the fuel used in kg per brake power per second, and
B.P. = Brake power of the engine per cylinder
Notes : 1. The thickness of the piston head (tH) is calculated by using equations (i) and (ii) and larger of the two
values obtained should be adopted.
2. When tH is 6 mm or less, then no ribs are required to strengthen the piston head against gas loads. But
when tH is greater then 6 mm, then a suitable number of ribs at the centre line of the boss extending around the
skirt should be provided to distribute the side thrust from the connecting rod and thus to prevent distortion of the
skirt. The thickness of the ribs may be takes as tH / 3 to tH / 2.
3. For engines having length of stroke to cylinder bore (L / D) ratio upto 1.5, a cup is provided in the top
of the piston head with a radius equal to 0.7 D. This is done to provide a space for combustion chamber.
32.9 Piston Rings
The piston rings are used to impart the necessary radial pressure to maintain the seal between
the piston and the cylinder bore. These are usually made of grey cast iron or alloy cast iron because of
their good wearing properties and also they retain spring characteristics even at high temperatures.
The piston rings are of the following two types :
1. Compression rings or pressure rings, and
2. Oil control rings or oil scraper.
The compression rings or pressure rings are inserted in the grooves at the top portion of the
piston and may be three to seven in number. These rings also transfer heat from the piston to the
cylinder liner and absorb some part of the piston fluctuation due to the side thrust.
The oil control rings or oil scrapers are provided below the compression rings. These rings
provide proper lubrication to the liner by allowing sufficient oil to move up during upward stroke and
at the same time scraps the lubricating oil from the surface of the liner in order to minimise the flow
of the oil to the combustion chamber.
The compression rings are usually made of rectangular cross-section and the diameter of the
ring is slightly larger than the cylinder bore. A part of the ring is cut- off in order to permit it to go into
the cylinder against the liner wall. The diagonal cut or step cut ends, as shown in Fig. 32.4 (a) and (b)
respectively, may be used. The gap between the ends should be sufficiently large when the ring is put
cold so that even at the highest temperature, the ends do not touch each other when the ring expands,
otherwise there might be buckling of the ring.

The radial thickness (t1) of the ring may be obtained by considering the radial pressure between
the cylinder wall and the ring. From bending stress consideration in the ring, the radial thickness is
given by
t1 =

σ
where
D = Cylinder bore in mm,
pw = Pressure of gas on the cylinder wall in N/mm2. Its value is limited
from 0.025 N/mm2 to 0.042 N/mm2, and
σt = Allowable bending (tensile) stress in MPa. Its value may be taken
from 85 MPa to 110 MPa for cast iron rings.
The axial thickness (t2 ) of the rings may be taken as 0.7 t1 to t1.
The minimum axial thickness (t2 ) may also be obtained from the following empirical relation:
t2 = 10
R
D
n
where
nR = Number of rings.
The width of the top land (i.e. the distance from the top of the piston to the first ring groove) is
made larger than other ring lands to protect the top ring from high temperature conditions existing at
the top of the piston,
∴Width of top land,
b1 = tH to 1.2 tH
The width of other ring lands (i.e. the distance between the ring grooves) in the piston may be
made equal to or slightly less than the axial thickness of the ring (t2).
∴ Width of other ring lands,
b2 = 0.75 t2  to  t2
The depth of the ring grooves should be more than the depth of the ring so that the ring does not
take any piston side thrust.
The gap between the free ends of the ring is given by 3.5 t1 to 4 t1. The gap, when the ring is in
the cylinder, should be 0.002 D to 0.004 D.
32.10 Piston Barrel
It is a cylindrical portion of the piston. The maximum thickness (t3) of the piston barrel may be
obtained from the following empirical relation :
t3 = 0.03 D + b + 4.5 mm
Contents
Top
Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1137
where
b = Radial depth of piston ring groove which is taken as 0.4 mm larger
than the radial thickness of the piston ring (t1)
= t1 + 0.4 mm
Thus, the above relation may be written as
t3 = 0.03 D + t1 + 4.9 mm
The piston wall thickness (t4) towards the open end is decreased and should be taken as 0.25 t3
to 0.35 t3.
32.11 Piston Skirt
The portion of the piston below the ring section is known as piston skirt. In acts as a bearing for
the side thrust of the connecting rod. The length of the piston skirt should be such that the bearing
pressure on the piston barrel due to the side thrust does not exceed 0.25 N/mm2 of the projected area
for low speed engines and 0.5 N/mm2 for high speed engines. It may be noted that the maximum
thrust will be during the expansion stroke. The side thrust (R) on the cylinder liner is usually taken as
1/10 of the maximum gas load on the piston.

From equations (i) and (ii), the length of the piston skirt (l) is determined. In actual practice, the
length of the piston skirt is taken as 0.65 to 0.8 times the cylinder bore. Now the total length of the
piston (L) is given by
L = Length of skirt + Length of ring section + Top land
The length of the piston usually varies between D and 1.5 D. It may be noted that a longer piston
provides better bearing surface for quiet running of the engine, but it should not be made unnecessarily
long as it will increase its own mass and thus the inertia
forces.
32.12 Piston Pin
The piston pin (also called gudgeon pin or wrist pin)
is used to connect the piston and the connecting rod. It is
usually made hollow and tapered on the inside, the smallest
inside diameter being at the centre of the pin, as shown in Fig. 32.5. The piston pin passes through the
bosses provided on the inside of the piston skirt and the bush of the small end  of the connecting rod.
The centre of piston pin should be 0.02 D  to  0.04 D above the centre of the skirt, in order to off-set
the turning effect of the friction and to obtain uniform distribution of pressure between the piston and
the cylinder liner.
The material used for the piston pin is usually case hardened steel alloy containing nickel,
chromium, molybdenum or vanadium having tensile strength from 710 MPa to 910 MPa.
Fig. 32.6. Full floating type piston pin.
The connection between the piston pin and the small end of the connecting rod may be made
either full floating type or semi-floating type. In the full floating type, the piston pin is free to turn
both in the *piston bosses and the bush of the small end of the connecting rod. The end movements of
the piston pin should be secured by means of spring circlips, as shown in Fig. 32.6, in order to prevent
the pin from touching and scoring the cylinder liner.
In the semi-floating type, the piston pin is either free to turn in the piston bosses and rigidly
secured to the small end of the connecting rod, or it is free to turn in the bush of the small end of
the connecting rod and is rigidly secured in the piston bosses by means of a screw, as shown in
Fig. 32.7
The piston pin should be designed for the maximum gas load or the inertia force of the piston,
whichever is larger. The bearing area of the piston pin should be about equally divided between the
piston pin bosses and the connecting rod bushing. Thus, the length of the pin in the connecting rod
bushing will be about 0.45 of the cylinder bore or piston diameter (D), allowing for the end clearance
Fig.32.5. Piston pin.
*
The mean diameter of the piston bosses is made 1.4 d0 for cast iron pistons and 1.5 d0 for aluminium
pistons, where d0 is the outside diameter of the piston pin. The piston bosses are usually tapered, increasing
the diameter towards the piston wall.

of the pin etc. The outside diameter of the piston pin (d0 ) is determined by equating the load on the
piston due to gas pressure (p) and the load on the piston pin due to bearing pressure ( pb1 ) at the small
end of the connecting rod bushing.

Example 32.2. Design a cast iron piston for a single acting four stroke engine for the following
data:
Cylinder bore = 100 mm ; Stroke = 125 mm ; Maximum gas pressure = 5 N/mm2 ; Indicated
mean effective pressure = 0.75 N/mm2 ; Mechanical efficiency = 80% ; Fuel consumption = 0.15 kg
per brake power per hour ; Higher calorific value of fuel = 42 × 103 kJ/kg ; Speed = 2000 r.p.m.
Any other data required for the design may be assumed.
Solution. Given : D = 100 mm ; L = 125 mm = 0.125 m ; p = 5 N/mm2 ; pm = 0.75 N/mm2;
m
η  = 80% = 0.8 ; m = 0.15 kg / BP / h = 41.7 × 10–6 kg / BP / s; HCV = 42 × 103 kJ / kg ;
N = 2000 r.p.m.
The dimensions for various components of the piston are determined as follows :
1. Piston head or crown
The thickness of the piston head or crown is determined on the basis of strength as well as on the
basis of heat dissipation and the larger of the two values is adopted.

Since the ratio of L / D is 1.25, therefore a cup in the top of the piston head with a radius equal

2. Radial ribs
The radial ribs may be four in number. The thickness of the ribs varies from tH / 3 to tH / 2.

Let us adopt
b1 = 18 mm ; and b2 = 2.5 mm Ans.
We know that the gap between the free ends of the ring,
G1 = 3.5 t1 to 4 t1 = 3.5 × 3.4 to 4 × 3.4 mm = 11.9 to 13.6 mm

Let us adopt                G1 = 12.8 mm ; and G2 = 0.3 mm Ans.
4. Piston barrel
Since the radial depth of the piston ring grooves (b) is about 0.4 mm more than the radial
thickness of the piston rings  (t1), therefore,
b = t1 + 0.4 = 3.4 + 0.4 = 3.8 mm
We know that the maximum thickness of barrel,
t3 = 0.03 D + b + 4.5 mm = 0.03 × 100 + 3.8 + 4.5 = 11.3 mm
and piston wall thickness towards the open end,
t4 = 0.25 t3 to 0.35 t3 = 0.25 × 11.3 to 0.35 × 11.3 = 2.8 to 3.9 mm

From above, we find that
45 l = 3928 or  l = 3928 / 45 = 87.3 say 90 mm Ans.
∴

∴ Total length of the piston ,

32.13 Connecting Rod
The connecting rod is the intermediate member between the piston and the crankshaft. Its primary
function is to transmit the push and pull from the piston pin to the crankpin and thus convert the
reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotary motion of the crank. The usual form of the connecting
rod in internal combustion engines is shown in Fig. 32.9. It consists of a long shank, a small end and a
big end. The cross-section of the shank may be rectangular, circular, tubular, I-section or H-section.
Generally circular section is used for low speed engines while I-section is preferred for high speed engines.
Fig. 32.9. Connecting rod.
The *length of the connecting rod ( l ) depends upon the ratio of l / r, where r is the radius of
crank. It may be noted that the smaller length will decrease the ratio l / r. This increases the angularity
of the connecting rod which increases the side thrust of the piston against the cylinder liner which in
turn increases the wear of the liner. The larger length of the connecting rod will increase the ratio
l / r. This decreases the angularity of the connecting rod and thus decreases the side thrust and the
resulting wear of the cylinder. But the larger length of the connecting rod increases the overall height
of the engine. Hence, a compromise is made and the ratio l / r is generally kept as 4 to 5.
The small end of the connecting rod is usually made in the form of an eye and is provided with
a bush of phosphor bronze. It is connected to the piston by means of a piston pin.
The big end of the connecting rod is usually made split (in two **halves) so that it can be
mounted easily on the crankpin bearing shells. The split cap is fastened to the big end with two cap
bolts. The bearing shells of the big end are made of steel, brass or bronze with a thin lining (about
0.75 mm) of white metal or babbit metal. The wear of the big end bearing is allowed for by inserting
thin metallic strips (known as shims) about 0.04 mm thick between the cap and the fixed half of the
connecting rod. As the wear takes place, one or more strips are removed and the bearing is trued up.
*
It is the distance between the centres of small end and big end of the connecting rod.
**
One half is fixed with the connecting rod and the other half (known as cap) is fastened with two cap bolts.

Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1145
The connecting rods are usually manufactured by drop forging process and it should have adequate
strength, stiffness and minimum weight. The material mostly used for connecting rods varies from
mild carbon steels (having 0.35 to 0.45 percent carbon) to alloy steels (chrome-nickel or chrome-
molybdenum steels). The carbon steel having 0.35 percent carbon has an ultimate tensile strength of
about 650 MPa when properly heat treated and a carbon steel with 0.45 percent carbon has a ultimate
tensile strength of 750 MPa. These steels are used for connecting rods of industrial engines. The alloy
steels have an ultimate tensile strength of about 1050 MPa and are used for connecting rods of
aeroengines and automobile engines.
The bearings at the two ends of the connecting rod are either splash lubricated or pressure
lubricated. The big end bearing is usually splash lubricated while the small end bearing is pressure
lubricated. In the splash lubrication system, the cap at the big end is provided with a dipper or spout
and set at an angle in such a way that when the connecting rod moves downward, the spout will dip
into the lubricating oil contained in the sump. The oil is forced up the spout and then to the big end
bearing. Now when the connecting rod moves upward, a splash of oil is produced by the spout. This
splashed up lubricant find its way into the small end bearing through the widely chamfered holes
provided on the upper surface of the small end.
In the pressure lubricating system, the lubricating oil is fed under pressure to the big end bearing
through the holes drilled in crankshaft, crankwebs and crank pin. From the big end bearing, the oil is fed to
small end bearing through a fine hole drilled in the shank of the connecting rod. In some cases, the small
end bearing is lubricated by the oil scrapped from the walls of the cyinder liner by the oil scraper rings.
32.14 Forces Acting on the Connecting Rod
The various forces acting on the connecting rod are as follows :
1. Force on the piston due to gas pressure and inertia of the reciprocating parts,
2. Force due to inertia of the connecting rod or inertia bending forces,
3. Force due to friction of the piston rings and of the piston, and
4. Force due to friction of the piston pin bearing and the crankpin bearing.
We shall now derive the expressions for the forces acting on a vertical engine, as discussed below.
1. Force on the piston due to gas pressure and inertia of reciprocating parts
Consider a connecting rod PC as shown in Fig. 32.10.

It may be noted that the inertia force of reciprocating parts opposes the force on the piston when
it moves during its downward stroke (i. e. when the piston moves from the top dead centre to bottom
dead centre). On the other hand, the inertia force of the reciprocating parts helps the force on the
piston when it moves from the bottom dead centre to top dead centre.

The force FP gives rise to a force FC in the connecting rod and a thrust FN on the sides of the

The force in the connecting rod will be maximum when the crank and the connecting rod are
perpendicular to each other (i.e. when θ = 90°). But at this position, the gas pressure would be de-
creased considerably. Thus, for all practical purposes, the force in the connecting rod (FC) is taken
equal to the maximum force on the piston due to pressure of gas (FL), neglecting piston inertia
effects.
2. Force due to inertia of the connecting rod or inertia bending forces
Consider a connecting rod PC and a crank OC rotating with uniform angular velocity ω rad / s.
In order to find the accleration of various points on the connecting rod, draw the Klien’s acceleration
diagram CQNO as shown in Fig. 32.11 (a). CO represents the acceleration of C towards O and NO
represents the accleration of P towards O. The acceleration of other points such as D, E, F and G etc.,
on the connecting rod PC may be found by drawing horizontal lines from these points to intresect CN
at d, e, f, and g respectively. Now dO, eO, fO and gO respresents the acceleration of D, E, F and G all
towards O. The inertia force acting on each point will be as follows:
      Inertia force at   C = m × ω2 × CO
Inertia force at D = m × ω2 × dO
Inertia force at E = m × ω2 × eO, and so on.
Fig. 32.11. Inertia bending forces.
The inertia forces will be opposite to the direction of acceleration or centrifugal forces. The
inertia forces can be resolved into two components, one parallel to the connecting rod and the other
perpendicular to rod. The parallel (or longitudinal) components adds up algebraically to the force

acting on the connecting rod (FC) and produces thrust on the pins. The perpendicular (or transverse)
components produces bending action (also called whipping action) and the stress induced in the
connecting rod is called whipping stress.
It may be noted that the perpendicular components will be maximum, when the crank and
connecting rod are at right angles to each other.
The variation of the inertia force on the connecting rod is linear and is like a simply supported
beam of variable loading as shown in Fig. 32.11 (b) and (c). Assuming that the connecting rod is of
uniform cross-section and has mass m1 kg per unit length, therefore,
Inertia force per unit length at the crankpin
= m1 × ω2 r
and inertia force per unit length at the piston pin
= 0

where
Z = Section modulus.
From above we see that the maximum bending moment varies as the square of speed, therefore,
the bending stress due to high speed will be dangerous. It may be noted that the maximum axial force
and the maximum bending stress do not occur simultaneously. In an I.C. engine, the maximum gas
load occurs close to top dead centre whereas the maximum bending stress occurs when the crank
angle θ = 65° to 70° from top dead centre. The pressure of gas falls suddenly as the piston moves from
dead centre. Thus the general practice is to design a connecting rod by assuming the force in the
connecting rod (FC) equal to the maximum force due to pressure (FL), neglecting piston inertia
effects and then checked for bending stress due to inertia force (i.e. whipping stress).
3. Force due to friction of piston rings and of the piston
The frictional force ( F ) of the piston rings may be determined by using the following expression

nR = Number of rings,
pR = Pressure of rings (0.025 to 0.04 N/mm2), and
μ = Coefficient of friction (about 0.1).
Since the frictional force of the piston rings is usually very small, therefore, it may be
neglected.
The friction of the piston is produced by the normal component of the piston pressure which
varies from 3 to 10 percent of the piston pressure. If the coefficient of friction is about 0.05 to 0.06,
then the frictional force due to piston will be about 0.5 to 0.6 of the piston pressure, which is very low.
Thus, the frictional force due to piston is also neglected.
4. Force due to friction of the piston pin bearing and crankpin bearing
The force due to friction of the piston pin bearing and crankpin bearing, is to bend the connecting
rod and to increase the compressive stress on the connecting rod due to the direct load. Thus, the
maximum compressive stress in the connecting rod will be
σc (max) = Direct compressive stress + Maximum bending or whipping stress
due to inertia bending stress
32.15 Design of Connecting Rod
In designing a connecting rod, the following dimensions are required to be determined :
1. Dimensions of cross-section of the connecting rod,
2. Dimensions of the crankpin at the big end and the piston pin at the small end,
3. Size of bolts for securing the big end cap, and
4. Thickness of the big end cap.
The procedure adopted in determining the above mentioned dimensions is discussed as below :

1. Dimensions of cross-section of the connecting rod
A connecting rod is a machine member which is subjected to alternating direct compressive and
tensile forces. Since the compressive forces are much higher than the tensile forces, therefore, the
cross-section of the connecting rod is designed as a strut and the Rankine’s formula is used.
A connecting rod, as shown in Fig. 32.12, subjected to an axial load W may buckle with X-axis
as neutral axis (i.e. in the plane of motion of the connecting rod) or Y-axis as neutral axis (i.e. in the
plane perpendicular to the plane of motion). The connecting rod is considered like both ends hinged
for buckling about X-axis and both ends fixed for buckling about Y-axis.
A connecting rod should be equally strong in buckling about both the axes.
Let
A = Cross-sectional area of the connecting rod,
l = Length of the connecting rod,
σc = Compressive yield stress,
WB = Buckling load,
Ixx and Iyy = Moment of inertia of the section about X-axis and Y-axis
respectively, and
kxx and kyy = Radius of gyration of the section about X-axis and Y-axis
respectively.

This shows that the connecting rod is four times
strong in buckling about Y-axis than about X-axis. If
Ixx > 4 Iyy, then buckling will occur about Y- axis and
if Ixx < 4 Iyy, buckling will occur about X-axis. In
actual practice, Ixx is kept slightly less than  4 Iyy. It
is usually taken between 3 and 3.5 and the connecting
rod is designed for bucking about X-axis. The design
will always be satisfactory for buckling about Y-axis.
The most suitable section for the connecting
rod is I-section with the proportions as shown in
Fig. 32.13 (a).
Let thickness of the flange and web of the
section = t
Width of the section,     B = 4 t
and depth or height of the section,
                                H = 5t

After deciding the proportions for I-section of the connecting rod, its dimensions are determined

Notes : (a) The I-section of the connecting rod is used due to its lightness and to keep the inertia forces as low
as possible specially in case of high speed engines. It can also withstand high gas pressure.
(b) Sometimes a connecting rod may have rectangular section. For slow speed engines, circular section
may be used.
(c) Since connecting rod is manufactured by forging, therefore the sharp corner of I-section are rounded
off as shown in Fig. 32.13 (b) for easy removal of the section from dies.

The dimensions B = 4 t and  H = 5 t, as obtained above by applying the Rankine’s formula,
are at the middle of the connecting rod. The width of the section (B) is kept constant throughout the
length of the connecting rod, but the depth or height varies. The depth near the small end (or piston
end) is taken as H1 = 0.75 H to 0.9H and the depth near the big end (or crank end) is taken
H2 = 1.1H to 1.25H.
2. Dimensions of the crankpin at the big end and the piston pin at the small end
Since the dimensions of the crankpin at the big end and the piston pin (also known as gudgeon
pin or wrist pin) at the small end are limited, therefore, fairly high bearing pressures have to be
allowed at the bearings of these two pins.
The crankpin at the big end
has removable precision bearing
shells of brass or bronze or steel
with a thin lining (1 mm or less)
of bearing metal (such as tin, lead,
babbit, copper, lead) on the inner
surface of the shell. The allowable
bearing pressure on the crankpin
depends upon many factors such
as material of the bearing,
viscosity of the lubricating oil,
method of lubrication and the
space limitations.The value of
bearing pressure may be taken
as 7 N/mm2 to 12.5 N/mm2
depending upon the material and
method of lubrication used.
The piston pin bearing is usually a phosphor bronze bush of about 3 mm thickness and the
allowable bearing pressure may be taken as 10.5 N/mm2 to 15 N/mm2.
Since the maximum load to be carried by the crankpin and piston pin bearings is the maximum
force in the connecting rod (FC), therefore the dimensions for these two pins are determined for the
maximum force in the connecting rod (FC) which is taken equal to the maximum force on the piston
due to gas pressure (FL) neglecting the inertia forces.
We know that maximum gas force,
FL =

D

...(i)
where
D = Cylinder bore or piston diameter in mm, and
p = Maximum gas pressure in N/mm2
Now the dimensions of the crankpin and piston pin are determined as discussed below :
Let
dc = Diameter of the crank pin in mm,
lc = Length of the crank pin in mm,
pbc = Allowable bearing pressure in N/mm2, and
dp, lp  and pbp = Corresponding values for the piston pin,
We know that load on the crank pin
= Projected area × Bearing pressure
= dc . lc . pbc
...(ii)
Similarly, load on the piston pin
=  dp . lp . pbp
...(iii)

1154    A Textbook of Machine Design
Equating equations (i) and (ii), we have
FL =  dc · lc · pbc
Taking lc = 1.25 dc to 1.5 dc, the value of dc and lc are determined from the above expression.
Again, equating equations (i) and (iii), we have
FL = dp · lp · pbp
Taking lp = 1.5 dp to 2 dp, the value of dp and lp are determined from the above expression.
3. Size of bolts for securing the big end cap
The bolts and the big end cap are subjected to tensile force which corresponds to the inertia
force of the reciprocating parts at the top dead centre on the exhaust stroke. We know that inertia

repeated stresses but not alternating stresses, therefore, a factor of safety may be taken as 6.

supported at the cap bolt centres and loaded by the inertia force at the top dead centre on the exhaust
stroke (i.e. FI when θ = 0). This load is assumed to act in between the uniformly distributed load and
the centrally concentrated load. Therefore, the maximum bending moment acting on the cap will be
taken as

Note: The design of connecting rod should be checked for whipping stress (i.e. bending stress due to inertia
force on the connecting rod).
Example 32.3. Design a connecting rod for an I.C. engine running at 1800 r.p.m. and developing
a maximum pressure of 3.15 N/mm2. The diameter of the piston is 100 mm ; mass of the reciprocating
parts per cylinder 2.25 kg; length of connecting rod 380 mm; stroke of piston 190 mm and compression
ratio 6 : 1. Take a factor of safety of 6 for the design. Take length to diameter ratio for big end
bearing as 1.3 and small end bearing as 2 and the corresponding bearing pressures as 10 N/mm2
and 15 N/mm2. The density of material of the rod may be taken as 8000 kg/m3 and the allowable
stress in the bolts as 60 N/mm2 and in cap as 80 N/mm2. The rod is to be of I-section for which you
can choose your own proportions.
Draw a neat dimensioned sketch showing provision for lubrication. Use Rankine formula for
which the numerator constant may be taken as 320 N/mm2 and the denominator constant 1 / 7500.

The connecting rod is designed as discussed
below :
1. Dimension of I- section of the connecting rod
Let us consider an I-section of the connecting
rod, as shown in Fig. 32.14 (a), with the following
proportions :
Flange and web thickness of the section = t
Width of the section,    B = 4t
and depth or height of the section,
H = 5t
First of all, let us find whether the section
chosen is satisfactory or not.
We have already discussed that the connecting rod is considered like both ends hinged for
buckling about X-axis and both ends fixed for buckling about Y-axis. The connecting rod should be
equally strong in buckling about both the axes. We know that in order to have a connecting rod
equally strong about both the axes,
Ixx = 4 Iyy
where
Ixx = Moment of inertia of the section about X-axis, and
Iyy = Moment of inertia of the section about Y-axis.
In actual practice, Ixx is kept slightly less than 4 Iyy. It is usually taken between 3 and 3.5 and the
connecting rod is designed for buckling about X-axis.
Now, for the section as shown in Fig. 32.14 (a), area of the section,
A = 2 (4 t × t ) + 3t × t = 11 t2

We know that the connecting rod is designed for buckling about X-axis (i.e. in the plane of

therefore the buckling load,

These dimensions are at the middle of the connecting rod. The width (B) is kept constant through-
out the length of the rod, but the depth (H) varies. The depth near the big end or crank end is kept as 1.1H
to 1.25H and the depth near the small end or piston end is kept as 0.75H to 0.9H. Let us take
Depth near the big end,
H1 = 1.2H = 1.2 × 35 = 42 mm
and depth near the small end,
H2 = 0.85H = 0.85 × 35 = 29.75 say 30 mm
∴ Dimensions of the section near the big end
= 42 mm × 28 mm Ans.
and dimensions of the section near the small end
= 30 mm × 28 mm Ans.
Since the connecting rod is manufactured by forging, therefore the sharp corners of I-section
are rounded off, as shown in Fig. 32.14 (b), for easy removal of the section from the dies.
2. Dimensions of the crankpin or the big end bearing and piston pin or small end bearing
Let
dc = Diameter of the crankpin or big end bearing,
lc = length of the crankpin or big end bearing  = 1.3 dc
...(Given)
pbc = Bearing pressure = 10 N/mm2
...(Given)
We know that load on the crankpin or big end bearing
= Projected area × Bearing pressure
= dc .lc . pbc = dc × 1.3 dc × 10 = 13 (dc)2
Since the crankpin or the big end bearing is designed for the maximum gas force (FL), therefore,
equating the load on the crankpin or big end bearing to the maximum gas force, i.e.
13 (dc)2 = FL = 24 740 N
∴
(dc )2 = 24 740 / 13 = 1903   or   dc = 43.6 say 44 mm Ans.
and
lc = 1.3 dc = 1.3 × 44 = 57.2 say 58 mm Ans.
The big end has removable precision bearing shells of brass or bronze or steel with a thin lining
(1mm or less) of bearing metal such as babbit.
Again, let
dp = Diameter of the piston pin or small end bearing,
lp = Length of the piston pin or small end bearing  = 2dp
...(Given)
pbp = Bearing pressure = 15 N/mm2
..(Given)
We know that the load on the piston pin or small end bearing
= Project area × Bearing pressure
= dp . lp . pbp = dp × 2 dp × 15 = 30 (dp)2
Since the piston pin or the small end bearing is designed for the maximum gas force (FL),
therefore, equating the load on the piston pin or the small end bearing to the maximum gas force,
i.e.
30 (dp)2 = 24 740 N
∴
(dp)2 = 24 740 / 30 = 825   or   dp = 28.7 say 29 mm Ans.
and
lp = 2 dp = 2 × 29 = 58 mm Ans.
The small end bearing is usually a phosphor bronze bush of about 3 mm thickness.

We know that mass of the connecting rod per metre length,

32.16 Crankshaft
A crankshaft (i.e. a shaft with a crank) is used to convert reciprocating motion of the piston into
rotatory motion or vice versa. The crankshaft consists of the shaft parts which revolve in the main
bearings, the crankpins to which the big ends of the connecting rod are connected, the crank arms or
webs (also called cheeks) which connect the crankpins and the shaft parts. The crankshaft, depending
upon the position of crank, may be divided into the following two types :
1. Side crankshaft or overhung crankshaft, as shown in Fig. 32.15 (a), and
2. Centre crankshaft, as shown in Fig. 32. 15 (b).
Fig. 32.15. Types of crankshafts.
The crankshaft, depending upon the number of cranks in the shaft, may also be classfied as
single throw or multi-throw crankshafts. A crankhaft with only one side crank or centre crank is
called a single throw crankshaft whereas the crankshaft with two side cranks, one on each end or
with two or more centre cranks is known as multi-throw crankshaft.
The side crankshafts are used for medium and large size horizontal engines.
32.17 Material and manufacture of Crankshafts
The crankshafts are subjected to shock and fatigue loads. Thus material of the crankshaft should
be tough and fatigue resistant. The crankshafts are generally made of carbon steel, special steel or
special cast iron.
In industrial engines, the crankshafts are commonly made from carbon steel such as 40 C 8,
55 C 8 and 60 C 4. In transport engines, manganese steel such as 20 Mn 2, 27 Mn 2 and 37 Mn 2 are
generally used for the making of crankshaft. In aero engines, nickel chromium steel such as
35 Ni 1 Cr 60 and 40 Ni 2 Cr 1 Mo 28 are extensively used for the crankshaft.
The crankshafts are made by drop forging or casting process but the former method is more
common. The surface of the crankpin is hardened by case carburizing, nitriding or induction
hardening.
32.18 Bearing Pressures and Stresses in Crankshaft
The bearing pressures are very important in the design of crankshafts. The *maximum
permissible bearing pressure depends upon the maximum gas pressure, journal velocity, amount and
method of lubrication and change of direction of bearing pressure.
The following two types of stresses are induced in the crankshaft.
1.  Bending stress ; and 2. Shear stress due to torsional moment on the shaft.
*
The values of maximum permissible bearing pressures for different types of engines are given in
Chapter 26, Table 26.3.
Contents
Top
1162    A Textbook of Machine Design
Most crankshaft failures are caused by a progressive fracture due to repeated bending or reversed
torsional stresses. Thus the crankshaft is under fatigue loading and, therefore, its design should be
based upon endurance limit. Since the failure of a crankshaft is likely to cause a serious engine
destruction and neither all the forces nor all the stresses acting on the crankshaft can be determined
accurately, therefore a high factor of safety from 3 to 4, based on the endurance limit, is used.
The following table shows the allowable bending and shear stresses for some commonly used
materials for crankshafts :

32.19 Design Procedure for Crankshaft
The following procedure may be adopted for designing a crankshaft.
1. First of all, find the magnitude of the various loads on the crankshaft.
2. Determine the distances between the supports and their position with respect to the loads.
3. For the sake of simplicity and also for safety, the shaft is considered to be supported at the
centres of the bearings and all the forces and reactions to be acting at these points. The distances
between the supports depend on the length of the bearings, which in turn depend on the diameter of
the shaft because of the  allowable bearing pressures.
4. The thickness of the cheeks or webs is assumed to be from 0.4 ds to 0.6 ds, where ds is the
diameter of the shaft. It may also be taken as 0.22D to 0.32 D, where D is the bore of cylinder in mm.
5. Now calculate the distances between the supports.
6. Assuming the allowable bending and shear stresses, determine the main dimensions of the
crankshaft.
Notes: 1. The crankshaft must be designed or checked for at least two crank positions. Firstly, when the crank-
shaft is subjected to maximum bending moment and secondly when the crankshaft is subjected to maximum
twisting moment or torque.
2. The additional moment due to weight of flywheel, belt tension and other forces must be considered.
3. It is assumed that the effect of bending moment does not exceed two bearings between which a force is
considered.
32.20 Design of Centre Crankshaft
We shall design the centre crankshaft by considering the two crank possitions, i.e. when the
crank is at dead centre (or when the crankshaft is subjected to maximum bending moment) and when
the crank is at angle at which the twisting moment is maximum. These two cases are discussed in
detail as below :
1. When the crank is at dead centre. At this position of the crank, the maximum gas pressure on
the piston will transmit maximum force on the crankpin in the plane of the crank causing only bending
of the shaft. The crankpin as well as ends of the crankshaft will be only subjected to bending moment.
Thus, when the crank is at the dead centre, the bending moment on the shaft is maximum and the
twisting moment is zero.

2. When the crank is at an angle of maximum twisting moment
The twisting moment on the crankshaft will be maximum when the tangential force on the crank
(FT) is maximum. The maximum value of tangential force lies when the crank is at angle of 25° to 30º
from the dead centre for a constant volume combustion  engines  (i.e., petrol engines) and 30º to 40º
for constant pressure combustion engines (i.e., diesel engines).
Consider a position of the crank at an angle of maximum twisting moment as shown in Fig.
32.17 (a). If p′ is the intensity of pressure on the piston at this instant, then the piston gas load at this
position of crank,

and thrust on the connecting rod,
FQ =
P
cos
F
φ
where
φ = Angle of inclination of the connecting rod with the line of stroke
PO.
The *thrust in the connecting rod (FQ) may be divided into two components, one perpendicular
to the crank and the other along the crank. The component of FQ perpendicular to the crank is the
tangential force (FT) and the component of FQ along the crank is the radial force (FR) which produces
thrust on the crankshaft bearings. From Fig. 32.17 (b), we find that
Fig. 32.17. (a) Crank at an angle of maximum twisting moment. (b) Forces acting on the crank.
FT = FQ sin ( θ + φ  )
and
FR = FQ cos ( θ + φ  )
It may be noted that the tangential force will cause twisting of the crankpin and shaft while the
radial force will cause bending of the shaft.

32.21 Side or Overhung Crankshaft
The side or overhung crankshafts are used for medium size and large horizontal engines. Its
main advantage is that it requires only two bearings in either the single or two crank construction. The
design procedure for the side or overhung crankshaft is same as that for centre crankshaft. Let us now
design the side crankshaft by considering the two crank positions, i.e. when the crank is at dead centre
(or when the crankshaft is subjected to maximum bending moment) and when the crank is at an angle
at which the twisting moment is maximum. These two cases are discussed in detail as below:
1. When the crank is at dead centre. Consider a side crankshaft at dead centre with its loads
and distances of their application, as shown in Fig. 32.18.

The various parts of the side crankshaft, when the crank is at dead centre, are now designed as
discussed below:
(a) Design of crankpin. The dimensions of the crankpin are obtained by considering the crank-
pin in bearing and then checked for bending stress.
Let
dc = Diameter of the crankpin in mm,
lc = Length of the crankpin in mm, and
pb = Safe bearing pressure on the pin in N/mm2. It may be between
9.8 to 12.6 N/mm2.
We know that
FP = dc . lc . pb
From this expression, the values of dc and lc
may be obtained. The length of crankpin is usually
from 0.6 to 1.5 times the diameter of pin.
The crankpin is now checked for bending
stress. If it is assumed that the crankpin acts as a
cantilever and the load on the crankpin is uniformly
distributed, then maximum bending moment will
be 
P

. But in actual  practice, the bearing
pressure on the crankpin is not uniformly

of bending moment ranging between

M = FP (0.75 lc + t + 0.5 l1)
...(i)
where
lc = Length of the crankpin,
t = Thickness of the crank web = 0.45 dc to 0.75 dc, and

Note : The bearing 2 is also made of the same diameter. The length of the bearings are found on the basis of
allowable bearing pressures and the maximum reactions at the bearings.
(c) Design of crank web. When the crank is at dead centre, the crank web is subjected to a
bending moment and to a direct compressive stress.
We know that bending moment on the crank web,
M = FP (0.75 lc + 0.5 t)

be the resultant of horizontal bending moment due to the gas load and belt pull and the vertical
bending moment due to the flywheel weight.
Let
ds =  Diameter of shaft under the flywheel.

2. When the crank is at an angle of maximum twisting moment. Consider a position of the
crank at an angle of maximum twisting moment as shown in Fig. 32.19. We have already discussed in
the design of a centre crankshaft that the thrust in the connecting rod (FQ) gives rise to the tangential
force (FT) and the radial force (FR).
Fig. 32.19. Crank at an angle of maximum twisting moment.
Due to the tangential force (FT), there will be two reactions at the bearings 1 and 2, such that

Total belt pull = 6.5 kN.
When the crank has turned through 35° from the top dead centre, the pressure on the piston is
1N/mm2 and the torque on the crank is maximum. The ratio of the connecting rod length to the crank

Since this value of crankpin diameter (i.e. dc = 149 mm) is less than the already calculated value
of dc = 205 mm, therefore, we shall take dc = 205 mm. Ans.
(b)  Design of shaft under the flywheel
Let
ds = Diameter of the shaft in mm.
The resulting bending moment on the shaft will be same as calculated eariler, i.e.
MS = 10.08 × 106 N-mm

shear stress is more than the allowable shear stress of 31 to 42 MPa. Hence, the value of ds is
calculated by taking τ  = 35 MPa or N/mm2 in the above equation, i.e.

Since this bearing pressure is less than the safe limit of 5 to 8 N/mm2, therefore, the design is safe.
Example 32.5. Design a side or overhung crankshaft for a 250 mm × 300 mm gas engine. The
weight of the flywheel is 30 kN and the explosion pressure is 2.1 N/mm2. The gas pressure at the
maximum torque is 0.9 N/mm2, when the crank angle is 35° from I. D. C. The connecting rod is 4.5
times the crank radius.
Solution. Given : D = 250 mm ; L = 300 mm or r = L / 2 = 300 / 2  = 150 mm ; W = 30 kN
= 30 × 103 N ; p = 2.1 N/mm2, p′ = 0.9 N/mm2 ; l = 4.5 r or l / r = 4.5
We shall design the crankshaft for the
two positions of the crank, i.e. firstly when
the crank is at the dead centre and secondly
when the crank is at an angle of maximum
twisting moment.

at the dead centre (See Fig. 32.18)

Now the various parts of the crankshaft
are designed as discussed below:
(a)  Design of crankpin
Let
dc = Diameter of the crankpin in mm, and
lc = Length of the crankpin = 0.8 dc
...(Assume)
Considering the crankpin in bearing, we have
FP = dc.lc.pb
103 × 103 = dc × 0.8 dc × 10 = 8 (dc)2
...(Taking pb = 10 N/mm2)
∴
(dc)2 = 103 × 103 / 8 = 12 875 or dc = 113.4 say 115 mm
and
lc = 0.8 dc = 0.8 × 115 = 92 mm
Let us now check the induced bending stress in the crankpin.

32.22 Valve Gear Mechanism
The valve gear mechanism of an I.C. engine consists of those parts which actuate the inlet and
exhaust valves at the required time with respect to the position of piston and crankshaft.Fig .32.20 (a)
shows the valve gear arrangement for vertical engines. The main components of the mechanism are
valves, rocker arm, * valve springs, **push rod, ***cam and camshaft.
Fig. 32.20. Valve gear mechanism.
*
For the design of springs, refer Chapter 23.
**
For the design of push rod, refer Chapter 16 (Art. 16.14).
*** For the design of cams, refer to Authors’ popular book on ‘Theory of Machines’.
Contents
Top
1190    A Textbook of Machine Design
The fuel is admitted to the engine by the inlet valve and the burnt gases are escaped through the
exhaust valve. In vertical engines, the cam moving on the rotating camshaft pushes the cam follower
and push rod upwards, thereby transmitting the cam action to rocker arm. The camshaft is rotated by
the toothed belt from the crankshaft. The rocker arm is pivoted at its centre by a fulcrum pin. When
one end of the rocker arm is pushed up by the push rod, the other end moves downward. This pushes
down the valve stem causing the valve to move down, thereby opening the port. When the cam
follower moves over the circular portion of cam, the pushing action of the rocker arm on the valve is
released and the valve returns to its seat and closes it by the action of the valve spring.
In some of the modern engines, the camshaft is located at cylinder head level. In such cases, the
push rod is eliminated and the roller type cam follower is made part of the rocker arm. Such an
arrangement for the horizontal engines is shown in Fig. 32.20 (b).
32.23 Valves
The valves used in internal combustion engines are
of the following three types ;
1. Poppet or mushroom valve ; 2. Sleeve valve ;
3. Rotary valve.
Out of these three valves, poppet valve, as shown
in Fig. 32.21, is very frequently used. It consists of head,
face and stem. The head and face of the valve is sepa-
rated by a small margin, to aviod sharp edge of the valve
and also to provide provision for the regrinding of the
face. The face angle generally varies from 30° to 45°.
The lower part of the stem is provided with a groove in
which spring retainer lock is installed.
Since both the inlet and exhaust valves are subjected
to high temperatures of 1930°C to 2200°C during the
power stroke, therefore, it is necessary that the material
of the valves should withstand these temperatures. Thus
the material of the valves must have good heat conduction,
heat resistance, corrosion resistance, wear resistance and
shock resistance. It may be noted that the temperature at
the inlet valve is less as compared to exhaust valve. Thus,
the inlet valve is generally made of nickel chromium alloy
steel and the exhaust valve (which is subjected to very high
temperature of exhaust gases) is made from silchrome steel
which is a special alloy of silicon and chromium.
In designing a valve, it is required to determine the following dimensions:
(a)  Size of the valve port
Let
ap = Area of the port,
vp = Mean velocity of gas flowing through the port,
a = Area of the piston, and
v = Mean velocity of the piston.
We know that
ap.vp = a.v

Sometimes, inlet port is made 20 to 40 precent larger than exhaust port for better cylinder
charging.
(b)  Thickness of the valve disc
The thickness of the valve disc (t), as shown in Fig. 32.22, may be determined empirically from
the following relation, i.e.
t = k.dp 
b
p
σ
where
k = Constant = 0.42 for steel and 0.54 for cast iron,
dp = Diameter of the port in mm,
p = Maximum gas pressure in N/mm2, and
σb = Permissible bending stress in MPa or N/mm2
= 50 to 60 MPa for carbon steel and 100 to 120 MPa for alloy steel.
(c)  Maximum lift of the valve
h = Lift of the valve.
The lift of the valve may be obtained by equating the area across the valve seat to the area of the
port. For a conical valve, as shown in Fig. 32.22, we have
π dp· h cos  α =

The valve seats usually have the same angle as the
valve seating surface. But it is preferable to make the angle
of valve seat 1/2° to 1° larger than the valve angle as shown
in Fig. 32.23. This results in more effective seat.

valve is made of steel for which k = 0.42. The angle at which the valve disc seat is tapered is 30°.

32.24 Rocker Arm
The * rocker arm is used to actuate the
inlet and exhaust valves motion as directed
by the cam and follower. It may be made of
cast iron, cast steel, or malleable iron. In or-
der to reduce inertia of the rocker arm, an I-
section is used for the high speed engines
and it may be rectangular section for low
speed engines. In four stroke engines, the
rocker arms for the exhaust valve is the most
heavily loaded. Though the force required
to operate the inlet valve is relatively small,
yet it is usual practice to make the rocker
*
The rocker arm has also been discussed in Chapter 15 on Levers (Refer Art. 15.9).

arm for the inlet valve of the same dimensions as that for exhaust valve. A typical rocker arm for
operating the exhaust valve is shown in Fig. 32.24. The lever ratio a / b is generally decided by
considering the space available for rocker arm. For moderate and low speed engines, a / b is equal to
one. For high speed engines, the ratio a / b is taken as 1/ 1.3. The various forces acting on the rocker
arm of exhaust valve are the gas load, spring force and force due to valve acceleration.
Fig. 32.24. Rocker arm for exhaust valve.
Let
mv = Mass of the valve,
dv = Diameter of the valve head,
h = Lift of the valve,
a = Acceleration of the valve,
pc = Cylinder pressure or back pressure when the exhust valve opens, and
ps = Maximum suction pressure.

and force due to valve acceleration,

= mv × a
∴  Maximum load on the rocker arm for exhaust valve,
Fe = P + Fs + Fva
It may be noted that maximum load on the rocker arm for inlet valve is
Fi = Fs + Fva
Since the maximum load on the rocker arm for exhaust valve is more than that of inlet valve,
therefore, the rocker arm must be designed on the basis of maximum load on the rocker arm for
exhaust valve, as discussed below :
1. Design for fulcrum pin. The load acting on the fulcrum pin is the total reaction (RF) at the
fulcrum point.
Contents
Top
1194    A Textbook of Machine Design
Let
d1 = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l1 = Length of the fulcrum pin.
Considering the bearing of the fulcrum pin. We know that load on the fulcrum pin,
RF = d1 · l1 · pb
The ratio of l1 / d1 is taken as 1.25 and the bearing pressure ( pb ) for ordinary lubrication is taken
from 3.5 to 6 N / mm2 and it may go upto 10.5 N/mm2 for forced lubrication.
The pin should be checked for the induced shear stress.
The thickness of the phosphor bronze bush may be taken from 2 to 4 mm. The outside diameter
of the boss at the fulcrum is usually taken twice the diameter of the fulcrum pin.
2. Design for forked end. The forked end of the rocker arm carries a roller by means of a pin.
For uniform wear, the roller should revolve in the eyes. The load acting on the roller pin is Fc.
Let
d2 = Diameter of the roller pin, and
l2 = Length of the roller pin.
Consiering the bearing of the roller pin. We know that load on the roller pin,
Fc = d2 · l2 · pb
The ratio of l2 / d2 may be taken as 1.25. The roller pin should be checked for induced shear
stesss.
The roller pin is fixed in eye and the thickness of each eye is taken as half the length of the
roller pin.
∴ Thickness of each eye = l2 / 2
The radial  thickness of eye (t3) is taken as d1 / 2 . Therefore overall diameter of the eye,
D1 = 2 d1
The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (atleast 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye.
A clearance of 1.5 mm between the roller and the fork on either side of the roller is provided.
3. Design for rocker arm cross-section. The rocker arm may be treated as a simply supported
beam and loaded at the fulcrum point. We have already discussed that the rocker arm is generally of
I-section but for low speed engines, it can be of rectangular section. Due to the load on the  valve, the
rocker arm is subjected to bending moment.
Let
l = Effective length of each rocker arm, and
σb = Permissible bending stress.
We know that bending moment on the rocker arm,
M = Fe × l
...(i)
We also know that bending moment,
M = σb × Z
...(ii)
where
Z = Section modulus.
From equations (i) and (ii), the value of Z is obtained and thus the dimensions of the section are
determined.
4. Design for tappet. The tappet end of the rocker arm is made circular to receive the tappet
which is a stud with a lock nut. The compressive load acting on the tappet is the maximum load on the
rocker arm for the exhaust valve (Fe).
Let
dc = Core diameter of the tappet, and
σc = Permissible compressive stress for the material of the tappet which
is made of mild steel. It may be taken as 50 MPa.
We know that load on the tappet,
Fe =

From this expression, the core diameter of the tappet is determined. The outer or nominal diameter
of the tappet (dn) is given as
Contents
Top
Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1195
dn = dc / 0.84
The diameter of the circular end of the rocker arm (D3) and its depth (t4) is taken as twice the
nominal diameter of the tappet (dn), i.e.
D3 = 2 dn ;  and  t4 = 2 dn
5. Design for valve spring.The valve spring is used to provide sufficient force during the valve
lifting process in order to overcome the inertia of valve gear and to keep it with the cam without
bouncing. The spring is generally made from plain carbon spring steel. The total load for which the
spring is designed is equal to the sum of initial load and load at full lift.
Let
W1 = Initial load on the spring
= Force on the valve tending to draw it into the cylinder on suction
stroke,
W2 = Load at full lift
= Full lift × Stiffness of spring
∴ Total load on the spring,
W = W1 + W2
Note : Here we are only interested in calculating the total load on the spring. The design of the valve spring is
done in the similar ways as discussed for compression springs in Chapter 23 on Springs.
Example 32.7. Design a rocker arm, and its bearings, tappet, roller and valve spring for the
exhaust valve of a four stroke I.C. engine from the following data:
Diameter of the valve head = 80 mm; Lift of the valve = 25 mm; Mass of associated parts with
the valve = 0.4 kg ; Angle of action of camshaft = 110° ; R. P. M. of the crankshaft = 1500.
From the probable indicator diagram, it has been observed that the greatest back pressure
when the exhaust valve opens is 0.4 N/mm2 and the greatest suction pressure is 0.02 N/mm2 below
atmosphere.
The rocker arm is to be of I-section and the effective length of each arm may be taken as
180 mm ; the angle between the two arms being 135°.
The motion of the valve may be assumed S.H.M., without dwell in fully open position.
Choose your own materials and suitable values for the stresses.
Draw fully dimensioned sketches of the valve gear.
Solution. Given : dv = 80 mm ; h = 25 mm ; or r = 25 / 2 = 12.5 mm = 0.0125 m ; m = 0.4 kg ;
α = 110° ; N = 1500 r.p.m. ; pc = 0.4 N/mm2 ; ps = 0.02 N/mm2 ; l = 180 mm ; θ = 135°
A rocker arm for operating the exhaust valve is shown in Fig. 32.25.
First of all, let us find the various forces acting on the rocker arm of the exhaust valve.
We know that gas load on the valve,

Let us now design the various parts of the rocker arm.
1. Design of fulcrum pin
Let
d1 = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l1 = Length of the fulcrum pin = 1.25 d1
...(Assume)
Considering the bearing of the fulcrum pin. We know that load on the fulcrum pin (RF),
4545 = d1 × l1 × pb = d1 × 1.25 d1 × 5 = 6.25 (d1)2
...(For ordinary lubrication,  pb is taken as 5 N/mm2)
∴
(d1)2 = 4545 / 6.25 = 727 or d1 = 26.97 say 30 mm Ans.
and
l1 = 1.25 d1 = 1.25 × 30 = 37.5 mm Ans.
Now let us check the average shear stress induced in the pin. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore, load on the fulcrum pin (RF),

Assuming a phosphor bronze bush of 3 mm thick, the internal diameter of the hole in the lever,
dh = d1 + 2 × 3 = 30 + 6 = 36 mm
Let us now check the induced bending stress for the section of the boss at the fulcrum
which is shown in Fig. 32.26.

2. Design for forked end
Let
d2 = Diameter of the roller pin,
and
l2 = Length of the roller pin
 = 1.25 d1 ...(Assume)
Considering bearing of the roller pin. We know that load on the roller pin (Fc),
2460 = d2 × l2 × pb = d2 × 1.25 d2 × 7 = 8.75 (d2)2
... (Taking pb = 7 N / mm2)
∴
(d2)2
= 2460 / 8.75 = 281 or d2 = 16.76 say 18 mm Ans.
and
l2 = 1.25 d2 = 1.25 × 18 = 22.5 say 24 mm Ans.
Let us now check the roller pin for induced shearing stress. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore, load on the roller pin (Fc),

The maximum bending moment will occur at Y–Y.

This bending stress induced in the pin is within permissible limits.
Since the radial thickness of eye (t3) is taken as d2 / 2, therefore, overall diameter of the eye,
D2 = 2 d2 = 2 × 18 = 36 mm
The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (atleast 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye.
In the present case, 42 mm outer diameter of the roller will be
sufficient.

fork on either side of the roller, we have

The cross-section of the roker arm is obtained by considering

sides, such as section A – A and B – B.

and
depth of the section = 6 t = 6 × 8 = 48 mm Ans.
Normally thickness of the flange and web is constant throughout, whereas the width and depth
is tapered.
4. Design for tappet screw
The adjustable tappet screw carries a compressive load of Fe = 2460 N. Assuming the screw is
made of mild steel for which the compressive stress (σc) may be taken as 50 MPa.

We shall use 10 mm stud and it is provided with a lock nut. The diameter of the circular end of
the arm (D3) and its depth (t4) is taken as twice the diameter of stud.
∴
D3 = 2 × 10 = 20 mm Ans.
and
t4 = 2 × 10 = 20 mm Ans.
5. Design for valve spring
First of all, let us find the total load on the valve spring.
We know that initial load on the spring,
W1 = Initial spring force (Fs) = 96.6 N
...(Already calculated)
and load at full lift,
W2 = Full valve lift × Stiffiness of spring (s)
= 25 × 10 = 250 N
...(Assuming s = 10 N/mm)
∴ Total load on the spring,
W = W1 + W2 = 96.6 + 250 = 346.6 N
Now let us find the various dimensions for the valve spring, as discussed below:
(a)  Mean diameter of spring coil
Let
D = Mean diameter of the spring coil, and
d = Diameter of the spring wire.

...(Assuming τ = 420 MPa or N/mm2)
∴
d 2 = 8360 / 420 = 19.9   or   d = 4.46 mm
The standard size of the wire is SWG 7 having diameter ( d ) = 4.47 mm. Ans. (See Table 22.2).
∴ Mean diameter of the spring coil,
D = C · d = 8 × 4.47 = 35.76 mm Ans.
and outer diameter of the spring coil,
Do = D + d = 35.76 + 4.47 = 40.23 mm Ans.
(b)  Number of turns of the coil
Let
n = Number of active turns of the coil.
We know that maximum compression of the spring,

For squared and ground ends, the total number of the turns,
n′ =  n + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 Ans.
(c)  Free length of the spring
Since the compression produced under W2 = 250 N is 25 mm (i.e. equal to full valve lift),
therefore, maximum compression produced ( δ max) under the maximum load of W = 346.6 N is
 δmax = 25

We know that free length of the spring,

The valve opens 33º before outer dead cerntre and closes 1º after inner dead centre. It opens
and closes with constant acceleration and decleration for each half of the lift. The length of the
rocker arm on either side of the fulcrum is 150 mm and the included angle is 160º. The weight of the
valve is 3 N.
Solution. Given : D = 140 mm = 0.14 m ; L = 270 mm = 0.27 m ; Power = 8.25 kW = 8250 W ;
N = 475 r.p.m ; p = 3.5 N/mm2 ; l = 150 mm = 0.15 m ; θ = 160° ; w = 3 N

The projected width of the valve seat, for a seat angle of 45º, may be empirically taken as
0.05 dp to 0.07 dp. Let us take width of the valve seat as 0.06 dp i.e. 0.06 × 45 = 2.7 mm.
∴ Valve head diameter, dv =  dp + 2 × 2.7 = 45 + 5.4 = 50.4 say 51 mm Ans.
Now let us calculate the various forces acting on the rocker arm of exhaust valve.

The force due to acceleration (Fa) may be obtained as discussed below :
We know that total angle of crank for which the valve remains open
= 33 + 180 + 1 = 214º
Since the engine is a four stroke engine, therefore the camshaft angle for which the valve
remains open
= 214 / 2 = 107º
Now, when the camshaft turns through 107 / 2 = 53.5°, the valve lifts by a distance of 16 mm. It
may be noted that the half of this period is occupied by constant acceleration and half by constant
decleration. The same process occurs when the valve closes. Therefore, the period for constant
acceleration is equal to camshaft rotation of 53.5 / 2 = 26.75 º and during this time, the valve lifts
through a distance of 8 mm.
We know that speed of camshaft

Fa = m · a + w =

9.81  × 45.274 + 3 = 16.84 N

We know that the maximum load on the rocker arm for exhaust valve,
Fe = P + Fs + Fa = 820 + 48 + 16.84 = 884.84 say 885 N
Since the length of the two arms of the rocker are equal, therefore, load at the two ends of the
arm are equal, i.e. Fe = Fc = 885 N.

Let
d1 = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l1 = Length of the fulcrum pin = 1.25 d1
... (Assume)
Considering the bearing of the fulcrum pin. We know that load on the fulcrum pin (RF),
1743 = d1 × l1 × pb = d1 × 1.25 d1 × 5 = 6.25 (d1)2
... (For ordinary lubrication, pb is taken as 5 N/mm2)
∴
(d1)2 = 1743 / 6.25 = 279 or d1 = 16.7 say 17 mm
and
 l1 = 1.25 d1 = 1.25 × 17 = 21.25 say 22 mm
Now let us check the average shear stress induced in the pin. Since the pin is in double shear,

Considering bearing of the roller pin. We know that load on the roller pin (Fc),

Let us now check the induced bending stress in the roller
pin. The pin is neither simply supported in fork nor rigidly fixed
at the end. Therefore, the common practice is to assume the load
distribution as shown in Fig. 32.31.
The maximum bending moment will occur at Y– Y.
Neglecting the effect of clearance, we have

Since the radial thickness of eye (t3) is taken as d2 / 2, therefore, overall diameter of the eye,
D2= 2 d2 = 2 × 11 = 22 mm
The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (at least 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye. In the present case, 28 mm outer diameter of the roller will be sufficient.
Providing a clearance of 1.5 mm between the roller and the fork on either side of the roller, we have

3. Design for rocker arm cross-section
Since the engine is a slow  speed engine, therefore, a rectangular section may be selected for the
rocker arm. The cross-section of the rocker arm is obtained by considering the bending of the sections
just near the boss of fulcrum on both sides, such as section A–A and B– B.

of fulcrum to outside diameter of the eye (for the forked end side)
and from boss diameter of fulcrum to thickness t3 (for the tappet or

The adjustable tappet screw carries a compressive load of Fe = 885 N. Assuming the screw to
be made of mild steel for which the compressive stress (σc) may be taken as 50 MPa.

the arm (D3) and its depth (t4) is taken as twice the diameter of stud.
∴
D3 = 2 × 6.5 = 13 mm  Ans.
and
t4 = 2 × 6.5 = 13 mm Ans.
5. Design for valve spring
First of all, let us find the total load on the valve spring.
We know that intial load on the spring,
W1 = Initial spring force (Fs) = 48 N
...(Already calculated)
and load at full lift,
W2 = Full valve lift × Stiffness of spring (s)
= 16 × 8 = 128 N
...(Taking s = 8 N/mm)
∴ Total load on the spring,
W = W1 + W2  = 48 + 128 = 176 N
Now let us find the various dimensions for the valve spring as discussed below:
(a)  Mean diameter of the spring coil
Let
D = Mean diameter of the spring coil, and
d = Diameter of the spring wire.

(see Table 22.2)
∴ Mean diameter of spring coil,
D = C · d = 6 × 2.946 = 17.676 mm  Ans.
and outer diameter of the spring coil,

Design of cam
The cam is forged as one piece with the camshaft. It is designed as discussed below :
The diameter of camshaft (D′) is taken empirically as
D′ = 0.16 × Cylinder bore + 12.7 mm
= 0.16 × 140 + 12.7 = 35.1 say 36 mm
The base circle diameter is about 3 mm greater than the camshaft diameter.
∴Base circle diameter
= 36 + 3 = 39 say 40 mm
The width of cam is taken equal to the width of roller, i.e. 14 mm.
The width of cam (w′) is also taken empirically as
w ′ = 0.09 × Cylinder bore + 6 mm = 0.09 × 140 +6 = 18.6 mm
Let us take the width of cam as 18 mm.
Now the *cam is drawn according to the procedure given below :
First of all, the displacement diagram, as shown in Fig. 32.32, is drawn as discussed in the
following steps :
1. Draw a horizontal line ANM such that AN represents the angular displacement when valve
opens (i.e. 53.5º) to some suitable scale. The line NM represents the angular displacement
of the cam when valve closes (i.e. 53.5º).
2. Divide AN and NM into any number of equal even parts (say six).
3. Draw vertical lines through points 0, 1, 2, 3 etc. equal to the lift of valve i.e. 16 mm.
4. Divide the vertical lines 3 – f and 3′ – f ′ into six equal parts as shown by points a, b, c ... and
a′, b′, c′ .... in Fig. 32.32.
5. Since the valve moves with equal uniform acceleration and decleration for each half of the
lift, therefore, valve displacement diagram for opening and closing of valve consists of
double parabola.

diameter equal 40 mm (radius = 40/2
= 20 mm)
2. Draw a prime circle with centre O and
radius, OA= Min. radius of cam + 1

2  × 28
                              = 20 + 14 = 34 mm
3. Draw angle AOG = 53.5º to represent opening of valve and angle GOM = 53.5º to represent
closing of valve.
4. Divide the angular displacement of the cam during opening and closing of the valve (i.e.
angle AOG and GOM) into same number of equal even parts as in displacement diagram.
5. Join the points 1, 2, 3, etc. with the centre O and produce the lines beyond prime circle as
shown in Fig. 32.33.
6. Set off points 1B, 2C, 3D, etc. equal to the displacements from displacement diagram.
7. Join the points A, B, C, ...L, M, A. The curve drawn through these points is known as pitch curve.
