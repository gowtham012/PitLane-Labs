ABSTRACT 
Restricting the flow rate of air to the intake manifold is a 
convenient and popular method used by several motor 
sport disciplines to regulate engine performance.  This 
principle is applied in the Formula SAE and Formula 
Student competitions, the rules of which stipulate that all 
the air entering the engine must pass though a 20mm 
diameter orifice.  The restriction acts as a partially closed 
throttle which generates a vacuum in the inlet plenum.  
During the valve overlap period of the cycle, which may 
be as much as 100 degrees crank angle in the 
motorcycle engines used by most FSAE competitors, this 
vacuum causes reverse flow of exhaust gas into the 
intake runners.  This, in turn, reduces the amount of 
fresh air entering the cylinder during the subsequent 
intake stroke and therefore reduces the torque produced.  
This effect is particularly noticeable at medium engine 
speeds when the time available for reverse flow is 
greater than at the peak torque speed. 
The objective of the study described in this paper was to 
mitigate the reverse flow effect by reducing the duration 
of the valve overlap period.  A thermodynamic model of 
the Yamaha YZF R6 engine was developed for this 
purpose and validated using cycle-averaged and crank-
angle-resolved test data. The resulting model was then 
used to find the optimum values of lift, duration and 
timing for both the intake and exhaust valves. The 
camshafts required to give these valve lift profiles were 
designed using valve train analysis software. This 
process included a consideration of the dynamic forces 
encountered by the valve train and ensured that the 
resulting stresses remained within safe limits.  
The new camshafts increased the torque output by up to 
30% at medium engine speeds, without reducing the 
high-speed torque, and therefore significantly improved 
the vehicle drivability. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
To be eligible to compete in the Formula SAE or Formula 
Student events, the rules [1] dictate the use of a four-
stroke engine with a maximum displacement of 610 cm3 
and that all air supplied to the engine must pass through 
a single Ø20 mm restrictor for a gasoline fuelled car.   
 
The engine of choice for the majority of teams is a stock 
600 cm3 motorcycle engine [2, 3]. The Queen’s Formula 
Racing (QFR) team employs a 2003-2005 Yamaha YZF 
R6 engine, the specification of which is shown in Table 1. 
It was chosen as it has one of the longest piston strokes 
of this classification of engine and, in its stock 
specification, is designed to produce peak torque of 68.5 
Nm at 12,000 rpm.  This high performance engine 
employs the full benefit of exhaust system tuning by 
using a large valve overlap to scavenge the clearance 
volume of exhaust gas therefore increasing high-speed 
torque.

However, in engines with a large valve overlap, the part-
load operation is poor due to a reduced induction 
manifold pressure.  This causes exhaust gases to travel 
back through the cylinder, past the intake valve and into 
the intake system when both valves are open [4, 5].  As 
the engine has to be restricted under the FSAE rules, it 
effectively operates at part load.  The standard engine is 
therefore not fully optimized for use in a restricted format.  
This affects the torque produced by the engine and 
ultimately the drivability of the car. To develop the engine 
and give a desirable torque curve during competition 
conditions, where engine speed is typically in the range 
3000-12000 rpm, modification of the intake and exhaust 
camshafts was undertaken. Previous research within the 
team concentrated on modification of the intake cam 
shaft only in an older model of the engine [6, 7].  To 
reduce the effects of the Ø20mm restrictor, yet maintain 
a naturally aspirated configuration, an approach of 
reducing the valve overlap was used.  
 
STOCK LIFT PROFILES 
The valve lift profiles of the stock engine were carefully 
measured at ambient conditions using the recommended 
clearances between the camshaft base circle and the 
bucket (0.15 – 0.2 mm).  The resulting profiles are 
plotted in Figure 1 and their durations and peak lifts are 
listed in Table 2.

As discussed earlier a high performance engine has a 
substantial 
valve 
overlap 
to 
increase 
volumetric 
efficiency.  Due to the exhaust valve opening before BDC 
on the power stroke a compression wave is generated 
which travels along the exhaust pipe.  When this wave 
meets an increase in area at the collector, an expansion 
wave is generated which travels back towards the 
exhaust port.  If the inlet valve is open when this 
expansion wave arrives at the port then the wave draws 
particles from the intake system into the cylinder, due to 
a lower pressure in the cylinder than in the intake 
plenum.  However, due to the use of a mandatory 
restrictor on the engine during the FSAE competition, the 
pressure in the intake plenum is lower than in the 
exhaust system and so, during the valve overlap period, 
there is a reverse flow of exhaust gas into the intake 
system.   
 
This is demonstrated by a virtual model of the stock 
engine fitted with the FSAE competition intake system 
with 
the 
mandatory 
restrictor 
incorporated. 
This 
simulation was conducted using a computer simulation 
package, Virtual Engines (VE) [8].  This software bases 
its results on fundamental unsteady gas dynamics [9]. 
For reliance on the predicted data it is of utmost 
importance that the model is validated by empirical 
results [10, 11 and 12]. The engine model used was the 
subject of an extensive validation process described in 
detail by Walkingshaw [13].  Therefore the engine model 
could be used confidently for thermodynamic analysis.  
Figure 2 shows air purity just upstream of the inlet valve 
at 5000 rpm and wide open throttle (WOT), where 1 is 
fresh charge and 0 is exhaust gas.  It can be seen during 
the overlap period between IO1 and EC1 that the gas 
purity drops, indicating the presence of exhaust gas in 
the intake manifold.  Figure 3 shows mass flow rate and 
confirms that reverse flow occurs during the overlap 
period.

Figure 3 – Mass Flow Rate at intake valve at 5000 rpm 
 
This analysis suggests that reducing the valve overlap 
and hence backflow, could result in increased torque 
across the engine’s speed range (5000 – 12000 rpm). 
 
In addition to the reverse flow during the overlap phase, 
the engine also experiences reverse flow as fresh charge 
escapes through the intake valve at the beginning of the 
compression stroke before the intake valve shuts.  This 
is due to the standard engine being tuned for higher 
speeds to make use of a ramming wave to force fresh 
charge into the cylinder at this point in the cycle.  
However, at lower engine speeds, the ramming wave 
does not return to the port at the optimum time and so, 
with fixed valve timing, the piston pumps some air back 
through the inlet valve at the beginning of the 
compression stroke.  This negative flow effect is 
highlighted by Figures 4 and 5 showing purity and mass 
flow rate between BDC and the intake valve closing IC1 
at 5000rpm.

OPTIMISATION PROCESS 
The validated R6 engine model was then optimized using 
the Automated Design (AD) software from Optimum 
Power Technology [8]. This software applies an 
extensive optimization process to the validated baseline 
model based on a design goal and strategy.  
 
The design goal in this case was “maximize torque” 
within the specific usable speed range (5000-12000 rpm) 
and the design strategy was based on varying the target 
parameters shown in Table 3.  This design space 
contains 2.03 x 1011 possible engine configurations. 
Obviously, for this optimization process to be reliable, the 
baseline engine model has to have been carefully 
validated. 
 
An optimum engine design was found after analyzing 
1230 engines, which took over 4.5 days on a Pentium 4 
3GHz CPU with 1 Gb RAM. The optimum parameters 
can also be seen in Table 3.

This automated design optimization converged on a 
“best engine” design that showed the greatest torque 
benefits in the low to mid speed range. The speed range 
chosen for such an optimization process is very 
important as it will have a considerable impact on the 
final optimal design. As discussed earlier, it was known 
that the standard valve durations and overlap were 
deficient at the lower speeds, so it was hoped that the 
new best design would improve performance in this 
region. At the higher speed the restrictor becomes the 
limiting factor on the performance. 
 
After the optimum configuration was found, a sensitivity 
analysis was carried out to find which parameter had the 
most individual influence on engine performance. The 
same baseline engine model was used and the analysis 
showed that the intake and exhaust valve events 
provided the most substantial gains in performance. 
Figure 6, shows the simulated baseline engine torque, 
the torque predicted from this baseline engine with new 
intake and exhaust valve duration and timing events, and 
the predicted torque from the optimized baseline engine 
(table 3).

Therefore, considering each of the optimum parameters 
in Table 3, the best torque gains could be achieved from 
modifying the valve lift profiles as predicted by the 
optimization process. Table 3 shows that this would 
mean keeping the valves peak lifts the same but 
reducing their duration. 
 
AUTOMATED DESIGN LIFT PROFILES 
During the automated design (AD) process, the virtual 
model reduced the negative effects of reverse flow by 
reducing the valve overlap period.  This was done by 
decreasing the intake and exhaust valve durations by 
19% and 14% respectively. The automated design also 
found that both the intake and exhaust valve peak lift 
optimum positions were ten degrees earlier than the 
stock engine.  The closing angle of the inlet valve is then 
also advanced by this ten degrees therefore reducing the 
reverse flow of fresh charge out of the cylinder during the 
initial phase of the compression stroke.  The AD’s 
optimized valve lift profiles are shown in Figure 7, in 
comparison to the stock engines valve lift profiles, and 
the reduction in valve overlap period along with the 
earlier closing of the intake valve can be clearly seen. 
Both are shown with no clearance between bucket and 
camshaft lobe.

This thermodynamic optimization gives no consideration 
to the mechanical viability of these valve lift designs.  
Therefore it was necessary to check not only the 
mechanical feasibility of this new design, but also to 
determine whether it was possible to manufacture 
camshafts that would produce such lift profiles given the 
design constraints of cam base circle radius and bucket 
tappet diameter.  There is a complex design relationship 
between both of these variables, the valve lift profiles 
and the manufacturability of the cam profiles. 
 
MECHANICAL ANALYSIS 
Changing a lift profile can impact the valve train 
dynamics and the durability of the components [4, 14].  
To assess the mechanical implications of the proposed 
lift profile, a mechanical analysis was required using 
valvetrain mechanical analysis software called 4stHEAD 
[15, 16].  This software has been extensively used to 
analyze valve train dynamics and scrutinize the effects of 
particular lift profiles and components used [17, 18, 19 
and 20].  
 
The software allows the designer to import or design lift 
profiles from which suitable cam profiles and all the 
associated valvetrain components can be analyzed and 
designed. The software can be provided with existing 
valvetrain geometry and valve lift profiles.  These profiles 
can be manipulated such that the cam profiles meet the 
design criteria and fall within the limitations of the 
existing components and cylinder head layout. If the 
proposed lift profiles are more aggressive this can invoke 
effects such as valve float and bounce, generate higher 
stress, and have tribology and geometric implications. 
 
Therefore to conduct this analysis, the valve-train and 
associated components within the engine needed to be 
measured and the data input to the software.  The 
valves, buckets, springs and the masses for each were 
measured as shown in Tables 4-7 with the respective 
component images from the 4stHEAD software. The 
combustion chamber was also measured as the software 
can check for valve to piston interference.

The narrower valve lift profiles produced by the 
optimization process were input to the 4stHEAD 
software. These profiles were matched precisely within 
the software, but the ensuing cam profiles could not be 
directly produced for two reasons. Firstly, the original 
shortened valve lifts had maximum velocities that were 
not compatible with the bucket follower diameters in the 
R6 cylinder head. The simple fact is that bucket diameter 
is a function of valve-lift velocity (i.e. the first derivative of 
the valve lift with respect to cam angle) – the higher the 
velocity the larger the bucket diameter to ensure contact 
between the cam and bucket. Secondly, there is a 
complex relationship between the radius of curvature of 
the ensuing cam profile, the base circle radius of the 
cam and the valve-lift acceleration (i.e. the second 
derivative of the valve lift with respect to cam angle) 
which also affects manufacturability of the cam profile.  
The bucket diameters and the base circle radii of the 
cams could not be changed and therefore the new 
narrower valve lift profiles had to be manipulated within 
4stHEAD to ensure that feasible cam profiles could be 
manufactured based on the aforementioned constraints. 
Other factors that are constantly checked in this iterative 
process are the cam to follower Hertz stresses and oil 
film thicknesses to ensure that they remain within 
recommended limits.  Figure 8 shows the finalized intake 
valves 
lift 
profiles 
with 
its 
associated 
velocity, 
acceleration and jerk characteristics. The key points to 
note here are the shape and smoothness of the 
acceleration profile as it is this that is manipulated to 
achieve the goals described previously. 
 
 
Figure 8 – Finalized Intake Valve Lift Characteristics 
 
The output of this mechanical analysis is a set of 
camshaft profiles as well as new valve lift profiles.  The 
new valve lift profiles are shown in Figure 9 compared to 
the original shortened profiles from the optimization 
process.  This shows that the valve lift profiles had to be 
slightly more aggressive than the original shortened 
profiles with larger area envelopes.  It was therefore 
necessary to run a new 1-D simulation with these new 
valve lift profiles to ensure they would not detrimentally 
affect the predicted torque.   Figure 10 shows the torque 
curve for the original shortened profiles from the 
optimization process compared to the 4stHEAD profiles.

The 4stHEAD software was also used to check that the 
new valve lifts and their respective timing events would 
not cause any interference with the piston. In addition, it 
was necessary to check that the new valve lifts would not 
cause any problems to the dynamics of the valvetrain. 
First of all the dynamics of the valvetrain with the original 
valve lift profiles were modeled and these were then 
compared to the dynamics of the valvetrain with the new 
valve lift profiles. There were no anomalies with float, 
bounce or separation of the valvetrain components in the 
relevant speed range and the maximum stresses were 
within acceptable limits.  
 
The modified camshaft profiles could be manufactured 
by regrinding the stock camshafts.  The modified 
camshafts were then placed in the engine and the 
valvetrain was re-shimmed due to slight changes in the 
camshafts 
base 
circle 
diameters 
due 
to 
the 
manufacturing process.  The valve lift profiles of the 
modified camshafts were measured and compared to 
the lift profiles that were provided by the mechanical 
analysis software to ensure that the manufacturing 
process was successful.  The modified camshaft valve 
lifts are shown in Figure 13 in comparison to the stock 
profiles.  The reduction in valve overlap and the earlier 
IVC timing are clearly visible.  Stock and modified inlet 
camshafts are shown in Figure 14.

desired settings. 
 
Using the VE model of the baseline engine with the 
4stHEAD camshafts, a simulation was conducted to 
examine the changes the camshafts had made on the 
reverse flow effects.  A comparison of air purity and the 
mass flow rate for the stock and modified camshaft 
engines at 5000 rpm are shown in Figures 15 and 16.  
These show an increase in charge purity and a decrease 
in the reverse flow using the modified camshafts.

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION 
The modified camshafts were tested on a 145kW 
Schenck dynamometer with the driveshaft connected to 
the gearbox output shaft.  A Horiba MEXA-7170DEGR 
Exhaust Emissions Analyzer was used to measure AFR.  
The engine is fitted with a custom fuel injection and 
ignition system which are controlled by a DTA ECU.  The 
engine was mapped at full load throughout the speed 
range between 3000 to 12500 rpm with fuel adjusted to 
leanest for best torque and ignition timing adjusted to 
minimum advance for best torque for both the standard 
camshaft and the modified camshaft configurations.  
Figure 17 shows the full load corrected brake torque 
curve comparison between the two tests. 
 
 
Figure 17 – Comparison of Engine Torque 
 
It can be seen that there are large torque gains in the 
lower speed range with a maximum of 30% gain at 5500 
rpm.  The peak torque increased by around 12% at 8500 
rpm and an average torque increase across the speed 
range of 15.3% was achieved.  There are smaller gains 
at speeds greater than 11000 rpm due to the the airflow 
becoming increasingly choked through the restrictor. 
 
During the optimization process, the Automated Design 
feature found that an optimum runner length would be 
260 mm.  It was decided to investigate this factor by 
increasing the length in the direction indicated by the 
analysis but not to the extent recommended due to 
difficulties in packaging such a long runner length within 
the FSAE car.  Therefore an extension of 50mm in 
runner length was implemented and the engine 
remapped at full load.  A comparison of the engine with 
the extended runners and modified camshafts is shown 
compared to the standard runners and modified 
camshafts in Figure 18.

As expected mid-range torque was increased but the 
torque started to decrease slightly at higher engine 
speeds.  A maximum gain of 6.9% at 6000 rpm was 
achieved using the extended runner lengths. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The modified camshafts increased the low to mid-range 
torque output by: 
1. Reducing the valve overlap period and therefore the 
reverse flow. 
2. Advancing the intake valve closing point thereby 
reducing the amount of reverse flow occurring at the 
beginning of the compression stroke. 
These changes to the valve timing increased the torque 
output by a maximum of 30% at 5500 rpm in the 
restricted FSAE engine.  However if these camshafts 
were used in the unrestricted stock engine then at high 
speeds the valve timing settings would greatly reduce its 
performance.  When the modified camshafts are used in 
conjunction with the restrictor, the restrictor masks the 
negative effects of the camshafts at the higher engine 
speeds as it becomes the limiting factor on the engine’s 
performance.
