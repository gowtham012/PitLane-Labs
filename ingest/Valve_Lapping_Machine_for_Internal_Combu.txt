1   INTRODUCTION 
Valve lapping or the process of creating a good seat between engine valves and the 
corresponding valve seat area in the IC (internal combustion) engine head(cylinder head) is 
a task which have to be done very accurately. The importance of obtaining a good sea is that 
the air/fuel mixture(in petrol engines) or air(in diesel engines) is prevented from flowing in to 
the combustion chamber, same as the exhaust gas is prevented from flowing to the exhaust 
manifold from the combustion chamber until the right time. And also a good seat prevents 
compression leaks. The engine will lose its efficiency by huge percentages if any of the 
situations explained above happens. So as this is a very important task in IC engine 
maintenance, extra attention is given to this particular task by technicians. This process of 
valve lapping is typically done using a valve lapping stick or a power tool. As both of this 
tools are not very effective, these tools can be replaced by the ' Valve Lapping Machine for 
Internal Combustion Engines', specifically designed for the process of engine valve lapping. 
The machine employs a fully mechanical system which performs two different motions in two 
directions previously performed by hand when using valve lapping stick and power tool. 
Comparatively the valve lapping machine is very effective because the human involvement is 
very limited in the process.

1.1  Motivation 
The idea of designing a machine for the valve lapping process came to me when i was 
working as a trainee automobile technician at Transmec Engineering PVT(LTD) of Micro 
Holdings Group from June to September 2014. I was assigned to the Engine room section 
where the maintenance of an IC engine is done. Engine overhauling was a daily 
maintenance process and i came through the valve lapping process during my 3rd week. The 
valves of a 3.0L 20 valve in-line engine. The process took about ten hours to finish including 
testing of the valve seat quality using petrol. As the process was done using a valve lapping 
stick, it was very hard and my efficiency of performing the process was very low after couple 
of hours. During my 11th week, I was introduced to valve lapping power tool which is 
comparatively more efficient than the valve lapping stick and took less time to complete the 
process. But still the hand holding the power tool and performing the hand motion was hard. 
This lead me to think how easy this process will be if there was a machine that has the 
performance of the power tool and the motion of the hand. 'Valve Lapping Machine for 
Internal Combustion Engines' was designed by the motivation of that idea. 
1.2  Goals and objectives 
The main goal of this project is to design a machine both efficient and effective than 
previously used methods for valve lapping and to reduce the labor cost by reducing the 
human involvement in the process. The objectives that had to be achieved in order to 
achieve the main goal were designing the basic model of the machine(structure), designing 
the valve lapping mechanism, assembly of the whole machine by designing the parts 
needed, calculating and designing the cam needed, analyzing data and categorizing them in 
order to design five valve holding pieces, analyzing data to obtain the specifications of the 
machine, obtaining two high torque dc motors that has specific RPM(revolutions per minute) 
values and deciding what materials must be used in order for the design to be durable and 
economical. 
1.3  Literature review 
Valve lapping and testing 
In the process of valve lapping in an internal combustion engine cylinder head, the goal is to 
achieve a good seat between valve seating area of an engine valve(inlet valve or outlet 
valve) and the valve seat area of cylinder head in order to avoid the compression leaks 
through the seating from the combustion chamber and to avoid air/fuel-air mixture leaking in 
to the combustion chamber through the seating. The internal combustion engine operates by 
achieving a certain compression ratio which is differing from engine to engine and 
combusting a air-fuel mixture which is compressed to a certain volume decided by the 
compression ratio. And if the air-fuel mixture leaks through the seating, the volume of the air-
fuel mixture will change and combustion process will not be accurate resulting a reduction in 
productivity of the engine. Therefore it is vital to have a fully sealed combustion chamber and 
the valve seating is very important in acquiring a fully sealed combustion chamber.

Figure 01: Valves positioned in the cylinder head [1] 
 
While the valve lapping process, we have to observe the valve seat area time to time by the 
naked eye. It's the normal way to conclude whether the valve seat is good or further valve 
lapping is needed. Figure 02 shows a lapped valve and a non-lapped valve. 
 
 
Figure 02: Lapped and non-lapped valves [2] 
After the valve lapping process, the most common way to observe the seating of valves is a 
technique using petrol. After the valve job is done, the mechanic or technician place the 
precise valve in the precise spot in the cylinder head and pour petrol to the stem of the valve 
which he have to observe. This poured petrol then reaches the seating area of the valve. 
Then it is observed if petrol leaks through the seat.  
 
4 
 
 
Figure 03: Observation of the seating surface [3] 
If petrol leaks through the valve seat it concludes that the valve job is not successful and if 
petrol does not leaks through the valve seat it concludes that the valve has acquired a good 
seat, so recommending to assemble the engine using the valve. 
Engine valves 
There are two kinds of engine valves, intake/inlet valves and exhaust/outlet valves. These 
valves could be identified easily in a cylinder head. Inlet valves are usually bigger than 
exhaust valves. Although more than one inlet valve and exhaust valve can be present for a 
single cylinder. There are different designs for inlet valves and exhaust valves. The most 
commonly used valve design is poppet valve design. Then there are sodium valves used in 
some turbo-charges engines. And mask valves, mushroom valves, tulip valves could be 
observed in different situations. The following figure shows a detailed diagram of a valve. 
 
Figure 04: Detailed diagram of an engine valve [4]

As you can see in the figure 04 the seat angle is the most important thing in the valve lapping 
process. Seat angle is normally 45° and 30° in most of valves. 
The other important factor of designing the valve lapping machine is the stem diameter of the 
valve. The valve is to be fixed to the valve lapping machine in order to start the lapping 
process by the stem of the valve. The dimensions from the collected data of valves are 
analyzed in order to acquire three categories of  stem diameters. These analyzed data is 
used for the specifications of valve holding pieces of the machine to be built. Overall length 
of the valve is also a important factor to consider when adjusting the machines before 
starting the valve lapping process. 
Valve lapping stick and hand motion 
Valve lapping sticks are the tools that we use to lap valves by hand movement. The valve is 
attached to the sucker at the tip of the stick and lapping compound is applied before the 
process begins. This is a very hard process to undergo and it will take approximately half an 
hour to lap one valve of a 3.0 L engine. Following figures shows the valve lapping sticks and 
the hand movement used to lap valves. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 05: Commonly used valve lapping sticks [5] 
 
 
Figure 06: Hand movement while lapping valves [6] 
6 
 
While lapping valves as shown in figure 06, the technician have to decide whether to apply 
compound from observing the valve seat area time to time. This method is still used in basic 
garages. 
Valve lapping power tool 
Using the valve lapping power tool is much more efficient than the valve lapping by hand 
movement. It will take less than 15 minutes to lap a valve using the power tool. But still we 
have to hold the power tool in position for lapping process, which is somewhat hard labor to 
undergo. Power tools work using an electric motor or pneumatically using compressed air. 
 
Figure 07: Valve lapping using a power tool [7] 
Lapping compound 
Lapping compound is applied to the valve seat before beginning of the process. Lapping 
compound wears surfaces of the valve and the valve seat of the cylinder block smoothing 
both surfaces and creating a good seat. A lapping compound tube usually has two types of 
compound available in the top end and bottom end separately. The two types named as fine 
and coarse. Technician decides which type of compound has to be used by observing the 
valve seat. If the valve seat has rough edges, coarse compound is used. Otherwise fine 
compound is used obtain a smooth surface. 
Cylinder head 
Cylinder head is the casting which seals the combustion end of the cylinder block and the 
inlet and exhaust valves and their ports are positioned in the cylinder head for air/fuel mixture 
intake and exhaust of  the combustion products[8]. Cylinder head also facilitate overhead 
cam shafts if present and otherwise it facilitate rocker arms and valve springs. 
Cam system 
As a cam system is implemented in the machine, it is better to have a idea about cam 
systems. A cam , follower, follower system and a drive are the four basic parts of a cam 
system. Clyde H. Moon, P.E.[9] states that "A cam is a mechanical part which imparts a 
prescribed motion to another part by direct contact. It may remain stationary, translate or 
7 
 
rotate". Follower is directly contacting the cam while the follower system receives a specific 
motion through the follower given by the cam. Drive is the element which transmits motion to 
the cam or to the follower system. 
 
Figure 08: Cam and follower [10] 
DC motors 
Two dc motors are used in the valve lapping machine, one as the drive for cam system and 
one as the motor for valve lapping.

2   DESIGN OF VALVE LAPPING MACHINE FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES 
This section includes designs of all the parts of the valve lapping machine and their functions 
in the machine. 
 
Figure 11: Trimetric view of the 3D model of valve lapping machine for internal combustion 
engines 
 
2.1  Machine bed 
Machine bed is the base of the valve lapping machine. The cylinder head can be initially kept 
on the machine bed for measuring or observing purposes and the bed is designed to 
accommodate a cylinder as large as TATA 1030 cylinder head(cylinder head of a in-line 6 
cylinder engine) without any problem. 
 
Figure 12: Isometric view of machine bed 
10 
 
Four rubber grips are mounted on the four corners of the machine bed in order keep it in a 
steady position even on a surface having less friction co-efficient. The machine stand which 
holds the valve lapping mechanism also assembled to the machine bed. It also facilitate two 
cylinder head supports. 
 
Figure 13: Exploded view of machine bed, cylinder head support and machine stand 
assembly 
The machine bed has a total surface are of 900×450 mm2 without considering the area given 
for mounting of the cylinder head supports and its moving purposes and the material 
assigned for the machine bed is AISI 1020 steel which has a mass density of 7900 Kg.m-3 
and the machine bed weighs about 79.8 Kg. The reason for picking AISI 1020 steel is its 
formability, workability and weld-ability was very good comparatively.   
2.2  Cylinder head supports 
The cylinder head supports are designed to accommodate the cylinder head while the valve 
lapping process. This extra feature is added to the design because it is hard to move a 
cylinder head(specially a large heavy one) sometimes when the cylinder head needed to be 
adjusted to a different position. Since this cylinder head supports are movable along the 
machine bed, it is very easy to adjust the cylinder head position. As an example, think that a 
specific point of the  cylinder head is initially positioned in the coordinate (300,280) if we 
assigned a coordinate system to the machine bed. And we need to change its position to 
(550,280), that means without compromising the Y coordinate, we can move the cylinder 
head 250 units smoothly along the bed( X axis). This feature is very important when lapping 
the same type of engine valves in an in-line cylinder head. 
 
 
11 
 
 
Figure 14: Isometric view of a cylinder head support 
The cylinder head supports also allow easy access to the valve seat area of the engine 
valves by having a 40mm clearance between the machine bed and cylinder head while the 
valve lapping process. This feature is important because the technician has to observe the 
valve seat surface from time to time and apply lapping compound if needed. Each cylinder 
head support has a surface area of 290×50 mm2 to accommodate 2 cross sections of a 
cylinder head. The material assigned to this part is also AISI 1020 steel and weighs about 
4.8 Kg per unit.  
2.3  Machine Stand 
 
Figure 15: Isometric view of Machine stand 
Machine stand is assembled to the machine bed in one end as in figure 13. Other end of the 
machine stand is the mounting for the valve lapping mechanism and also the holding bracket 
12 
 
for High torque, heavy duty 12V DC gear motor, mounted near the same end. Machine stand 
is designed to move(slide) 710mm  along the machine bed, therefore allowing the access to 
any valve position of a cylinder head placed on cylinder head supports. The load generated 
while the valve lapping process is transmitted to machine bed through the machine stand 
and the integrity of the structure is a very important factor to consider when designing. Lower 
end of machine stand which is assembled to machine bed is one of the areas of the machine 
with highest stress concentration. 
 
Figure 16: Forces affecting the machine stand from the lower end 
As can be seen in figure 16, the assembly area of the machine stand to machine bed is 
subjected to loads from machine bed surface and valve lapping process. And because valve 
lapping is a cyclic process(explained further in the text), the load from valve lapping process 
is a fatigue load and  therefore the chances of failing the structure of machine stand is more. 
So it is important to keep this structure in shape. The material assigned for this part also is  
AISI 1020 steel and it weighs about 10.9 Kg. 
The two surfaces where the machine stand comes to contact when assembling to the bed 
must have less friction coefficient in order to move the stand easily. Use of a semisolid 
lubricant like grease is a good solution for that task. 
2.4  20 RPM, high torque and heavy duty DC motor fixing bracket 
 
Figure 17: 20 RPM, high torque and heavy duty DC motor fixing bracket 
13 
 
This bracket holds the motor which transmit motion to the cam and as the cam subjects to 
some amount of torque, the same torque is transmitted though the motor to the bracket and 
therefore bracket is also subjected to the same torque. This bracket is fixed to the machine 
stand using two pan slot head bolts made using stainless steel. When made using AISI 1020 
steel, this bracket weighs about 379g. 
2.5  Cam and Cam Follower 
Cam is the main part responsible for the vertical movement of the valve lapping mechanism. 
Actually a cam works as a system that consist with a follower, a cam drive and a follower 
system. 
 
Figure 18: Cam 
 
Figure 19: Cam Follower 
The vertical motion is gained by the valve lapping mechanism(follower system) when the 
cam is rotated by the rotary motion of the 20 RPM, high torque and heavy duty DC motor 
which is the cam drive and the rotary motion is then converted in to linear(vertical) motion 
using the shape of cam nose and it is transmitted to the valve mechanism through the cam 
14 
 
follower. The vertical motion of the valve lapping mechanism helps to break the contact 
between valve seat and the corresponding surface of a cylinder head. The importance of this 
action is described further in the text.  
 
Figure 20: Conversion of motion through the cam system  
Figure 20 shows how the rotary motion is converted into linear motion. Cam follower is 
tensioned using a spring in the valve lapping mechanism and as the cam rotates, follower 
gain space to move upwards and when the cam nose area returns follower move downwards 
creating a linear motion. 
Cam Classification [13] 
Cam systems are classified using a standard classification method. Following text includes 
the classification of the cam system used in the valve lapping machine. 
1. Sequence of follower operation: 
    Dwell - Rise - Return - Dwell cam(DRRD) - In this type of cam, there is no dwell between 
rise and return. 
2. Follower shape: 
    Flat - face follower 
3. Follower motion: 
    Translating follower - Follower moves in a straight line. 
4. Follower position: 
    On - Center follower - Line of motion passes through the cam axis. 
5. Cam motion: 
    Rotating cam - Rotation is done at constant angular velocity. 
6. Cam shape: 
    Open cam (disk or plate cam) 
7. Follower Constraint: 
    Spring constraint - The contact between follower and cam profile is maintained by spring. 
15 
 
The valve lapping machine for internal combustion engines is mainly consist of three main 
units. The base, the sliding stand and the valve lapping mechanism. The next section of this 
text is about the parts and operations of the valve lapping mechanism. Parts that belong to 
the valve lapping mechanism are upper spring mounting bracket, tension spring, lower spring 
mounting bracket, 200rpm 12V dc gear motor fixing bracket, 200rpm 12V dc gear motor, 
valve holding piece mounting screw, 40mm extension piece and valve holding piece. 
2.6  Upper spring mounting bracket 
 
Figure 21: Upper spring mounting bracket 
Upper spring mounting bracket is assembled to the upper end of the machine stand by two 
pan slot head bolts. The main function of this part is  connecting the valve lapping 
mechanism and machine stand together. One side of the tension spring also welded to this 
part. 
 
Figure 22: Exploded view of upper spring mounting bracket assembly 
16 
 
The material assigned for this part is Aluminum alloy 1100. The reason for choosing an 
aluminum alloy is the lower mass density. Therefore the part will be of less weight. The upper 
spring mounting bracket only weighs about 102g when machined from aluminum alloy 1100. 
When Originally assigning the materials for parts, the choice was between 3 aluminum 
alloys. They were alloy 1100, alloy 2011 and alloy 3003. Following are some factors 
considered when choosing an aluminum alloy from above mentioned three. 
1. Formability and Workability [14] 
 
Alloy 1100 - excellent formability and workability 
 
Alloy 2011 - good formability and workability 
 
Alloy 3003 - excellent formability and workability 
2. Weldability 
 
Alloy 1100 - excellent weldability 
 
Alloy 2011 - poor weldability 
 
Alloy 3003 - excellent weldability 
3. Machinability 
 
Alloy 1100 - good machinability 
 
Alloy 2011 - excellent machinability 
 
Alloy 3003 - good machinability 
4. Corrosion Resistance 
 
Alloy 1100 - excellent corrosion resistance 
 
Alloy 2011 - poor corrosion resistance 
 
Alloy 3003 - good corrosion resistance 
Out of the three alloys, alloy 1100 is excellent at the key features that can be considered as 
benefits in the developing process. The same aluminum alloy is used in two more parts of 
this machine. 
2.7  Tension spring 
 
Figure 23: Tension spring 
17 
 
Tension spring is the link between upper spring mounting bracket and lower spring mounting 
bracket. They are connected by welding both ends of the spring to the two brackets. And the 
key function of the tension spring is to participate in the task of creating the linear(vertical) 
motion of the valve lapping mechanism. The spring diameter is 40mm, it has a pitch of 6 mm 
with 10 coils. Spring is made from a wire of 3mm diameter and it has a spring constant of 
3.164 N/mm. The spring is made up of steel and weighs about 75g. 
2.8  Lower spring mounting bracket. 
This part can be referred as the center of the valve lapping mechanism. That is because 
almost every part that makes the valve lapping mechanism functional connects with this part. 
The cam follower makes contact with this part according to the cam's motion, tension spring 
is welded to this part and the fixing bracket of the 200rpm 12V dc gear motor which actually 
do the lapping of valves is also assembled to this part. 
 
Figure 24: Lower spring mounting bracket 
The top face of the lower spring mounting bracket has a guide, to guide the cam follower and 
the lower end of cam follower always moves in this guide. When the cam system is working, 
the cam follower moves downwards and push the lower spring mounting bracket. As the 
bracket moves downwards, tension spring welded to it begins to deform and therefore a 
reaction force is creating. This force is directly transmitted to the cam through the follower 
and as the cam rotates, the follower moves upward using the force created by the spring 
while the spring takes its original structure. This process happens over and over when the 
machine is on and the linear motion is created by this process. 
Material assigned for lower spring mount is aluminum alloy 1100 because the reasons 
mentioned above in the text and one other reason to choose this light material is that tension 
spring has to hold the entire weight of the parts assembled to lower spring mounting bracket. 
This part weighs about 171g. 
 
18 
 
   
Figure 25: Exploded view of lower spring mounting bracket assembly 
2.9  200RPM, heavy duty 12V dc gear motor fixing bracket 
The motor that does the valve lapping is fixes to this bracket and this bracket is assembled to 
lower spring mounting bracket using two pan slot head bolts. This bracket  subjects to a 
torque when the machine is on. That torque generates from the valve seat and the 
reciprocating surface on the cylinder head. This part is also assigned to be developed in 
aluminum alloy 1100 and weighs about 169g. 
 
Figure 26: 200RPM, heavy duty 12V dc gear motor fixing bracket 
19 
 
2.10  Valve holding piece mounting screw 
Fixing of engine valves to the machine in order to lap them is another important task that has 
to be completed before the valve lapping process begin. This small screw is the first part of 
the unit designed to hold any king of valve. This mounting screw is fixed to the spindle of the 
200 rpm motor and one of the valve holding pieces or the extension piece can be mounted to 
this screw. This part is made from steel and weighs about 5g. 
 
Figure 27: Valve holding piece mounting screw 
2.11  40mm extension piece 
This extension piece is designed in order to the machine to be compatible with an engine 
valve which has a short overall length. When needed, the extension piece is assembled to 
the valve holding piece mounting screw and then the valve holding piece is assembled to the 
extension piece. This part also made from steel and has a mass of 65g. 
 
Figure 28: 40mm extension piece 
20 
 
2.12  Valve holding piece 
This is one of the most important parts in this machine. Most of the valve lapping power tools 
and valve lapping sticks doesn't have an effective valve holding unit. Due to that reason, 
sometimes while the valve lapping process is going on, the engine valve disconnects from 
the valve holding unit. This is a real inconvenience. To prevent that from happening, valve 
lapping machine for IC engines has a special valve holding piece. 
   
Figure 29: Valve holding piece alpha 
Shown in figure 29 is a valve holding piece that can be either assembled to the valve holding 
piece mounting screw or the extension piece. The head of this part is made from steel and 
body is made from natural rubber since natural rubber has the best elasticity of all rubber 
types. The head and the body is merged together using an industrial grade 
adhesive(Urethane or Methacrylate). 
Body of the valve holding piece is 40mm long. An engine valve can be fixed to the valve 
holding piece by using only 10mm. That gives a height adjusting space of 30mm for an 
engine valve. And when the extension piece is used, the overall height adjusting space is 
70mm. So the valve lapping machine is capable of lapping any engine valve with the overall 
height between 140mm and 70mm. 
 
Figure 30: An engine valve fixed to a valve holding piece 
21 
 
The specialty about these valve holding pieces are that there are 5 types of valve holding 
pieces designed to be compatible with a wide range of engine valves. Specifications for the 5 
types of valve holding pieces are obtained by analyzing over 300 valves made by different 
manufacturers such as Acura, Audi, BMW, Chrysler, FIAT, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mini 
Cooper, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota. The analyzing of engine valve data and 
categorization is included in appendix 1. Given below is the 5 categories of valve holding 
pieces and the stem diameter each category can handle.

There are 5 valve holding pieces designed for each of the category mentioned in table 1. 
Figure 31 shows those valve holding pieces.

Friction forces generated in static and kinetic status 
 
Ff = μ.N 
(3) 
Ff - Friction force acting on cam 
μ - Coefficient of friction 
N - Force acting on cam from the cam follower 
 
 
 
Let's consider a situation when the cam is moving(kinetic status) 
Coefficient of friction for steel on steel, μk = 0.6 [16] 
Ffk = μk.N 
Ffk = 0.6×52.86 
Ffk = 31.72N 
Torque at point A when the cam is moving  = TAk 
TAk = Ffk×0.027m 
TAk = 31.72×0.027 
TAk = 0.85644Nm 
TAk = 8.5644Kg.cm 
 
 
Let's consider a situation when the cam is not moving(static status) 
Coefficient of friction for steel on steel, μs = 0.7 
Ffs = μs.N 
Ffs = 0.7×52.86 
Ffs = 37.00N 
Torque at point A when the cam is moving  = TAs 
TAs = Ffs×0.027m 
TAs = 37.00×0.027m 
TAs = 0.9999Nm 
TAs = 9.999kg.cm 
As can be seen from above results, the maximum torque that has to be handled by the 
20RPM DC motor is 9.999Kg.cm . As the motor is compatible with torques between from 10-
19kg.cm, the motor and therefore the cam will work fine.

4     3D MODEL SIMULATIONS OF VALVE LAPPING MACHINE FOR INTERNAL 
COMBUSTION ENGINES 
This chapter includes stress, strain and displacement simulations of various parts of the 
valve lapping machine where  loads or torques are applied using finite element analysis 
methods. The point of these simulations are to examine the integrity of the structure of the 
machine before developing it and if any faults are found, to correct them and optimize. The 
parts and assemblies mentioned below will be analyzed. 
1. 20 RPM DC motor fixing bracket (loaded with 0.9999N.m torque) 
2. Tension spring (loaded with 52.86N force) 
3. Cam (loaded with 52.86N force and 0.9999N.m torque) 
4. Machine bed assembly 
 
Note: All the simulations are done using SolidWorks Simulations.

5  ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 
 
Design of valve lapping machine for internal combustion engines was a huge task to 
undergo since the designing has to begin from scratch. In this section the problems and 
challenges like alterations made to the design, failure of some structures when analyzed, 
problems with designing the valve lapping mechanism, ideas that came along while doing the 
design and the integrity of designs are discussed. 
After the project for design of valve lapping machine for internal combustion engines was 
approved the first challenge was to combine the existing calve lapping power tool and hand 
motion used when doing that same process by a valve lapping stick. The first design for 
calve lapping mechanism was a part that has a motor for valve lapping task and wheel to 
operate manually in order to move the motor vertically adapting the hand motion. Rack and 
pinion was used to convert circular motion of wheel to a vertical motion. Problem with this 
design was that since employing a rack and pinion made it a little hard for the wheel to 
operate and in order lap a valve, it needs a sensible system that minimizes the damage to 
valves, this way that goal could not be achieved. The implemented design was finalized after 
considering two other designs for valve lapping mechanism. The existing design of calve 
lapping mechanism was inspired by the valve operating mechanism of a internal combustion 
engine where valves open and close by a system implemented with valve springs, pushrods, 
rocker arms and a cam shaft. 
After finalizing the valve lapping mechanism, the next task was to design a structure to hold 
the valve lapping mechanism. Machine bed and machine stand was designed in this stage. 
Design of machine bed was quite easy while designing machine stand was very challenging. 
First design for machine stand included two adjustable arms to adjust vertical height from 
valve lapping mechanism to cylinder head and to adjust horizontal distance without moving 
the cylinder head. But that design was too heavy and little complex to be proceeded with. 
After giving much thought, a design of a solid machine stand was done and the horizontal 
adjustment problem was addressed by making the machine bed wider and vertical 
adjustment problem was solved by designing a 40mm extension piece. 
Simulations were done after finishing initial designs and structural integrity of machine stand 
was good and capable of handling the necessary load. But machine bed and cylinder head 
supports showed weaknesses. Stress concentration of some places were too much and 
showed a visible deformation loaded. These simulations led to new designs of machine bed 
and cylinder head supports. Following figures(figures 37, 38 and 39) shows simulations of 
stress, strain and displacement of initial designs of bed and cylinder head supports.

The vertical movement of valve lapping mechanism is done using a tension spring(function of 
tension spring is explained in the text). Calculations showed that the initial design of tension 
spring has a very high spring coefficient which cannot be operated using  the selected motor 
and could not reach the expected deformed status(15mm). Figure 40 shows the initial design 
of tension spring.

New design of the tension spring was done by considering all necessary factors like the 
torque range of motor, deformation range of tension spring and height of the spring. After 
finishing the design of the tension spring, calculations were done in order to make sure that 
the motor can handle the torque. These calculations included tension spring, cam and 
20RPM DC motor. According to the calculations, the maximum torque that has to be handled 
by the motor is 9.999kg.cm and the motor is capable of handling a torque range between 10-
19kg.cm . 
Design of valve holding piece was the most hard task. This design is an answer to the most 
common problem in valve lapping process. The problem is that the valve falls off from the 
plastic tube of power tool and also falls off from valve lapping stick. There were many ideas 
for this design and not one of them was simple and easy. So after discarding many designs, 
the final choice was to analyze few hundred valves used in different vehicle brands and 
categorize them by valve stem diameter. This way 5 valve holding pieces of different sizes 
were designed that will be suitable for any commercial automobile engine valve. 
After finalizing all the designs, major parts of the machine were simulated.
