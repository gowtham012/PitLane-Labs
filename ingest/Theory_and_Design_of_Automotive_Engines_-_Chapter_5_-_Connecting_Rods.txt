CONNECTING RODS
Definition: A Connecting rod is the link between the reciprocating piston and 
rotating crank shaft. Small end of the connecting rod is connected to the piston by 
means of gudgeon pin. The big end of the connecting rod is connected to the 
crankshaft. 
Function: The function of the connecting rod is to convert the reciprocating motion 
of the piston into the rotary motion of the crankshaft.  
Materials: The connecting rods are usually forged out of the open hearth steel or 
sometimes even nickel steel or vanadium steel. For low to medium capacity high 
speed engines, these are often made of duraluminium or other alluminium alloys. 
However, with the progress of technology, the connecting rods these days are also 
cast from malleable or spheroidal graphite cast iron. The different connecting rod 
steels are (4OC8, 37Mn6, 35Mn6 MO3, 35Mn6 Mo4, 40Cr4, 40Cr4 Mo3, 
40NiCr4MO2) etc. 
In general, forged connecting rods are compact and light weight which is an 
advantage from inertia view point, whereas cast connecting rods are comparatively 
cheaper, but on account of lesser strength their use limited to small and medium 
size petrol engines. 
Construction: A typical connecting rod is shown in fig1. A combination of axial 
and bending stresses act on the rod in operation. The axial stresses are product 
due to cylinder gas pressure and the inertia force arising on account of 
reciprocating motion. Where as bending stresses are caused due to the centrifugal 
effects. To provide the maximum rigidity with minimum weight, the cross section of 
the connecting rod is made as and I – section end of the rod is a solid eye or a split 
eye this end holding the piston pin. The big end works on the crank pin and is 
always split. In some connecting rods, a hole is drilled between two ends for 
carrying lubricating oil from the big end to the small end for lubrication of piston 
and the piston pin. 
 
3
Classification: The classification of connecting rod is made by the cross sectional 
point of view i.e. I – section, H – section, Tabular section, Circular section. 
In low speed engines, the section of the rod is circular, with flattened sides. 
In high speed engines either an H – section or Tabular section is used because of 
their lightness. The rod usually tapers slightly from the big end to the small end. 
 
4
Forces acting on the Connecting Rod: 
1. The combined effect (or joint effect) of,  
 
a) The pressure on the piston, combined with the inertia of the 
 
reciprocating parts. 
 
b) The friction of the piston rings, piston, piston rod and the cross head. 
2. The longitudinal component of the inertia of the rod. 
3. The transverse component of the inertia of the rod. 
 4. The friction of the two end bearings. 
Design of Connecting Rod: 
In designing a connecting rod the following dimensions are required to be 
determined. 
1. Dimension of cross section of connecting rod 
2. Dimension of the crank pin at the big end and the piston pin at the small 
end. 
3. Size of the bolts for securing the big end cap and  
4. Thickness of the big end cap.

Design a connecting rod for a semi diesel engine with the following data. 
Diameter of the piston = 88 mm 
Weight of the reciprocating parts = 1.6 Kg 
Length of the connecting rod = 30 cm = 300 mm (center to center) 
Stroke = 125 mm 
RPM = 2200 when developing 70 HP i.e. 52.2 KW 
 
= 3000 is possible over speed  
Compression ratio = 6.8:1 
Probable maximum explosion pressure = 35 Kgf/cm2 = 3.44 N/mm2
1. Cross section of the Connecting Rod: 
Since in all high speed engines connected rods, 
i. 
Lightness is essential in order to keep the inertia forces as small as 
possible and 
ii. 
Ample strength is required to withstand the momentary high gas 
pressure in the cylinder. 
Therefore, the I – section is generally found most suitable for this type of 
connecting rod. 
The connecting rod is under alternating tension and compression and since 
compression corresponds to the power and compression strokes, the compressive 
stress is much greater numerically than the tensile stress. The connecting rod is 
therefore, designed mainly as a strut. The inertia force due to change of motion of 
the reciprocating parts will be considered and checked later. 
In the plane of motion of the connecting rod, the ends are direction free at the 
crank and the gudgeon pins, and the strut is therefore, Hinged for buckling about 
“neutral axis” (x-x Axis) 
In the plane perpendicular to the motion plane (NA), (i.e. y-y axis) when buckling 
tends to occur about y – y axis, the strut has almost fixed ends due to the 
constraining effect of the bearing at crank and gudgeon pins. 
For buckling about y – y axis, 
7
The connecting is therefore 4 times as strong about y – y for buckling as for, the 
buckling about x – x due to constraining effect of the fixed ends. 
i.e. 4

The result is a convincing evidence of the suitability of I – section. 
It can be noticed that, a circular section connecting rod, is un-necessarily strong for 
buckling about the y – y axis. 
The proportions given in the figure are assumed for the section as representing a 
typical connecting rod. It is needed to check the relationship of the equation ------ 1.

(Problem No.1) 
Design a connecting rod for a petrol engine for the following data, 
Diameter of the piston (d)= 110 mm, length of the connecting rod(2L) = 325 mm 
Stroke length(L) = 150 mm, Speed (n) = 1500 rpm, Over speed = 2500 rpm 
compression ratio = 4 : 1, Maximum explosion pressure = 2.5 MPa. 
Solution: 
Step 1. Dimensions of cross section of the connecting rod:  
Let us consider an I – section of the connecting rod as shown in figure, with the 
following proportions, so that the connecting rod to be equally resistant to buckling 
in either plane, the relation between moment of inertia must be,

(ProblemNo.6) Design a connecting rod for a petrol engine for the following data 
Diameter (d) = 110 mm, Mass of reciprocating die of piston (M) = 2 Kg     
Length of connecting rod = 325 mm, Stroke length L = 150 mm, Speed n = 1500 
rpm, Over speed = 2500 rpm, Connecting rod = 4 : 1, Max. Exp. Pressure = 2.5

Solution: 
1. Stroke length = L = 150 mm 
2. Crank radius = L/2 = 150/2 = 75 mm 
3. n = length of connecting rod / crank radius = 325/75 = 4.33 = l/r

Design of small end
Force on piston Fp = lp dp Pb
23758.3 = 1.5 dp x dp x 10  
 
Fp = 23758.3 N 
∴dp
2 = 1583.9 
 
 
 
lp = length of piston pin 
dp = 39.79 ≅40 mm  
 
 
dp = dia of piston pin 
 
Pb = bearing pressure 
∴lp = 1.5 dp = 60 mm 
 
 
 
From Pg. 362 
l1 = K1d
d = dia of piston pin 
K1 = 1.5 for petrol and gas ends 
∴lp = 1.5 dp
from Pg. 362 
Pb = 12.4 for gas engine 
 
15.0 for oil engine 
 
15.7 for automotive engine 
Here we take, 
Pb = 10 MPa  
from Pg. 362 
 
Design of Big end 
Fp = lc dc x Pb
From Pg. 45 
Equation 3.17, 
Pb = 7.5 MPa     assume 
Also assume, lc = 1.25 dc
Where,  
dc = diameter of crank pin 
lc = length of crank pin 
Pb = bearing pressure  
Fp = force on the piston 
 
= 23758.3 N 
23758.3 = 1.25 dc x dc 7.5 
30
∴dc = 50 mm 
lc = 62.5 mm
