Abstract :- Cooling fins in IC engines remove excess heat from it to protect its components from thermal 
damages. These fins work on the principle of convection heat transfer. The cooling efficiency of the engine fins 
can be improvised by changing geometry, thermal conductivity and the material of the cooling fins. 
Computational fluid dynamics is the technique used to determine thermal stresses and temperature distribution 
through the fins. CFD analysis gives accurate and realistic results in comparison with physical analysis 
processes. This project is based on designing more efficient cooling fins for a 150 cc (Honda Unicorn) bike 
engine by improvising the design and the material of the fin. Where the modelling of the fin is performed on 
Creo modelling software and the CFD analysis is performed on ANSYS 15.0 Workbench software. 
Keywords: - Creo 3.0, ANSYS 15.0, CFD Analysis, Steady State, Transient State Heat Transfer.

INTRODUCTION  
Internal combustion engines are those in which the combustion takes place inside the engine cylinder, 
this chemical process of combustion generates very high amount of thermal energy up to 2500ºC. This high 
temperature is unbearable by the fluid film between various moving parts of the engine and the fluid film may 
evaporate. This temperature may also cause severe damage to various parts of the engine like piton, valves etc, 
as it generates very high rates of thermal stresses, to protect them from the damages the temperature should be 
reduced up to required working condition temperature of the engine. The reduction in the temperature is only 
permissible up to a limit, after the limit this temperature cannot be reduced further otherwise it may affect 
thermal efficiency of the engine. About 25-35% of the total generated thermal energy could be used into useful 
mechanical work and rest is rejected into the atmosphere. In this present work Honda unicorn 150cc bike is 
selected for thermal analysis. The Honda engine is having rectangular fins on the circumference of the cylinder 
and on engine head. This engine is made by aluminium alloy material. This engine design is modified by using 
holes of different sizes on the surfaces of the fin, different shape of holes having different effects on the heat 
dissipation capacity of the fin. To increase the heat transfer rate than the existing engine model the Aluminium 
alloy material has replaced by AL 6063 and Aluminium Nitride (ALN) and comparing the both used materials.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Related work is has been done on the Honda unicorn (150cc) bike model IC engine. There is continuous work 
going on for increasing the thermal efficiency and reducing the temperature of the engine.  
A research has been performed by KM Sajesh et al. Which shows the results that:- 
1. Turbulence of flow of air increased between the fins of hole. 
2. Temperature of fin can be reduced by creating holes on it. 
3. On increasing the surface area or increasing the diameter of the holes the cooling efficiency increases. 
 
A research has been performed by B N Niroop Kumar Gowd et al. and they concluded that:- 
Aluminum Alloy 204 with three other materials are considered which have more thermal conductivities 
than Aluminum Alloy 204 used, the materials are Aluminum alloy 7075, Magnesium Alloy and Beryllium. 
Thermal analysis is done for all the three materials. The material for the original model is changed by taking the 
consideration of their densities and thermal conductivity. By observing the thermal analysis results, thermal flux 
is more for Beryllium than other materials and also by reducing the thickness of the fin 2.5mm, the heat transfer 
rate is increased. The shape of the fin can be modified to improve the heat transfer rate and can be analyzed. 
 
Deepak Gupta et al. have designed a cylinder fin body used in a 100cc Hero Honda Motorcycle and 
modeled in parametric 3D modeling software Pro/Engineer. Presently used material for fin body is aluminum 
alloy fins and internal core with grey cast iron replaced with Aluminum alloy 6063 and Grey cast iron separately 
for entire body. The shape of the fin is rectangular; we have changed the shape with circular shaped. The default 
thickness of fin is 3mm; we are reducing it to 2.5mm. They have done thermal analysis on the fin body by

varying materials, geometry and thickness. By observing the analysis results, using circular fin, material 
Aluminum alloy 6063 and thickness of 2.5mm is better since heat transfer rate is better. But by using circular 
fins the weight of the fin body increases. So if we consider weight, using circular fins is better than other 
geometries. So they say Aluminum alloy 6063 is better, reducing thickness to 2.5mm is better and using fin 
shape circular by analysis and fin shape curved by weight is better. By observing the results, using circular fins 
the heat lost is more, efficiency and effectiveness is also more..

MODELLING  
The modelling of Honda unicorn 150cc bike engine is done on the CREO 3.0 software. CREO 3.0 is the latest 
PTC software used to design and modelling machine or machine parts more accurately then the previous PTC 
softwares. The modelling is done by putting the geometrical values by physical measurements of actual unicorn 
bike engine. Fig. 1 shows the model of Honda Unicorn (150cc) bike engine.

FIGURES AND TABLES 
It is clear from above literature that a lot of research work is going on thermal analysis and design 
modification of cooling fins of IC engines and still the future scope is available. In this research paper the 
thermal analysis is carried out on ANASYS 15.0 workbench and a comparative study is done between 
Aluminium 6063 and ALN materials for various diameter holes on the fins of 2mm, 6mm, 10mm and without 
hole. Figures show the results of thermal analysis of 150 cc Honda unicorn bike engine. Figures show results in 
all states with both designing materials which are Aluminium 6063 and Aluminium Nitride. Figure 1 and 2 
shows results about steady state and transient states of Aluminium 6063 and figure 3 and 4 shows results about 
steady and transient states of Aluminium Nitride material.

From table 1 the difference in temperature is clearly explained between AL6063 and ALN materials 
and from the graph it is clear that the ALN material is showing better cooling results than previously used AL 
6063 material. So that it is clear as per the design prospective the ALN material should be used to achieve better 
heat dissipating properties, with results better than previously used materials as Aluminium 6061, 6063 and 
other Aluminium alloy materials. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
We have implemented that the minimum temperature of the engine reduces on increasing the cross section 
area of the fins which is done by implanting holes on the fin surface. As the hole area increases the fin 
efficiency also increases. We also implemented the reduction in minimum temperature of the engine by 
implementing the material from AL 6063 to Aluminium Nitride (ALN) which is showing better and more 
efficient results than AL 6063. It has been seen that the implementation results in reduction in minimum 
temperature of the engine up to 20% in Aluminium nitride after improvising from Aluminium 6063. It is clear 
from CFD analysis that, to achieve better cooling results Aluminium Nitride is a better option than Aluminium 
6063 alloy material. It is also proved from experimental results that, on increasing the diameter of the hole the 
dissipated heat also gets increased. Fin with hole diameter 10mm has decreases the minimum temperature of 
741.18ºc for an imperforated fin to a minimum temperature of 707.43ºc
