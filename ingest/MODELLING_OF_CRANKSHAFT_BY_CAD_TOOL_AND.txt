ABSTRACT 
Crankshaft is the complex geometry in the Internal Combustion Engine with large volume 
production component. This converts the reciprocating motion of the piston in to a rotary motion. 
An attempt is made in this paper to study the Static structure analysis on a crankshaft. The 
modelling of the crankshaft is created by using Solidworks 16 Software. Finite element analysis 
(FEA) is uses to analysis variation of stress at critical locations of the crankshaft to use the ANSYS 
software. The results ofVon-misses stress on the crankshaft is 6.52Mpaand shear stress on the 
crankshaft is 3.367Mpa. The Theoretical results are obtained on von-misses stress is 10.99Mpa, 
shear stress is 2.9Mpa. Then approved of model is compared with the Theoretical and FEA results 
for Von-misses stress and shear stress are within the limits.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Crankshaft is the complex geometry in the Internal Combustion Engine with large volume production 
component, which converts the reciprocating displacement of the piston to a rotary motion. The crank pins 
to which the big end of the connecting rod are connected, there are crank arms or webs which connect the 
crank pins and shaft parts. In addition, the linear displacement of an engine is not smooth; as the 
displacement is caused by the combustion chamber therefore the displacement has sudden shocks. The 
concept of using crankshaft is to change these thrust displacements to as smooth rotary output, which is use 
in many devices such as generators, pumps and compressors. It should also use for a flywheel helps in 
smoothing the shocks. Crankshaft experiences large forces of gas combustion in engine. This force is start 
to the top of the piston and since the connecting rod connects the piston to the crankshaft, this force will be 
transmitted to the crankshaft. The magnitude of the forces depends on many factors such as consist of 
crank radius, connecting rod dimensions, and weight of the connecting rod, piston, piston rings, and pin.  
Combustion and inertia forces acting on the crankshaft. Torsional load and Bending load. Crankshaft must

be strong to take the downward force of the power stroke without bending, so the reliability and life of the 
internal combustion engine depend on the strength of the crankshaft. The crank pin is as a built in beam 
with a distributed load along its. Length that varies with crank positions. Each web is as like a cantilever 
beam subjected to bending and twisting. Bending moment which causes tensile and compressive stresses 
and Twisting moment causes shear stress on crankshaft.  There are many parts of failure in the engine, one 
of the most common crankshaft failure is fatigue at the fillet areas due to the bending load. On the moment 
of combustion, the load from the piston is transmitted on the crankpin, and causing a large bending 
moment on geometry of the crankshaft. 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Rinkle garg and Sunil Baghl. [1] Had constructed crankshaft model on Pro/E Software and then analysed 
on ANSYS software. As the maximum limits of stress, strain and total deformation reduced, there had 
improved in the strength of the crankshaft. The weight of the crankshaft had reduced .There by, reduces the 
inertia force. As the weight of the crankshaft decreased this would decreased the cost of the crankshaft and 
increase the I.C engine performance. 
C.M. Balamurugan et al [2] has been compare the fatigue performance of two competing 
manufacturing technologies for automotive crankshafts. Studied the Computer aided Modelling and 
Optimization of crankshaft. Namely use forged steel and ductile cast iron. The analysis performed in ansys 
software and the 3D model of crankshaft is created by the solid edge. . The new optimised geometry had 
compatible with the new engine. Without changing connecting rod and engine block. Fillet rolling and 
results in increased fatigue strength and reduced cost of the crankshaft. 
Gu Yingkui, Zhou Zhibo. [3] Have been using the PRO/E software to create and discussed the 3D 
model of diesel engine’s crankshaft. it shows that the high stress region mainly on crank arm, the main 
journal, the crank arm and connecting rod journal ,that why, the area most easily broken.

for the analysis ANSYS software is used and modelling software is solidworks. Maximum deformation 
appears on the crankpin neck surface and the maximum stress appears on crankshaft journals, crank 
cheeks, and near the central point journal. High stress appears in edge of main journal.

Introduction to FEA: 
The basis of FEA relies on the decomposition of the domain into a finite number of sub-domains 
(elements) for which the systematic approximate solution is constructed by applying the variation or 
weighted residual methods. In effect, FEA reduces problem to that of a finite number of unknowns by 
dividing the domain into elements and by expressing the unknown field variable in terms of the assumed 
approximating functions within each element. These functions (also called interpolation functions) are 
defined in terms of the values of the field variables at specific points, referred to as nodes. The finite 
element method is a numerical procedure that can be used to obtain solutions to a large class of 
engineering problems involving stress analysis, heat transfer, electro-magnetism, and fluid flow. 
ANSYS is general-purpose Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software package. Finite Element Analysis 
is a numerical method of deconstructing a complex system into very small pieces (of user designed size) 
called elements. The software implements equations that govern the behaviour of these elements and 
solves them all; creating a comprehensive explanation of how the system acts as a whole. The ANSYS 
Workbench environment is an intuitive up-front finite element analysis tool that is used in conjunction 
with CAD systems and/or Design Model. ANSYS Workbench is a software environment for performing 
structural, thermal, and electromagnetic analyses.  The Workbench focuses on attaching existing geometry, 
setting up the finite element model, solving, and reviewing results.  
Static Analysis:  Used to determine displacements, Stresses, Strain, Deformation etc. under static 
loading conditions in both linear and nonlinear static analysis. Nonlinearities include plasticity, stress 
stiffening, large deflection, large strain, hyper elasticity, contact surfaces, and creep. Apply Material for 
crankshaft (cast iron).
