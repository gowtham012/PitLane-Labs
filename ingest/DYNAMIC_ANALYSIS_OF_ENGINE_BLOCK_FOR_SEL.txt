concern for buyers, however the pricing is what we are 
looking forward to. Stay tuned for more updates on the

A cylinder block is an integrated structure comprising 
the cylinder(s) of a reciprocating engine and often some 
or all of their associated surrounding structures (coolant 
passages, intake and exhaust passages and ports, and 
crankcase). The term engine block is often used synony-
mously with "cylinder block" (although technically dis-
tinctions can be made between engine block cylinders as 
a discrete unit versus engine block designs with yet more 
integration that comprises the crankcase as well).
In the basic terms of machine elements, the various main 
parts of an engine (such as cylinder(s), cylinder head(s),

Abstract
A cylinder block is an integrated structure comprising the cylinder(s) of a reciprocating engine and often some or all of 
their associated surrounding structures. The term engine block is often used synonymously with "cylinder block".
One of the main components in an IC engine is the combustion chamber. The design of a combustion chamber has an 
important influence upon the engine performance and its knock properties. Design of a combustion chamber involves 
the shape of the combustion chamber, location of the spark plug and the position of the inlet and exhaust valves.
The Aim of this project is to design a combustion chamber using Pro-E and perform analysis using ANSYS software. 
The analysis of the combustion chamber is done by using different materials. By conducting the above analysis on the 
combustion chamber combustion rate, pressure and temperature gradient conditions are found and the best material 
for the combustion chamber is suggested.
Thermal analysis is conducted to find heat dissipation rate in engine block with the variation of materials Structural 
and fatigue analysis(dynamic) is conduct on engine block at working load conditions to evaluate and compare stress, 
strain, deformation and fatigue life with the variation of materials.
Frequency analysis is conducted on engine block with the variation of materials to evaluate frequency,
Using these values material selection will be done, the value should be nearby previous one (cast iron) maximum ac-
cepted variation value 65HZ.

crankcase) are conceptually distinct, and these concepts 
can all be instantiated as discrete pieces that are bolted 
together. Such construction was very widespread in the 
early decades of the commercialization of internal com-
bustion engines (1880s to 1920s), and it is still sometimes 
used in certain applications where it remains advanta-
geous (especially very large engines, but also some small 
engines). However, it is no longer the normal way of build-
ing most petrol engines and diesel engines, because for 
any given engine configuration, there are more efficient 
ways of designing for manufacture (and also for main-
tenance and repair). These generally involve integrating 
multiple machine elements into one discrete part, and 
doing the making (such as casting, stamping, and ma-
chining) for multiple elements in one setup with one ma-
chine coordinate system (of a machine tool or other piece 
of manufacturing machinery). This yields lower unit cost 
of production (and/or maintenance and repair).
Internal Combustion Engines:
The Internal Combustion Engine (also known as IC En-
gine) is an engine in which the combustion of fuel and 
an oxidizer (typically air) occurs inside a confined space 
called a combustion chamber. This exothermic reaction 
creates gases at high temperature and pressure, which 
are permitted to expand inside that confined chamber. 
Thrust produced by this expanding gas drives the engine 
creating useful work.
Engine classification:
Spark Ignition (SI) Engine: Inside the combustion 
chamber of this type of engine, the mixture of fuel 
and air is ignited by a spark plug to initiate the exo-
thermic combustion reaction.
Compression Ignition (CI) Engine: This type of in-
ternal combustion engine does not have spark plug. 
Inside the combustion chamber of this engine, air is 
compressed to a high enough pressure and temper-
ature that combustion occurs spontaneously when 
fuel is injected at the end of air compression.
Advantages and Applications
SI Engines
Lightweight
Low Cost
Suited for applications in smaller and medium sized auto-
mobiles requiring power up to about 225 kW (300 horse-
power)
Also used as domestic electricity generators and outboard 
engines for smaller boats
CI Engines
Suited for medium and large size mobile applications 
such as heavy trucks and buses, locomotives and ships, 
auxiliary power units (emergency diesel generators in in-
dustries) where fuel economy and relatively large amount 
of power both are required yet being noisy.
COMBUSTION CHAMBER:
 A Combustion Chamber is a part in which combustion 
of fuel or propellant, in particular, is initiated in internal 
combustion engine The combustion technology increases 
the inner power of a gas, that translates into a rise in 
temp, pressure, or volume reliant on the specification in 
an enclosure, for instance the cylinder of a repayment en-
gine, the volume is manipulated & the combustion cre-
ates a rise in pressure. In a constant flow arrangement, 
for example a jet-type engine combustor, the compression 
is initiated & the burning makes an rise in volume. This 
rise in compression or volume can be utilized to do work, 
for example, to push a piston on a crank or a engine disc-
type in a gas turbine.

CONCLUSION
This project works deals with “DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF 
ENGINE BLOCK FOR SELECTION OF SUITABLE MATE-
RIAL FOR COST & WEIGHT REDUCTION.”
Initially literature survey and data collection was done to 
understand methodology.
ENGINE BLOCK 3d model is prepared using CREO Para-
metric (pro/e).
Static, thermal, fatigue and dynamic analysis is done on 
ENGINE BLOCK using Cast Iron. Same has been done us-
ing aluminum and ZAMAK materials and to find out the 
failure locations and to evaluate results.
As per the Static, thermal, fatigue and dynamic analysis 
results, existing model is up to the mark only. Implemen-
tation of ZAMAK material will increase life. 
This project concludes that ENGINE BLOCK model with 
ZAMAK material increases the life and also weight will 
be reduced which interns increases the mechanical ef-
ficiency.
By reducing weight manufacturer can reduce cost of ma-
terial and machining.
