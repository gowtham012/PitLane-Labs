I. INTRODUCTION 
Crankshaft is among the largest components in internal 
combustion engines. It is employed in different types of 
engines, from small one cylinder lawn-mowers to large 
multi-cylinder diesel and petrol engines. Crankshaft is one of 
the most critically loaded components and experiences cyclic 
loads in the form of bending and torsion during its service life. 
This review is performed for optimization of crankshaft by 
considering various materials used for manufacturing of 
crankshaft, 
various 
manufacturing process 
used for 
manufacturing of crankshaft and opportunities available for 
optimization by various geometric changes in shape of 
crankshaft. Amongst all materials used for manufacturing of 
crankshaft the best material is selected and is manufactured 
by method which is most suitable and will reduce the cost of 
production. Crankshaft is one of the most important moving 
parts in internal combustion engine. It must be strong enough 
to take the downward force of the power stroked without 
excessive bending. So the reliability and life of internal 
combustion engine depend on the strength of the crankshaft 
largely. And as the engine runs, the power impulses hit the 
crankshaft in one place and then another. The torsion 
vibration appears when a power impulse hits a crankpin 
toward the front of the engine and the power stroke ends. If 
not controlled, it can break the crankshaft. 
Strength calculation of crankshaft becomes a key factor to 
ensure the life of engine. Beam and space frame model were 
used to calculate the stress of crankshaft usually in the past. 
But the number of node is limited in these models. With the 
development of computer, more and more design of

crankshaft has been utilized finite element method (FEM) to 
calculate the stress of crankshaft. The application of 
numerical simulation for the designing crankshaft helped 
engineers to efficiently improve the process development 
avoiding the cost and limitations of compiling a database of 
real world parts. Finite element analysis allows an 
inexpensive study of arbitrary combinations of input 
parameters including design parameters and process 
conditions to be investigated. 
Crankshaft is a complicated continuous elastomeric. The 
vibration performance of crankshaft has important effect to 
engine. The calculation of crankshaft vibration performance 
is difficult because of the complexity of crankshaft structure, 
the difficult determinacy of boundary condition. Dynamic 
matrix method and dynamic sub structural method combined 
with FEM were used to calculate the vibration of crankshaft. 
The method of three-dimensional finite element was carried 
to analysis dynamical characteristic of diesel crankshaft. 
In the project, 3-D finite element analysis was carried out on 
the modal analysis of crankshaft and the stress analysis of 
crankshaft to check the safety. The FEM software ANSYS 
workbench was used to simulate the analysis of crankshaft. 
The results of stress and deformation distributions and natural 
frequency of crankshaft were obtained by using ANSYS 
software. The experimental investigation also carried out for 
modal part and it validates with the FEM results. 
I.I Optimization of Crankshaft 
For optimization of crankshaft various studies have been 
made on material selection and manufacturing process of 
crankshaft, it is found Crankshafts are typically manufactured 
from forged steel, nodular cast iron and austempered ductile 
iron (ADI). When forged steels are compared to cast iron and 
alloyed ductile iron used in crankshafts, the fatigue properties 
of forged steels are generally found to be better that that of 
cast iron. Also it is found that by using micro alloy steel it is 
possible to reduce the cost of production. Therefore 
replacement of conventional crankshaft by forged steel shaft 
will also result in optimization of cost.  
Detailed dynamic load and stress analysis of the crankshaft 
investigated in this study was the subject of another paper. 
Finite element analysis was used to obtain the variation in 
stress magnitude at critical locations. The dynamics of the 
mechanism was solved using analytical techniques, which 
resulted in the load spectrum applied to the crank pin bearing. 
The load was applied to the FE model and the boundary 
conditions were defined according to the engine mount

design. The analysis was performed over different engine 
speeds and as a result the critical engine speed and critical 
locations on the crankshaft were obtained. Stress variation 
over the engine cycle and the effect of torsion load in the 
analysis were also investigated. Results from FE analysis 
were verified.

I.II Reasons of Failures Crankshaft  
The most common reasons for crankshaft failures are below:  
 Loss of effective lubrication. This can be due to 
contaminated lube oil, failed lube oil pumps, poor 
quality or incorrect specification lube oil.  
 Over speeding of engines, or long term operation in a 
critical or forbidden rev range.  
 Vibration loads on the crankshaft  
 Faulty crankshaft damper, designed to remove 
excessive vibration from the crankshaft. Failure of 
proper operation can lead to excessive crankshaft 
vibration and fatigue.  
 Engine power imbalance leading to fatigue failure, 
cyclic loading. This can be caused by poor 
maintenance or monitoring of engine power, or even 
poor quality fuel. 
 Hydraulic locking of cylinders, flooding of cylinders 
with cooling water. 
 Bearing misalignment, this can be detected early with 
proper crankshaft deflection measurement. 
 Design faults, a common problem as more licenses 
are passed out to new shipyards.  Incorrect or blatant 
ignorance of material compositions or poor 
manufacture of crankshaft can lead to early failure.  
 Overloading of engine.  
 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
C.M.Balamurugan, R.Krishnaraj, Dr.M.Sakthivel evaluates 
and compares the fatigue performance of two competing 
manufacturing technologies for automotive crankshafts, 
namely forged steel and ductile cast iron. In this study a 
dynamic simulation was conducted on two crankshafts, cast 
iron and forged steel, from similar single cylinder four stroke 
engines. Finite element analysis was performed to obtain the 
variation of stress magnitude at critical locations. The 
dynamic analysis was done analytically and was verified by 
simulations 
in 
ANSYS. 
Results 
achieved 
from 
aforementioned analysis were used in optimization of the 
forged 
steel 
crankshaft. 
Geometry, 
material 
and 
manufacturing processes were optimized considering 
different constraints, manufacturing feasibility and cost. The 
optimization process includes geometry changes compatible 
with the current engine, fillet rolling and result in increased 
fatigue strength and reduced cost of the crankshaft, without 
changing connecting rod and engine block.[1] 
Farzin H. Montazersadgh says in his paper that finite element 
analysis was performed to obtain the variation of the stress 
magnitude at critical locations. The dynamic analysis resulted 
in the development of the load spectrum applied to the 
crankpin bearing. This load was then applied to the FE model 
and boundary conditions were applied according to the 
engine mounting conditions. Results obtained from the 
aforementioned analysis were then used in optimization of 
the forged steel crankshaft. Geometry, material, and 
manufacturing processes were optimized using different 
geometric constraints, manufacturing feasibility, and cost. 
The first step in the optimization process was weight 
reduction of the component considering dynamic loading. 
This required the stress range under dynamic loading not to 
exceed the magnitude of the stress range in the original 
crankshaft. Possible weight reduction options and their 
combinations were considered. The optimization and weight 
reduction were considered in an interactive manner and 
evaluated by manufacturing feasibility and cost. The 
optimization process resulted in an 18% weight reduction, 
increased fatigue strength, and a reduced cost of the 
crankshaft. [2] 
Jaimin Brahmbhatt, Prof. Abhishek choubey suggested in his 
paper that a dynamic simulation is conducted on a crankshaft 
from a single cylinder 4- stroke diesel engine. A 
three-dimension model of diesel engine crankshaft is created 
using SOLID WORKS software. Finite element analysis 
(FEA) is performed to obtain the variation of stress 
magnitude at critical locations of crankshaft. Simulation 
inputs are taken from the engine specification chart. The 
dynamic analysis is done using FEA Software ANSYS which 
resulted in the load spectrum applied to crank pin bearing. 
This load is applied to the FE model in ANSYS, and 
boundary conditions are applied according to the engine 
mounting conditions. The analysis is done for finding critical 
location in crankshaft. Stress variation over the engine cycle 
and the effect of torsion and bending load in the analysis are 
investigated. 
Von-Misses 
stress 
is 
calculated 
using 
theoretically and FEA software ANSYS. The relationship 
between the frequency and the vibration modal is explained 
by the modal and harmonic analysis of crankshaft using FEA 
software ANSYS. [3] 
 The optimization options their combination under a set of 
defined constraints, a comparison between the original forged 
steel crankshaft and the final optimized forged steel 
component. The main objective of this analysis was to 
optimize the weight and manufacturing cost of the forged 
steel crankshaft, which not only reduces the final production 
cost of the component, but also results in a lighter weight 
crankshaft which will increase the fuel efficiency of the 
engine. Optimization carried out on this component is not the 
typical mathematical sense of optimization, because variables 
such as manufacturing and material parameters could not be 
organized in a mathematical function according to the set of 
                                                                                    International Journal of New Technology and Research (IJNTR) 
                                                                                           ISSN:2454-4116,  Volume-2, Issue-7, July  2016  Pages 83-94 
                                                                                85                                                                 www.ijntr.org 
constraints such that the maximum or minimum could be 
obtained. In this case of optimization process, the final 
optimized geometry has definitely less weight than the 
original crankshaft but this does not mean that the weight 
could not be reduced further. In other words, this may not be 
the minimum possible weight under the set of constraints 
defined. As the main objective of this analysis, it was 
attempted to reduce the weight and final cost of the 
component by changing the crankpin geometry, Increasing 
the oil hole diameter and fillet radius, increasing the oil hole 
depth and changing the crank web geometry. The method 
describes the first step in the optimization process to reduce 
weight of the component considering dynamic loading, which 
means that the stress range under dynamic loading should not 
exceed the stress range magnitude in the original crankshaft. 
The optimization process was categorized in different stages 
and paper concludes with the sufficient reduction in weight 
and ultimately cost.[4] 
Static analysis was conducted on a cast iron crankshaft from a 
single cylinder four stroke engine. Finite element analysis 
was performed to obtain the variation of the stress magnitude 
at critical locations. Three dimensional model of the 
crankshaft was created in Pro-E software. The load was then 
applied to the FE model and boundary conditions were 
applied as per the mounting conditions of the engine in the 
ANSYS. Results obtained from the analysis were then used in 
optimization of the cast iron crankshaft. This requires the 
stress range not to exceed the magnitude of the stress range in 
the original crankshaft. The optimization process included 
geometry changes without changing connecting rod and 
engine block. [5] 
The problem occurred in single cylinder engine crank shaft. It 
consists of static structural and fatigue analysis of single 
cylinder engine crank shaft. It identifies and solves the 
problem by using the modeling and simulation techniques. 
The topic was chosen because of increasing interest in higher 
payloads, lower weight, higher efficiency and shorter load 
cycles in crankshaft. The main work was to model the crank 
shaft with dimensions and then simulate the crank shaft for 
static structural and fatigue analysis. The modeling software 
used is PRO-E wildfire 4.0 for modeling the crank shaft. The 
analysis software ANSYS will be used for structural and 
fatigue analysis of crank shaft for future work. The material 
for crank shaft is EN9 and other alternate materials on which 
analysis will be done are SAE 1045, SAE 1137, SAE 3140, 
and Nickel Cast Iron. The objective involves modeling and 
analysis of crank shaft, so as to identify the effect of stresses 
on crank shaft, to compare various materials and to provide 
possible solution. [6]

 Von Misses Stress analysis 
For this project, fatigue is the main cause of crankshaft 
failure considered. Fatigue failure is defined as the tendency 
of a material to fracture by means of progressive brittle 
cracking under repeated alternating or cyclic stresses of 
intensity considerably below the normal strength. Although 
the fatigue is of a brittle type, it may take some time to 
propagate, depending on both the intensity and frequency of 
the stress cycles. 
Here in this project, the cyclic stresses play an important 
role to determine whether the component is safe from fatigue 
failure. The other criteria used to determine the safety are von 
Mises stress, deformation and number of life cycles, strain 
along with the stresses. This problem can be solved 
analytically by using the expression for fatigue Endurance 
limit of crankshaft& by the distortion energy method. 
Theory: 
Here calculations are done in order to obtain values for Gas 
Force, Bending Moment,Section Modulus and Torque. 
Finally all these values are used in order to calculate the Von 
Mises Stresses.

V. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS 
CATIA V5: 
CATIA is very powerful tool. You can harness this power 
to capture the design intent of your models by acquiring an 
understanding of fundamental concepts that define the 
software and why exist. This lesson discusses these concepts 
in detail. You should keep them in mind as you progress 
through this chapter. 
 Design Concepts: 
 You can design many different types of models in 
CATIA. However, before you begin your design project, you 
need to understand a few basic design concepts: 
Design Intent:  
Before you design your model, you need to identify the 
design intent. Design intent defines the purpose and function 
of the finished product based on product specifications or 
requirements. Capturing design intent builds value and 
longevity into your products. The key concept is at the core of 
the CATIA feature based modelling. 
Feature-Based Modelling: 
CATIA part modelling begins with the creating individual 
geometric features one after another. These features become 
interrelated to other features as reference them during the 
design process. 
Parametric Design: 
The interrelationships between features allow the model to 
become parametric. So, if you alter one feature and that 
change directly affects other related (dependent) features, 
then CATIA dynamically changes those related features. This 
parametric ability maintains the integrity of the part and 
preserves your design intent. 
Associativity: 
CATIA maintains design intent outside Part mode through 
associativity. As you continue to design the model, you can 
add parts, or electrical wiring. All of these functions are fully 
associative within CATIA. So, if you change your design at 
any level, your project will dynamically reflect the changes at 
levels, preserving design intent. 
The assembly consists of crank webs, crankpin and needle 
bearing. The parts that are mentioned are drawn separately as 
mentioned above and then with help of various constraints, 
they are brought together and assembled.

Crankshaft Materials and Properties of Coating Materials: 
The steel alloys typically used in high strength crankshafts 
have been selected for what each designer perceives as the 
most desirable combination of properties. Medium carbon 
steel alloys are composed of predominantly the element 
iron, and contain a small percentage of carbon (0.25% to 
0.45%, described as „25 to 45 points‟ of carbon), along with 
combinations of several alloying elements, the mix of which 
has been carefully designed in order to produce specific 
qualities in the target alloy, including hardenability, 
nitridability, surface and core hardness, ultimate tensile 
strength, yield strength, endurance limit (fatigue strength), 
ductility, impact resistance, corrosion resistance, and 
temper-embrittlement resistance. The alloying elements 
typically used in these carbon steels are manganese, 
chromium, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, cobalt, vanadium, 
and sometimes aluminum and titanium. Each of those 
elements adds specific properties in a given material. The 
carbon content is the main determinant of the ultimate 
strength and hardness to which such an alloy can be heat 
treated. 
In addition to alloying elements, high strength steels are 
carefully refined so as to remove as many of the undesirable 
impurities as possible sulfur, phosphorous, calcium, etc. and 
to more tightly constrain the tolerances, which define the 
allowable variations in the percentage of alloying elements. 
The highest quality steels are usually specified and ordered by 
reference to their AMS number (Aircraft Material 
Specification). These specs tightly constrain the chemistry, 
and the required purity can often only be achieved by melting 
in a vacuum, then re-melting in a vacuum to further refine the 
metal. Typical vacuum-processing methods are VIM and 
VAR. Vacuum Induction Melting (VIM) is a process for 
producing very high purity steels by melting the materials by 
induction heating inside a high-vacuum chamber. Vacuum 
Arc Remelting (VAR) is a refining process in which steels are 
remelted inside a vacuum chamber to reduce the amount of 
dissolved gasses in the metal.

Heating is by means of an electric arc between a 
consumable electrode and the ingot. There are other 
ultra-high-strength steels that are not carbon steels. These 
steels, known as "maraging" steels, are refined so as to 
remove as much of the carbon as possible, and develop their 
extreme strength and fatigue properties as a by-product of the 
crystalline structures resulting from the large amounts of 
nickel (15% and up) and cobalt (6% and up) they contain. 
These steels can achieve extreme levels of strength and 
maintain excellent levels of impact resistance. As far as I 
could determine, maraging alloys are not currently used for 
racing crankshafts but they have been used in certain extreme 
application connecting rods. In the high performance 
crankshaft world, the nickel-chrome-molyalloy SAE-4340 
(AMS-6414) has been a favorite in both forged and billet 
applications. It is used because of its very high strength and 
fatigue properties, coupled with good ductility and impact 
resistance at high strengths. SAE-4340 contains a nominal 40 
points of carbon and is often described as the standard to 
which other ultra-high strength alloys are compared. There 
is evidence that lower carbon content provides better impact 
resistance (reduced notch sensitivity) in certain alloys. The 
air-hardening nickel-chrome-molyalloy EN-30B is used in 
some high-end billet crankshafts, in both commercial and 
VAR forms. This alloy contains 30 points of carbon, and has 
a nickel content exceeding 4% (400 points). It has good 
impact resistance at high strengths and is often used in 
rock-drilling equipment and highly-stressed gears and 
transmission components. The fact that it can be air quenched 
to typical crankshaft core hardness is an added advantage 
because the distortions and residual stresses which result 
from oil quenching are avoided. Several manufacturers offer 
billet crankshafts in EN-30B. At least one US manufacturer 
of extreme duty crankshafts for NASCAR Cup, Top Fuel, 
Pro-Stock, early IRL, and other venues has selected a 
high-purity, lower-carbon version of the 43xx series of 
nickel-chrome-molysteels, a high-grade variant of E- 4330-M 
(AMS 6427). This material has a nominal 30 points of carbon 
and has become a favorite for oil drilling and jet engine 
components because of its very high toughness and impact 
resistance when heat-treated to high strengths. This 
manufacturer uses slight variations in the chemistry for 
different applications, but was understandably reluctant to 
discuss the variation specifics and how they affected the 
desired properties. The company maintains tight control over 
the entire process by purchasing its specific chemistry 
materials from a single, extreme-quality steel manufacturer, 
and by doing its heat-treating, cryogenic processing, 
ion-nitriding and high-tech inspection all in-house. The use of 
ion-nitriding allows the nitride process to be done subsequent 
to finish-grinding. The material which is currently viewed as 
the ultra-extreme crankshaft alloy is a steel available from the 
French 
manufacturer 
Aubert 
& 
Duval, 
known 
as 
32-CrMoV-13 or 32CDV13. It is a deep-nitriding alloy 
containing 300 points of chrome, developed in the 
mid-nineties specifically for aerospace bearing applications. 
It is available in three grades. GKH is the commercial purity 
and chemistry tolerance. GKH-W is the grade having higher 
purity (VAR) and tighter chemistry tolerance. GKH-YW is 
the extremely pure grade (VIM - VAR) and is said to cost 
twice as much per pound as the -W grade. 
According to data supplied by Aubert & Duval, 
fatigue-tests of the -W and –YW grades, using samples of 
each grade heat treated to similar values of ultimate tensile 
strength, show consistently that the -YW grade achieves a 
dramatic improvement (over 22%) in fatigue strength 
compared to the -W grade, and the endurance limit is claimed 
to be just a bit short of the yield stress, which is truly amazing. 
I have been told that, because of the extreme stress levels on 
Formula One crankshafts, most of them use the -YW grade, 
while the lower stress levels of a Cup crank allow the 
successful use of the -W grade. One well-known 
manufacturer (Chambon) has developed a process which 
allows the production of a deep case nitride layer in this alloy 
(almost 1.0 mm deep, as compared to the more typical 0.10 to 
0.15 mm deeplayer). They say this deeper case provides a far 
less sharp hardness gradient from the >60 HRC surface to the 
40-45 HRC core, which improves the fatigue and impact 
properties of the steel. It says that its deep-case process 
requires several days in the nitriding ovens, but the depth 
allows finish-grinding after nitriding, using a very 
sophisticated process to remove the distortions which 
occurred during the nitriding soak. No discussion of high-end 
crankshaft materials would be complete without mention of 
the ultra-high-strength alloy known as 300-M (AMS 6419). 
This alloy is a modification to the basic 4340 chemistry, in 
which a few more points of carbon are added (higher 
achievable hardness and strength), along with 170 points of 
silicon and 7 points of vanadium. The vanadium acts as a 
grain refiner, and the silicon enables the material to be 
tempered to very high strength (285 ksi) and fatigue 
properties, while retaining extremely good impact resistance 
and toughness. This material (300-M) is expensive and 
sometimes hard to get, since it is preferred for heavy aircraft 
landing gear components. It has been used by a few 
manufacturers for extreme duty Crankshafts and connecting 
rods as well as high-shock aircraft components. However, 
Several of the manufacturers I spoke with told me that they 
consider their favorite Materials to be much better than 
300-M for crankshaft applications.

Introduction to Finite Element Method (FEM): 
5.4.1 Basic Introduction: 
In mathematics, the finite element method (FEM) is a 
 
Experimental And Numerical Analysis Of Crankshaft Used In Hero Honda Splendor Motorcycle 
 
                                                                                        90                                                                                  www.ijntr.org 
 
numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to 
boundary value problems for partial differential equations. It 
uses subdivision of a whole problem domain into simpler 
parts, called finite elements, and various methods from the 
calculus of variations to solve the problem by minimizing an 
associated error function. Analogous to the idea that 
connecting many tiny straight lines can approximate a larger 
circle, FEM encompasses methods for connecting many 
simple element equations over many small sub domains, 
named finite elements, to approximate a more complex 
equation over a larger domain. 
1) Basic Concept: 
The subdivision of a whole domain into simpler parts has 
several advantages: 
 Accurate representation of complex geometry 
 Inclusion of dissimilar material properties 
  Easy representation of the total solution 
 Capture of local effects. 
A typical work out of the method involves (1) dividing the 
domain of the problem into a collection of sub domains, with 
each sub domain represented by a set of element equations to 
the original problem, followed by (2) systematically 
recombining all sets of element equations into a global 
system of equations for the final calculation. The global 
system of equations has known solution techniques, and can 
be calculated from the initial values of the original problem to 
obtain a numerical answer. In the first step above, the element 
equations are simple equations that locally approximate the 
original complex equations to be studied, where the original 
equations are often partial differential equations (PDE). To 
explain the approximation in this Comparative analysis of 
fatigue failure in single cylinder petrol engine process, FEM 
is commonly introduced as a special case of Galerkin method. 
The process, in mathematical language, is to construct an 
integral of the inner product of the residual and the weight 
functions and set the integral to zero. In simple terms, it is a 
procedure that minimizes the error of approximation by 
fitting trial functions into the PDE. The residual is the error 
caused by the trial functions, and the weight functions are 
polynomial approximation functions that project the residual. 
The process eliminates all the spatial derivatives from the 
PDE, thus approximating the PDE locally with 
 A set of algebraic equations for steady state problems. 
 A set of ordinary differential equations for transient 
problems. 
These equation sets are the element equations. They are 
linear if the underlying PDE is linear, and vice versa. 
Algebraic equation sets that arise in the steady state problems 
are solved using numerical linear algebra methods, while 
ordinary differential equation sets that arise in the transient 
problems are solved by numerical integration using standard 
techniques such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta 
method. 
In step (2) above, a global system of equations is generated 
from the element equations through a transformation of 
coordinates from the sub domains' local nodes to the domain's 
global 
nodes. 
This 
spatial 
transformation 
includes 
appropriate orientation adjustments as applied in relation to 
the reference coordinate system. The process is often carried 
out by FEM software using coordinate data generated from 
the subdomains. FEM is best understood from its practical 
application, known as finite element analysis (FEA). FEA as 
applied in engineering is a computational tool for performing 
engineering analysis. It includes the use of mesh generation 
techniques for dividing a complex problem into small 
elements, as well as the use of software program coded with 
FEM algorithm. In applying FEA, the complex problem is 
usually a physical system with the underlying physics such as 
the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, the heat equation, or the 
Navier-Stokes equations expressed in either PDE or integral 
equations, while the divided small elements of the complex 
problem represent different areas in the physical system. 
Comparative analysis of fatigue failure in single cylinder 
petrol engine  FEA is a good choice for analyzing problems 
over complicated domains (like cars and oil pipelines), when 
the domain changes (as during a solid state reaction with a 
moving boundary), when the desired precision varies over the 
entire domain, or when the solution lacks smoothness.

VII. EXPERIMENTATION 
 The experimental modal analysis (EMA) means the 
extraction of modal parameters (frequencies, damping ratios, 
and mode shapes) from measurements of dynamic responses. 
Basically, it is carried out according to both input and output 
measurement data through the frequency response functions 
(FRFs) in the frequency domain, or impulse response 
functions (IRFs) in the time domain. For mechanical 
engineering structures, the dynamic responses (output) are 
the direct records of the sensors. 
EMA has grown steadily in popularity since the advent of 
the digital FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) spectrum 
analyzer in the early 1970‟s (Schwarz & Richardson). In this 
paper, we will make FRF measurements with a FFT analyzer, 
modal excitation techniques, and modal parameter estimation 
from a set of FRFs (curve fitting). Experimental modal 
parameters (frequency, damping, and mode shape) are also 
obtained from a set of FRF measurements. The FRF describes 
the input-output relationship between two points on a 
structure as a function of frequency. Since both force and 
motion are vector quantities, they have directions associated 
with them. Therefore, an FRF is actually defined between a 
single input DOF (point &direction), and a single output 
DOF. FRF is defined as the ratio of the Fourier transform of 
an output response (X (ω)) divided by the Fourier transform 
of the input force (F (ω)) that caused the output (See Fig. 6.1). 
An FRF is a complexes valued function of frequency. 
Actually FRF measurements are computed in a FFT analyzer. 
 
Time and Frequency Domain 
Exciting Modes with Impact Testing 
Impact testing is a fast, convenient, and low cost way of 
finding the modes of machines and structures. All the tests 
were performed at the (name of your company), in the 
Mechanical engineering LAB, at LGMT - CRITT. The 
following equipment is required to perform an impact test:  
1. An impact hammer with a load cell attached to its head 
to measure the input force  
2. An accelerometer to measure the response acceleration 
at a fixed point & direction  
3. A 2 channel FFT analyzer to compute FRFs.  
4. Post-processing modal software for identifying modal 
parameters and displaying the mode shapes in animation.

X. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 
 In this project, the crankshaft model was created by 
CATIA V5 for modeling the crank shaft. Then, the created 
model was import into ANSYS software for static structural 
analysis. 
FEA Results for equivalent (Von-Misses) stress, shows 
that all selected material are below the limiting stress value of 
crankshaft and hence can be used for testing. Also the results 
of modal analysis FEA results match with the experimental 
and theoretical calculation for validation of model. The value 
of Von-misses stresses that comes out from the analysis is far 
less than material yield stress so our design is safe.  
The analysis of the crank shaft was done using five 
different materials. These materials are Alloy Steel 41Cr4, 
Titanium Alloy, Al Alloy, Zinc alloy. The comparison of 
analysis results of all five materials will show the effect of 
stresses on different materials and this will help to select 
suitable material for coating. 
Zinc Alloy can be used or coating can be done as it shows 
better results and also economically cheaper. Force analysis 
results also shows that it is having more stress bearing 
capacity. Induced stress is also less so it can be preferred.
