PISTON
Piston is considered to be one of the most important parts in a reciprocating 
engine in which it helps to convert the chemical energy obtained by the combustion 
of fuel into useful (work) mechanical power. The purpose of the piston is to provide 
a means of conveying the expansion of gases to the crankshaft via connecting rod, 
without loss of gas from above or oil from below. 
Piston is essentially a cylindrical plug that moves up & down in the cylinder. 
It is equipped with piston rings to provide a good seal between the cylinder wall & 
piston. 
FUNCTIONS: 
1. To reciprocate in the cylinder as a gas tight plug causing suction, 
compression, expansion and exhaust strokes. 
2. To receive the thrust generated by the explosion of the gas in the cylinder 
and transmit it to the connecting rod. 
3. To form a guide and bearing to the small end of the connecting rod and to 
take the side thrust due to obliquity of the rod. 
Nicholas August Otto, (German) Inventor of Piston (1866)

The top of the piston is called head or crown and parts below the ring grooves 
is called skirt. Ring grooves are cut on the circumference of the upper portion of 
the piston. The portions of the piston that separate the grooves are called lands. 
Some pistons have a groove in the top land called as a heat dam which reduces 
heat transfer to the rings. 
The piston bosses are those reinforced sections of the piston designed to hold 
the piston pin or wrist pin. 
MATERIALS: 
 
The materials used for piston is mainly Alluminium alloy. Cast Iron is also 
used for piston as it possesses excellent wearing qualities, co-efficient of 
expansion. But due to the reduction of weight, the use of alluminium for piston was 
essential. To get equal strength a greater thickness of metal is essential. Thus 
some of the advantage of the light metal is lost. Alluminium is inferior to Cast iron 
in strength and wearing qualities and hence requires greater clearance in the 
cylinder to avoid the risk of seizure. 
4
The piston made by the alloy of alluminium produces less inertia forces 
there by rotating the crankshaft more smoothly. The heat conductivity of 
alluminium is three-times that of cast iron and this combined with a greater 
thickness necessary for strength, enables an alluminium piston alloy to run at 
much lower temperatures than cast iron. As a result carbonised oil does not form 
on the under side of the piston and the crank case keeps always clean. SAE has 
recommended the following composition. 
SAE 300 : Heat resistant aluminum alloy with the composition, Cu 5.5 to 7.5 %,  Fe 
1.5 %, Si 5.0 to 6.0 %, Mg 0.2 to 0.6 %, Zn 0.8 %, Ti 0.2 %, other Elements 0.8 %. 
Advantages:  
1. Maintain mechanical properties at elevated temperature 
2. Heat conductivity about 4.4 times cast iron 
3. Specific gravity 2.89 
SAE 321 : Low expansion Alloy having the composition, Cu 0.5 to 1.5 %, Fe 1.3 %, 
Si 11 to 13 %, Mn 0.1 %, Mg 0.7 to 1.3 %, Zn 0.1 %, Ti 0.2 %, Ni 2 to 3 %, other 
Elements 0.05 %. 
Y – Alloy: (Developed by National Physical Laboratory, London.) it is also called 
alluminium alloy 2285. This alloy is noted for its strength at elevated temperatures. 
Also used for cylinder heads. Composition of Cu 4%, Ni 2%, and Mg 1.5%. 
CONSTUCTION: 
A piston is a cylindrical plug which moves up and down in the engine 
cylinder. It is attached to the small end of the connecting rod by means of a piston 
pin. Its diameter is slightly smaller than that of cylinder bore. The space between 
the piston and the cylinder wall is called the piston clearance. The purpose of this 
clearance is to avoid seizing of the piston in the cylinder and to provide a film of 
lubricant between the piston and the cylinder wall. The amount of this clearance 
depends upon the size of the cylinder bore and the piston material because the 
different metals have different rates of contraction and expansion when cooled and 
heat.

PISTON CLEARANCE: 
The two different metals having unequal coefficient of expansion which 
causes engine slap (piston slap). The space between the piston and the cylinder 
wall is called the piston clearance. This clearance is essential to provide a space 
for a film of lubricant between the piston and cylinder wall to reduce friction. The 
piston clearance is required for the piston to reciprocate in the cylinder. There are 
different methods to maintain the proper clearance to dissipate the heat from the 
piston. They are explained as below, 
1. Providing Heat dam: 
 
To keep the heat away from the piston skirt or lower part of the piston a 
groove is cut near the top of the piston as shown in fig. This reduce the path of 
heat transfer (travel) from the piston head to the piston skirt, there by cooling the 
skirt and preventing it from expanding in excess. 
 
Piston with heat dam

2. Providing slots: 
 
This method is used to control the piston expansion that is by providing slots 
in the lower portion of the piston. These slots may be horizontal, vertical or T-type  
as shown in fig. These slots reduce the path for the heat traveling from the piston 
head to the skirt. Thus the skirt does not become much hot and expands with in 
limit. 
Piston with T-slot 
3. Cam – Ground piston: 
The pistons are finished so that they are slightly oval when cold. These 
pistons are called Cam – Ground pistons. When a cam ground piston warms up, it 
assumes a round shape. Its area of contact with the cylinder wall increases. The 
minor axis of the ellipse lievin the direction of the piston pin axis. Due to providing 
the bosses for mounting the piston pin in the wall of the piston these is unequal 
thickness or amount of material with the piston wall. When heated there will be 
unequal expansion in the piston diameter which gives engine knocks. To overcome 
this difficulty the pistons are made cam ground in elliptical section instead of 
circular. 
 
8
4. Wire wound pistons: 
 
Some of the pistons such as split or cam ground type are provided with the 
bonds of steel wire between the piston pin and the oil control ring as shown in fig. 
There by controlling the expansion of the piston skirt to a certain limit. 
 
9
5. Autothermic Pistons: 
 
This type of pistons contains steel inserts at the piston pin bosses as shown 
in the fig. Mostly this piston is cam ground type and the low expansion steel inserts 
control the expansion of the bosses which are providing along the major diameter 
of the piston. 
 
Autothermic Pistons 
6. Bi – Metal pistons: 
 
This piston is made from two metals alluminium and steel as shown in fig. 
The skirt is made of steel in which alluminium is casted to form the bosses and the 
piston of the head. The steel has very small expansion when heated thereby 
obtaining a smaller cold clearance of the piston. 
 
10
7. Special pistons: 
 
The surface of the modern piston are anodized or treated with a coating of 
zinc oxide or tin. Anodizing is a treatment given to the surfaces of the pistons to 
resist wear in which the pistons also increase their diameters slightly thereby 
obtaining a close cold clearance. The special constructions control, the clearance 
as well as expansion of the pistons in addition to their own advantages. These 
pistons are oil cooled pistons, pistons with inserted ring carrier, cast steel pistons, 
tinned pistons etc. 
Piston temperature distribution:

Piston Production
The first machining operations on a piston of conventional design consists in 
center drilling the little boss generally provided on the piston head, facing the open 
end, and boring and chamfering that end. Most of the following opens are located 
from the center hole in the head end and the finished face and flange of the open 
end. A no. of turning facing and chamfering operations usually are performed in an 
automatic lathe in a single setting. 
 
The piston is located from the inside chamfer at the open end and 
supported by a revolving center mounted in a 4 in air operated tail stock ram. A 
locating spindle fixture stands extends in to the piston and drives it through the 
piston bosses. The skirt is cam turned to an elliptic form, from the center of the oil 
rings grooves to the open end, by carbide tipped tool in a cam turning attachment 
mounted on the carriage. This tool is mounted in a cam oscillated holder, the 
movement of which is synchronized with that of the spindle.    
Piston must have some desirable (properties) characteristics  
1. It should be silent in operation both during warm-up and the normal running. 
2. The design should be such that the seizure does not occur. 
3. It should offer sufficient resistance to corrosion due to some properties of 
combustion Ex : Sulphur dioxide. 
4. It should have the shortest possible length so as the decrease overall 
engine size. 
5. It should be lighten in weight so that inertia forces created by its 
reciprocating motion are minimum. 
6. Its material should have a high thermal conductivity for efficient heat transfer 
so that higher compression ratios may be used with out the occurrence of 
detonation. 
7. It must have a long life.

PISTON RINGS
Piston rings are fitted into the grooves of the piston to maintain good seal 
between the piston and the cylinder wall. 
Functions: 
1. To prevent the leakage of the compressed and expanding gases above the 
piston into the crankcase. 
2. To control and provide the lubricating oil between piston skirt and cylinder 
walls. 
3. To prevent the entry of lubricating oil from crankcase to the combustion 
chamber above the piston head. 
4. To prevent the deposit of carbon and other materials (matter) on the piston 
head caused by burning of lubricant. 
5. To provide easy transmission of heat from piston to cylinder walls. 
Materials: Piston rings are made of fine grained alloy cast iron. This material 
possesses excellent heat and wears resisting quantities. The elasticity of this 
material is also sufficient to impact radial expansion and compression which is 
necessary for assembly and removal of the ring. 
Types of Piston Rings: There are two types of piston rings. 
1. 
Compression rings or Gas rings. 
2. 
Oil control rings or Oil regulating rings. 
1. Compression Rings: 
Compression rings seal in the air fuel mixture as it is compressed and also 
the combustion pressure as the mixture burns. The top two rings are called 
compression rings Fig (a). They prevent the leakage of gases which are under 
pressure, from the combustion chamber to the crankcase. Figure shows the 
nomenclature of piston ring (compression ring). 
 
13
Piston ring nomenclature 
The outer diameter of the ring is some what longer than the cylinder bore 
and the split joint is open. 
 
Fig (a) Function of compression ring 
 
14
Compression rings may have tapered, chamfered, counter bored, scraper, 
plain or center grooved cross sections as shown in fig. 
 
Types of cross sections of compression rings. 
In modern engines there are two or three compression rings fitted into top 
grooves. The number of compression rings tends to increase the compression 
ratio. Generally the second and third rings are taper faced and supplied to improve 
oil sealing. In many engines, counter bored and scraper rings. 
Piston Ring Material: 
For piston ring we require a material which must be elastic (or resilient), 
have high ultimate strength, and have provided resistance to wear. Cast iron is the 
material which meets the requirements. Earlier some CI as used for cylinder 
blocks, but due to development and continued research special grades of Iron are 
developed. The typical specification is given for C.I  piston rings 
Silicon - 2.5 to 2.8, Sulphur - Not over 0.10, Prosperous - 0.5 to 0.7, Manganese -
0.6 to 0.8, Combined carbon - 0.6 to 0.8, Total Carbon - 3.5 to 3.8 
Elastic property is required to impart radial expansion and compression which is 
necessary for assembly and removal of the rings. Ultimate strength necessarily the 
amount with which it can exert necessary strength against the cylinder wall. 
Resistance to wear so that it may have satisfactory life. 
Stresses in Piston Ring: 
 
When a ring is inserted in the cylinder it is compressed to a radius which is, 
of course, the radius of the cylinder bore. If the ring is subjected to plain bending 
stresses, the compression on the inner fibers equals the tension on the outer fibers 
and is given by the relationship.

It is desirable to make the rings narrow, to reduce the loss of power due to friction 
between them and the cylinder wall and probably there will be less wear on the 
sides of the ring grooves. The disadvantage of having narrow rings lies in their 
delicate handling equipment. are used for top and second compression ring. 
During suction stroke the rings twist slightly due to the normal force produced by 
cutting away a corner of the rings. Thus as the rings move down they scrape off 
the oil that might have been left on the cylinder wall by the oil control rings. 
During compression stroke when the rings move upward, they tend to skate over 
the oil film on the cylinder wall. Thus less oil is carried up into the combustion 
chamber. During power stroke because of the combustion pressure the ring 
untwist and they have full face contact with the cylinder walls. During exhaust 
stroke the same action takes place as in compression stroke. 
3. Oil Control Rings: 
 
Function of Oil Control Rings 
16
Oil control rings scrape off excessive oil from the cylinder wall and return it 
to the oil pan. Some connecting rods will have an oil split hole which splits oil from 
the oil pan on to the cylinder wall during each revolution of the crankpin, for more 
oil reaches on the cylinder wall than is needed. This must be scraped off and 
returned to oil pan. Otherwise it will go the combustion chamber and burn. This 
burned oil would foul the sparkplug and increase the possibility of knock. One 
piece slotted cast iron type oil control ring has slots between the upper and lower 
faces that bear on the cylinder wall. The oil scraped off the cylinder wall passes 
through those slots in the back of the oil ring grooves in the piston and from there it 
returns to the oil pan. 
Why two Compression rings and One Oil Control ring? 
 
Usually two compression rings are fitted on the piston. During the power 
stroke the pressure increases and would be difficult for a single compression rings 
to hold this pressure. If there are two rings, this pressure will be divided between 
two rings. The loss of pressure past the upper ring is reduced. The load on the 
upper ring is also reduced so that it doesn’t press quite so hard on the cylinder 
wall. Wearing of ring and cylinder is also reduced. 
 
Because of two compression rings are necessary to withstand the high 
combustion pressure, hence these remains only one oil control ring. It is quite 
possible to use one oil control ring because of engineering and manufacturing 
improvements and the more effective action of the modern oil control ring. 
Piston Ring Gap: 
 
Piston rings have gap so that they may be installed into the piston grooves 
and removed when worn out by expanding them. The gap ensures radial pressure 
against the cylinder wall thus having effective seal to prevent leakage of heavy 
combustion pressure. This gap must be checked because if it is too great due to 
cylinder bore wear, the radial pressure will be reduced. To check this gap clean the 
carbon from the ends of the ring and then check it with feeler gauge. This gap is 
0.178 – 0.50 mm governed by the dia of the bore but if it exceeds 1 mm per 100 
mm of bore then, new rings must be fitted.  
17
The gap between the ring and the groove in the piston should also be 
checked by feeler gauge. This gap is usually 0.038 – 0.102 mm for compression 
rings and a little less for the oil compression rings. Wear in the piston ring grooves 
causes the rings to rise and fall during movement of the piston, so causing a 
pumping action and resulting in heavy oil consumption. Excessive gas blow by, 
loss of compression will also take place if this gap is too much.

PISTON  PIN 
Piston pin or gudgeon pin or wrist pin connects the piston and the small end 
of the connecting rod. Piston pin is generally hollow and made from case 
hardening steel heat treated to produce a hard wear resisting surface. 
 
There are three methods of connecting piston and connecting rod by the 
piston pin. 
1. The piston pin is fastened to the piston by set screws through the piston boss 
and has a bearing in the connecting rod, thus permitting the connecting rod end 
to swivel as required by the combined reciprocal and rotary motion of the piston 
and crank shaft. 
2. The pin is fastened to the connecting rod with a clamp screw. In this case the 
piston bosses from the bearing. A screw slot is made on the circumference of 
the piston pin in which the clamp screw is fitted as shown in fig.  
3. The pin floats in both the piston bosses and the small end of the connecting 
rod. It is prevented from coming in contact with the cylinder wall by two lock 
rings fitted in grooves in the outer end of the piston bosses and these rings are 
called CIRCLIPS as shown in the fig. This method is widely used. In this case a 
burning of Phosper Bronze or alluminium is used in the small end of the 
connecting rod. The bush develops very little wear and requires replacing only 
at long intervals. In very heavy loading of vehicles of CI engines, special care is 
taken to avoid risk of fatigue failure cracks. The external bearing surface is 
finished to a very high degree of accuracy to ensure correct fit in the piston and 
connecting rod.

Piston pin and connecting rod arrangement 
Design of a Piston for I.C Engines 
Introduction :
The design of I.C engine piston is probably more subject to controversy than 
any other machine part or engine mechanism, and any attempt to adhere to rigid 
rules of design may lead to failure in the first instance. 
 
The shape of the combustion chamber will fix the profile of the piston crown,  
While, the amount of distortion to be expected and the stresses due to gas 
pressure will be affected by the shape required. 
20
The rating of the engine and efficiency of combustion will affect the thermal 
stresses. 
The ratio of the connecting rod length to the crank radius will determining 
the amount of side thrust on the cylinder wall; While, Many factors including the 
bottom end design (the presence of balance weights on the crank and so on, will 
influence the no. piston rings and their type). 
Procedure : 
Piston Head or Crown :
The piston head or crown is designed keeping in view the following two 
main considerations, i.e. 
1. It should have adequate strength to withstand the straining action due to 
pressure of explosion inside the engine cylinder. 
2. It should dissipate the heat of combustion to the cylinder walls as quickly as 
possible. 
 The top of the piston may be considered as a flat, fixed on the cylindrical portion of 
the piston crown and subjected to uniformly distributed load of maximum intensity 
of gas pressure. 
The thickness of the piston top (head) based on the straining action due to fluid 
pressure is given by (1st condition)

GLOSSARY 
Bowl lip: Edge of the piston bowl as shown in the Figure .1.0. 
Compression ring groove: A groove cut into the piston around its 
circumference, in the upper part of the ring belt. The depth of groove 
varies depending on piston size and types of rings used. 
Compression height: dimension from the pin bore center to the crown 
excluding any dish or pop up, shown in Figure .1.0. 
Connecting rod length-Distance between the centers of the crank pin 
and piston pin bores. 
Cooling gallery: A cast channel in the piston ring belt area that receives 
cooling oil from an oil nozzle attached to a pressurized oil gallery. 
Dish or bowl: Recessed area on the crown. The dish adds clearance 
volume to the combustion chamber reducing compression ratio. The shape 
may also enhance combustion. 
Groove pound out-A widening of piston ring groove caused by the lower 
edge of the top ring gap embedded itself to the aluminum .conditions 
leading to groove pound out include groove wear ,high piston 
temperatures, and a lower silicon alloy to name a few. 
Major thrust face: That portion of the piston skirt which carries the 
greatest thrust load. This is on the right side when viewing the engine from 
the flywheel end with the crankshaft rotating counterclockwise. 
32
Minor thrust face: That portion of the piston skirt which is opposite the 
major thrust face. 
Oil ring groove: A groove cut into the piston around its circumference, at 
the bottom of the ring belt or at the lower end of piston skirt. Oil ring 
grooves are usually wider than compression ring grooves and generally 
have holes or slots through the bottom of the groove for oil drainage to the 
interior of the piston. 
Piston crown: Top of the piston. This surface also referred to as the dome, 
is part of the combustion chamber and some times includes a bowl, pop-
up, or valve pockets. 
Piston thrust side: The skirt side that absorbs the piston load on the 
downward power stroke. In engines rotating clockwise this would be left 
side when looking at the front of the piston. 
Piston crown valve pocket: A machined or cast recess on the piston 
crown to provide clearance to the open intake or exhaust valve. 
Piston pins :( Wrist pins or gudgeon pins) 
Connections between the upper end of the connecting rod and the piston. 
Pins may be held in one of three ways: 
1. Anchored in the piston with the bushing in the upper end of the 
connecting rod oscillating on the pin. 
2. Clamped in the rod with the pin oscillating in the piston. 
3. Full floating in both connecting rod and piston with lock rings or other 
devices preventing the pin from contacting the cylinder wall. 
Piston skirt taper - The difference between the diameters of the piston at 
the top of the skirt and at the bottom of the skirt with the diameters being 
measured in the thrust direction. 
Piston pin offset-refers to a condition where piston pin bore center does 
not intersect with piston axial center .pin offset towards the thrust side of 
33
piston can be used to reduce slap noise during piston cross-over in the 
cylinder bore.  
Ports: the inlet or exhaust ports allow air to flow into or out of the cylinder 
head. Run from the manifold face to the valves. 
Power: a measure of the rate at which an engine does work. Numerically, 
torque multiplied by engine speed, and expressed in horse brake power 
(bhp). 
Ring lands: Section of the piston that supports the piston ring forces. The 
width of these ring lands affects inters-ring volume. 
 
Skirt: The portion of the piston that provides the bearing surface for side 
load transfer to the cylinder walls. 
Top land: The ring land above the upper compression ring. 
Squish: action of forcing pockets of air within the combustion chamber 
back towards the spark plug for better fuel distribution. 
 
Stroke: the distance the piston moves up and down within the cylinder 
bore. 
Swirl: horizontal turbulent motion of air entering engine. Helps to give 
good fuel distribution and improve combustion. 
Under crown surface: The under side surface of the crown or dish.

The pin inner diameter can be found by equating ‘Z’ 
 
Requirements of piston pin are  
•
Adequate rigidity to keep stressing of the piston pin bore and pin 
bore support at an acceptable level. This rigidity consists of bending 
deflection and ovalization. 
•
Adequate rigidity to provide uniform bearing loads in pin bore area. 
•
Sufficient bearing area from the length and diameter to keep bearing 
pressure in the piston pin bore and connecting rod bore at an 
acceptable level. 
•
Light weight to reduce the effects of inertia forces. 
•
Good outer diameter and surface finish enhancing lubrication with 
piston and connecting rod mating surfaces. 
•
Adequate material and heat treat to provide structural strength and 
good wear characteristics [3].
