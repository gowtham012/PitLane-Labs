Abstract—This paper presents a model for the calculation 
of in-cylinder parameters in an internal combustion engine with 
a noncircular gear based modified crank-slider mechanism. 
With the introduction of noncircular gears, the instantaneous 
velocity of the piston can be accommodated to improve 
combustion performance. The displacement law of the 
noncircular gears is obtained using a B-spline curve, so that the 
appropriate instantaneous velocity of the piston is obtained. The 
gas pressure and temperature required for the determination of 
mechanical and thermal loads on engine components are found. 
The influence of the noncircular gears on the loads that act on 
all the components of the crank-slider mechanism, as well as the 
theoretical output torque for a given geometrical structure and 
inertial properties, are presented. To obtain the pressure and 
temperature inside the cylinder, under different operating 
parameters, such as air fuel ratio and spark angle advance, a 
Zero dimensional model is applied. The proposed mechanism 
enables the optimisation of the combustion cycle; therefore, 
greater power may be achieved.

I. Introduction 
Non-uniform rotation mechanisms are required in many 
applications. Noncircular gear wheels can be used to 
produce rotary motion with variable transmission ratio 
and, compared to linkages, provide a number of design 
advantages such as accurate transmission, ease of 
balancing, and compact size.  Furthermore, they are very 
versatile because of the great flexibility to obtain a desired 
transmission function. 
Research on noncircular gears has been very limited.  
Most of the research on these tooth bodies have 
concentrated on (i) the development of pitch curves for 
different applications or to satisfy specific requirements 
[1-9], as reviewed in the next paragraph; (ii) the 
development of new tooth profiles; and (iii) the derivation 
of mathematical models to describe and manufacture teeth 
of noncircular gears and their cutters.  Reviews on 
noncircular gears have been presented in previous works 
[9,10]. 
Classical applications of noncircular gears are found in 
automatic machinery, packaging machines, quick return

mechanisms, pumps, flow meters, and instruments.  New 
applications have also been reported. Doege et. al. [1] 
present a new press concept using noncircular gears in the 
driving mechanism. Dooner [2] and Yao and Yan [3] 
propose using noncircular gears to reduce any undesired 
torque and speed fluctuations in rotating shafts.  Fam et. 
al. [4] design a mechanical device consisting of a 
noncircular gear pair that acts as a variable-ratio 
transmission between an electro-mechanical actuator and 
a flexible structure. Han et. al. [5] design a noncircular 
front gear to maximize the mechanical power output of a 
driving system for a conventional bicycle. Dooner [6] uses 
a noncircular gear pair to achieve a two degree of freedom 
function generator. Librovich [7] uses noncircular gears in 
a torque transmission mechanism of a rotary vane engine. 
Voelkner [8] explains the advantages of using these tooth 
bodies in press-driving mechanisms in the metal-forming 
field. Vanegas Useche et. al. [9] develop a noncircular 
gear pair for minimising shaft accelerations of the driven 
gear. 
This paper proposes a novel modified crank-slider 
mechanism of an internal combustion engine, by 
introducing a noncircular gear pair. The noncircular tooth 
bodies enable to adjust the piston speed throughout the 
entire cycle, so that the performance of the engine can be 
improved. 
In spark ignition engines, the improvement of 
performance is constrained by the non-variability of the 
piston velocity law in accordance with the needs of the 
combustion process. With the introduction of a 
noncircular gear pair in the engine mechanism, the 
duration of the portion during which the non burned 
charge is subjected to high pressures and temperatures can 
be diminished. Thus, the knock tendency of the engine 
would be reduced. This modification also reduces the 
rejected heat. 
Since, to the knowledge of the authors, a mathematical 
model for piston velocity that optimizes the combustion 
process has not been developed, this work proposes a 
design for the displacement law of the noncircular gear set 
based on B-spline curves. These curves provide a 
powerful tool for designing displacement laws, because 
they give the designer a higher-level interface and the 
curve design is thus more intuitive. 
The primary input in mechanical design analyses is the 
data of the dynamic pressure of the cylinder. In the engine

design process, a predictive model for the combustion 
process has to be selected. For simplicity, a Zero-
dimensional or single zone model has been chosen in this 
work, in accordance with the approach found in Zhelezko 
[11]. With a Zero-dimensional model, the cylinder charge 
is assumed to be homogeneous in both temperature and 
composition. 
Models for in-cylinder thermodynamics and dynamics 
of the crank-slider mechanism are integrated in this work 
to configure a concise methodology for an easy simulation 
of an internal combustion engine. Based on this 
methodology, a computer program to analyze pressure, 
temperature, heat release, forces, and torques is 
developed. The program is written in the MathematicaTM 
software language. Results for an example case are 
presented, with an angular resolution of 0,25 degree of 
crank angle (2880 data points per engine cycle) and under 
steady operation conditions.  Finally, a noncircular gear 
pair is designed in order to optimise the operation of the 
engine. 
II. 
Thermodynamic modelling 
The first law of thermodynamics for engine cylinder 
systems states that 
 
dUs = dQ + dW                            (1) 
where 
dW = pdV 
dUs = mcv dT 
dT = d(pV)/mR 
R/cv = k – 1                               (2) 
 
where dUs is the change in internal energy, dQ is the heat 
added to the system, dW is the mechanical work done by 
the system, m is the working charge mass, cv is the 
constant volume specific heat, p is the pressure, V is 
volume, T is temperature, k is adiabatic constant, and R is 
the gas constant. 
Using the ideal gas law (neglecting the change in gas 
constant 
R 
and 
gas 
leakages), 
and 
after 
some 
transformations, the following expression for the heat 
release is obtained:

This is the traditional equation for the evaluation of the 
heat release, which can be inferred from Gatowski et al. 
[12] and Brunt and Platts [13]. 
For the average overall heat transfer from the gas to the 
cylinder coolant, convection type heat transfer equations 
are used:

Tg is the effective gas temperature, typically 800 °C  
Tcool is the coolant temperature, typically 80 °C  
hg is the film coefficient or heat transfer coefficient (W/

The heat transfer coefficient depends on the engine 
geometric parameters, such as the exposed cylinder area 
and bore, as well as the piston speed. The coefficient 
varies with location and piston position. In this research, 
to model the heat exchange between gas and cylinder 
wall, the Woschni equation has been used [14]. In this 
model, applied to the internal combustion engine, the 
equation has the form:

The combustion process is dealt with in accordance with 
the approach in Zhelezko [11].  
The combustion process starts with the spark ignition 
(neglecting the retarding period of the combustion 
process), point y in Fig. 1. During this phase, the pressure 
increases as a result of two factors: the geometrical 
compression and the heat release corresponding to the 
fraction of the mass burned [15].

The combustion heat release can be expressed in terms 
of the lower heating value of the fuel, Hi, and the fuel 
burning rate; the lower heating value can be found in fuel 
tables. The burning fuel rate is calculated as the product of 
induced fuel mass, mf, and mass fraction burned. The 
induced fuel mass can be calculated from the specific fuel 
consumption and maximum power at a given speed, while 
the mass fraction burned is estimated by a Wiebe function

In expressions (1) and (6), it is important to note that 
since the gas pressure in the cylinder is dependent on the 
piston displacement law, the heat release, and the heat 
losses, any variation in the piston displacement law affects 
the in-cylinder pressure and heat losses, which in turn 
affect the output performance of the engine.  Therefore, a 
manner in which the piston displacement law can be 
modified is needed. 
III. Noncircular gear based modified crank slider 
mechanism 
Nowadays big efforts are devoted to the improvement of 
the combustion process of internal combustion engines.  
Although combustion models have been refined, few 
movements have been made towards changing the piston 
kinematics.  In order to improve the performance of the 
internal combustion engine, a novel concept is explored in 
this work: the introduction of noncircular gears in the 
transmission of the engine. Figure 2 presents the 
schematic representation of the proposed modified crank-
slider mechanism that includes a noncircular gear pair.  
The driven gear rotates with the crankshaft, and the 
driving gear rotates with the power shaft. With the 
proposed modification, the curve of the piston speed can 
be defined as a function of the angle of rotation of the 
crankshaft, and it is not limited to the modification of the 
dimensions of the crank-slider mechanism.

Following Lagrangian analysis, as in [16], the vector of 
generalized coordinates of the mechanism is q = {ϕ, β, 
sp}T, where ϕ, β and sp are the angular position of the 
crank, the angular position of the connecting rod, and the 
position of the piston respectively. These and other 
variables are shown in Figure 3. Vector q gives the 
configurations of the mechanism. The constraint equation 
vector, f(q) = 0, is the set of equations that impose the 
geometrical constraints of the linkage mechanism:

IV. Displacement law design 
In this section, a noncircular gear set is designed. The 
gear pair is positioned between the crankshaft and the new 
output shaft with the aim of increasing the piston velocity 
before and after the top dead centre. This has the twofold 
objective of reducing the area of convective heat transfer 
during the main combustion period and enabling the 
compression ratio to increase beyond the limits imposed 
by the knocking phenomena to conventional engines.

Fig. 4.  Displacement law of the noncircular gear pair 
 
Figure 4 shows a displacement law of noncircular gears, 
where ϕ1 and ϕ2 are the angles of rotation of the driving 
and driven gear wheels, respectively.  This work proposes 
the design for the displacement law of the noncircular 
gear set based on B-spline curves. The objective of the 
curve designed is to obtain a higher piston velocity around 
the top dead centre. 
Figure 5 presents a comparison of the piston 
displacement curves of the conventional crank-slider 
mechanism and the mechanism proposed in this paper.  In 
the traditional mechanism (dashed line), the angular speed 
of the crank is considered constant and equal to that of the 
crankshaft. This produces an Sp-ϕ1 curve of sinusoidal 
form.  The coordinate ϕ1 represents the angular position of 
the crankshaft.

In the proposed mechanism with noncircular gears, it is 
considered that the angular speed of the crankshaft is

would be given by the product of the angular velocity of 
the crankshaft and the gear ratio. In this case, the 
coordinate ϕ1 represents the angular position of the 
driving gear.

Dynamic loads 
The primary input needed for mechanical design

thermodynamic model, the combustion process is 
considered to occur in the same displacement interval of 
the piston for both the conventional and modified 
mechanisms.

Fig. 7.  Torque in the engine for both conventional and modified 
mechanisms 
 
Considering an engine of 8 cylinders, the energy 
available in a thermodynamic cycle is 482 N m, for the 
conventional engine, and 498 N m, for the modified 
engine. Therefore, there is an increase of the energy 
available in a cycle. 
The curves for the pressure against ϕ1 for both 
configurations are shown in Figure 8. The pressure in the 
modified mechanism configuration is slightly higher than 
that in the conventional configuration.

Figure 9 presents the heat flux due to losses by 
convection at the engine. As may be inferred from Figure 
9, the magnitude of heat transferred to the combustion 
chamber walls has the biggest changes during combustion 
and expansion. With the modified mechanism, the 
behaviour of the heat flux has the same sharp rise as that 
of the conventional mechanism, but the maximum is 
followed by a more rapid decrease, resulting in a lower 
amount of heat loss.

Even though the amount of energy saved in this case is 
not impressive, an optimized design can be attempted to 
reduce further heat losses. 
In Figure 10, the noncircular gears designed are 
illustrated. The number of teeth of each gear is 40, and the 
pressure angle of the rack cutter is 30º.

VII. Conclusion 
This paper proposed a modified crank-slider mechanism 
of an internal combustion engine, through the introduction 
of a noncircular gear pair; the driven gear rotates with the 
crankshaft and the driving gear is coupled to the output 
power shaft. With these gears, the piston speed can be 
adjusted to obtain the desired performance of the engine.  
The thermodynamic and kinematic analyses of the 
proposed mechanism were presented. A noncircular gear 
pair was designed using B-spline curves, based on the 
optimisation of engine performance.  The results of the 
example presented indicate that the performance of the 
engine can be improved with the proposed mechanism.
