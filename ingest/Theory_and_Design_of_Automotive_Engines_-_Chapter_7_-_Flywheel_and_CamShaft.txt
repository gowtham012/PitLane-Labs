Flywheel
In a combustion engine, & especially in one with one or two cylinders, energy is imparted to the 
crankshaft intermittently, & in order to keep it rotating at a fairly uniform speed under a substantially 
constant load, it is necessary to provide it with a flywheel. 
In a single cylinder engine(4 Stroke), in which there is only one power stroke in two revolutions of 
the crankshaft, a considerable fraction of energy generated per cycle is stored in the flywheel, & the 
proportion thus stored decreases with an increase in the No. of cylinders 
In a 4 cylinder engine about 40% of the energy of the cycle is temporarily stored. 
However, not all of this energy goes into flywheel 
During the 1st half of the power stroke, when energy is being supplied in excess by the burning gases, 
all of the reciprocating parts of the engine are being accelerated & absorb energy; besides, the rotating 
parts other than the flywheel also have some flywheel capacity, & this reduces the proportion of the 
energy of the cycle which must be stored in the flywheel.  
In a 6 cylinder engine the proportion of the energy which must be absorbed & returned by the moving 
parts amounts to about 20%. 
The greater the No. of cylinders the smaller the flywheel capacity required per unit of piston 
displacement, because the overlap of power strokes is greater & besides other rotating parts of the engine 
have greater inertia. 
However, the flywheel has by far the greatest inertia even in a multi cylinder engine. 
Aside from its principle function, the fly wheel serves as a member of the friction clutch, & it usually 
carries also the ring gear of the electric starter. 
A flywheel used in machines serves as a reservoir which stores energy during the period when the 
supply of energy is more than the requirement and releases, it during the period when the requirement of 
energy is more than supply. 
In case of steam engines, internal combustion engines, reciprocating compressors and pumps, the 
energy is developed during one stroke and the engine is to run for the whole cycle on the energy 
produced during this one ,stroke. For example; in I.C. engines, the energy is developed, only during 
power stroke which is much more than the engine load; and no energy is being developed during suction, 
compression and exhaust strokes in case of four, stroke engines and during compression in case of two 
stroke engines. The excess energy developed during power stroke is absorbed by the flywheel and 
releases it to the crankshaft during other strokes in which no energy is developed, thus rotating the 
crankshaft at a uniform speed. A little, consideration will show that when the flywheel absorbs energy, its 
speed increases and when it releases, the speed decreases. Hence a flywheel does not maintain a constant 
speed, it simply reduces the fluctuation of speed. 
In machines where the operation is intermittent like punching machines, shearing machines, 
riveting machines, crushers etc., the flywheel stores energy from the ,power source during the greater 
portion, of the operating cycle and gives it up during a small period of the cycle. Thus the energy from 
the power source to machines is supplied practically at a constant rate throughout the operation. 
Note: The function of a governor in engine is entirely different from that of a flywheel .It 
regulates the mean speed of an engine when there are variations in the load, e.g., when the load on the 
engine increases it becomes necessary to increase the supply of Working fluid. On the other hand, when 
the load decreases, less working fluid is required. The governor automatically; controls the supply, of 
working fluid to the engine with the varying load condition and keeps the mean speed within certain 
limits. 
As discussed above, the flywheel does not maintain constant speed. It simply reduces the 
fluctuation of speed. In other words a flywheel controls the speed variations caused by the fluctuation of 
the engine turning moment during each cycle of operation. It does not control the speed variations 
caused by the varying load. 
Coefficient of Fluctuation of Speed 
       The difference between max. & min. speeds during a cycle is called maximum fluctuation of speed. 
       The ratio of the max. fluctuation of speed to mean speed is called coefficient of fluctuation of speed. 
Let

Camshaft 
 
A cam is a mechanical member for transmitting a desired motion to a follower by direct contact. 
The driver is called the cam, and the driven member is called the follower. The cam, may remain 
stationary, or translate oscillate or rotate whereas the follower may translate or oscillate. 
 
Types of Cams 
Cams may be classified in the following three ways: 
(i) Follower motion, 
e.g. dwell-rise-dwell (D-R-D); dwell-rise return-dwell (D-R-R-D) ; or rise-return-rise (R-R-R). 
(ii) Cam shape 
e.g. 
wedge, radial, globoidal, cylindrical, conical, spherical. 
 
(iii) Manner of constraint of the follower. 
Constraint may be obtained either by spring loading to keep the follower in contact with the cam 
surface, or by position drive. 
 
(i) Classification Based on follower motion 
 
(a) Dwell-rise-dwell cam. 
The zero displacement part of the cam is ca1led 
dwell. There is zero displacement followed by a 
rise contour, to another dwell, period, It is used 
very frequently in machinery, In this case rise is 
followed by a fall or it may be dwell-rise-dwell 
return. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) Dwell-rise return-dwell cam (D-R-R-D) 
In this type the rise and return are 
 
preceded & followed by dwells

(c) Rise-return-rise cam (R-R-R). 
This has no dwells .its application 
is limited. An eccentric mechanism is 
suggested in place of such a contour 
cam  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) Classification Based on the shape of the cam 
 
(a) The translation, wedge or .flat cam, 
This is the-simplest type of cam. The plate cam moves back and forth imparting a 
translatory motion to the follower. The follower could be held in the groove & thus has a positive 
motion. The follower could be held by a spring & the plate cut to give a desired motion with out 
any groove cut. The follower will in that case move on the surface of the plate.

(b) The radial or disc cam.
 
The position of the follower is 
determined by the radial distance from the 
cam axis. The follower is held in contact by 
spring, or gravity. (Fig B) 
 
In Fig.B1 &2, the difference is only 
of constraint. The follower has positive 
constraint. The radial type of cams are the 
most popular because of their simplicity 
and compactness. 
The cam shown in Fig.B1 is also 
called the yoke cam.  
The cam shown in Fig.B2 is 
conjugate supplementary or double disc 
cam. In this type, one roller is preloaded 
against the other. This imparts very precise 
motion. 
 
 
 
A particular type of radial plate 
cam called circular arc cam used in 
Automobile, has its contour composed of 
radii of circles. 
 
The spiral cam shown in Fig.B3 is a 
form of face cam having a spiral groove cut in 
it. Pin gear follower is driven by teeth in the 
groove; the follower velocity is a function of 
the radial distance of the groove from the axis 
of the cam. 
This cam is used in computers,

(c) The cylindrical or drum cam. 
It has a circumferential contour cut in the surface of the cylinder which rotates about its axis. The 
follower may translate or oscillate in the direction of this axis, Two types of cylindrical cams, one in 
which the groove is cut on the surface and roller has constrained positive motion: and the other in which 
the end of the cylinder is the working surface are shown in Figs C1 and C2, The follower in Fig, C1 is 
having an oscil1atory motion and Fig, C2 it is having translatory motion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(d) The globoidal cam, 
It is similar to the cylindrical cam. Convex or concave globoids, as shown in Figs.D1 and D2 
replace the cylinder. These cams, though of much academic interest have not been popular. These cams 
are used for indexing and other such purposes. These are used for much specialized application.

(iii) Classification based on constraint 
 
(a) Spring loaded or pre-loaded. 
In the radial cams of the types shown in Fig. A1, the follower is to be held by an external force 
provided by pre-compression of the spring or hydraulic load or gravity. The cylindrical cam shown in 
Fig. A2 is also a case of successful constraint.

(iii)  
(b)The cylindrical cam shown in Fig. B1, the globoidal cams shown in Figs. B2 and B3, and the yoke 
cams (Fig.B4) are all cases of positive constraint. No external force is; required to keep the follower and 
the cams surface in contact

Typesof Followers. 
 
Followers may be classified in the following 
three ways: 
(i) Construction of the surface in contact 
e.g. 
knife-edge, 
roller, 
flat-faced 
mushroom or special shape mushroom. 
(ii) The type of motion-translatory and 
oscillatory. 
(iii)Location of the line of motion, with respect 
to cam centre, radial & offset 
(i) Classification based on the surface in 
contact (refer figure 1) 
(a) Knife-edge, 
A sharp knife edge is in contact with 
cam. It is the simplest in construction, but of 
very little practical use due to the fact that 
extreme wear of the cam surface and the 
contact will take place. 
(b) A roller follower 
It is a cylindrical roller held by a pin to the 
follower assembly. At low speeds, a perfect 
rolling contact is possible, though some sliding occurs at high speeds. This type is very extensively used. 
Aircraft engines employ roller followers to limit wear at high cam peripheral velocities. 
( C)Mushroom follower. 
It may be flat-faced having perfectly flat plane. This 
causes high surface stresses. To minimise these stresses a 
spherical shape having a surface of large sphere radius is 
used. 
Automobile engines use flat-faced mushroom followers 
with spherical curvature in preference to rollers because of 
limited space and pin weakness. 
 
(ii) Classification based on type of movement 
(a) Translation. 
The followers shown in above Fig.1 are all translatory 
followers. The cam rotates uniformly and the follower reciprocates 
in the guides. 
(b) Oscillation. 
A uniform rotary motion of the cam is converted to a pre-
determined oscillatory motion of the follower which is pivoted at 
a suitable point to the fixed frame. 
 
(iii) Classification based on line of motion 
(a) Radial follower, (refer figure 1) 
Radial follower is one in which the follower translates along 
an axis passing through the cam centre of rotation. 
(b) Offset follower, 
Offset follower is one in which the axis of the follower 
movement is displaced from the cam, centre of rotation. The off-
set may be to the right or to the left.

Camshaft
 
The camshaft provides a means of actuating the opening and controlling the period before closing, 
both for the inlet as well as the exhaust valves. It also provides a drive for the ignition distributor and the 
mechanical fuel pump. 
The camshaft receives its motion from the crankshaft, from which all of the accessories also must 
be driven. 
In the case of passenger car engines these accessories usually include 
a fuel pump, 
an oil pump, 
a water pump, 
a generator, 
an ignition unit, and 
a fan. 
In cars equipped with hydraulic power steering a drive must be provided for an additional pump. 
On truck and bus engines there may be an air compressor, a governor, and a magneto in addition, 
though the latter item of equipment is now rarely found on road vehicles. .A drive must be provided also 
for the starting motor. 
The camshaft consists of a number of cams at suitable angular positions for operating the valves 
at approximate timings relative to the piston movement and in a sequence according to the selected firing 
order. There are two lobes on the camshaft for each cylinder of the engine; one to operate the intake valve 
and the other to operate the exhaust valve. A number of integral bearing journals support the shaft in 
bearings. Camshaft bearing journals are always larger than the cam lobes so that the camshaft may be 
installed in the engine through the cam bearings. To provide room for lubrication and metal expansion, a 
clearance of 0.05 to 0.125 mm is usually provided between the bearing journals and the bores. 
Usually there is an integral spiral toothed gear on the camshaft to drive the distributor and the oil 
pump. The fuel pump is operated from an integral eccentric or a bolt-on eccentric. In some cases, 
however, distributors are driven directly from the camshaft end. 
Endwise movement of the camshaft is limited by a thrust plate between the front bearing journal 
and the drive gear or the sprocket. This thrust plate is bolted to the engine. However, in some engines 
instead of the thrust plate, the same is achieved by the tapered spiral teeth of the distributor oil pump 
drive. 
 
Material 
 
The camshaft is forged from alloy steel or cast from hardenable cast iron and is case hardened. A 
typical cast iron alloy for a camshaft would consist of 
3.3% carbon, 
2% silicon, 
0.65 % manganese, 
0.65 % chromium, 
0.25% molybdenum and the remainder iron. 
In modern engines, cam lobes are ground with a slight taper across the face. The tappets used with such 
camshafts have spherical base and are slightly offset from the cam face. This provides tappet rotation and 
a wear pattern preventing edge loading which is a major cause of failure. Camshaft is supported in a 
number of bearings.

Camshaft drive 
The camshaft rotates at half the crankshaft speed so as to open and close the valves once in every 
two revolutions of crankshaft. 
In designing a drive for the camshaft and accessories of passenger- car engines, silence of 
operation is an important consideration. Most of the early automobile engines had a plain spur-gear drive, 
but in 1905 to eliminate the noise of poppet valves, it was found that, in order to achieve any real 
improvement, other sources of noise also to be eliminated as well, and so for the half-time shaft a 
toothed-chain drive was used. 
 
With increasing engine speeds the problem of reducing gear noise became constantly more 
urgent, and from 1911 on camshaft gears on the more expensive cars were cut with helical teeth, the 
pinion on the crankshaft at that time being made of steel and the gear on the camshaft of cast iron. Most 
truck engines still use such metal gears with helical teeth, while the majority of passenger car engines 
now have a chain drive, and those that have gear drive have one of the gears made of non-metallic 
material. 
The drive from crankshaft to the camshaft may be either chain drive or gear drive where camshaft 
gear or sprocket wheel is twice as large as the crankshaft gear or sprocket wheel. There are timing marks 
on the sprockets or gears of the camshaft and the crankshaft to ensure correct valve timing. In a chain 
drive a separate idler gear has to be provided. Moreover, a long chain drive tends to whip to avoid which 
a tensioning device is used, which may be a roller or spring-loaded steel strip or a rubber pad attached to 
a spring-loaded piston.

Gear drives, on the other hand, need no tensioner, but are noisy and are suitable only for 
camshafts mounted close to the crankshafts. Obviously gear is not suitable for overhead camshafts. 
The latest type of drive is, however, by means of a toothed rubber belt, which is made of rubber 
molded onto a non-stretching cord Such belts operating relatively silently, do not need any lubrication 
and are becoming increasingly popular for both petrol as well as diesel engines with overhead camshaft. 
Periodic tensioning checks are all that is required for these. 
Timing gears are made of cast iron, steel, aluminum or laminated fiber. Chains are made with 
links of alloy steel with ground and case hardened pins. 
Sprockets are made of nylon, aluminum, steel or iron. 
 
Oil Pump and Ignition-Unit Drive 
The ignition unit combines an interrupter and a distributor which must be driven at camshaft 
speed. A very common practice is to provide on the engine a shaft, either vertical or inclined, which is 
driven from the camshaft by helical 
gearing, generally located at the middle 
of the length of the engine, to the upper 
end of which shaft the ignition unit is 
secured, and to the lower end the oil 
pump. The drive at both ends is through 
an integral transverse key and slot. This 
arrangement has the advantages that it 
makes one drive do for two accessories, 
places the gearing where it is well 
lubricated and well protected against 
dirt, and brings the ignition unit into an 
accessible position at a minimum 
average distance from the spark plugs. If 
the shaft is arranged vertically the pump 
will be immersed in oil and will not 
have to lift it by suction, whereas if it is 
inclined the pump will be outside the 
crankcase and therefore more accessible. 
An ignition-unit and oil-pump drive for 
an engine in which the pump is outside 
the crankcase is shown in Figure.

Cast Camshafts. 
For many years camshafts were made exclusively of low-carbon steel and case-hardened on the 
cam surfaces, but during the early thirties one engine manufacturer began to use camshafts of cast iron, 
and the practice soon became quite general. 
Cast camshafts offer a number of advantages from the production standpoint. A material saving 
results from the use of patterns instead of dies in the production of the blanks, and if changes in design 
become necessary, they can be incorporated in the patterns much more quickly and with less expense 
than in the dies. With conventional cast camshafts the processes of copper plating, carburizing and heat 
treating are eliminated. Rough-turning of the cams and eccentric are unnecessary, these parts being 
finished directly by grinding. As a rule, no finish is allowed on the sides of bearings and cams, and on the 
shaft diameter. The material used is a superior grade of cast iron melted in the electric furnace. Originally 
both the cams and the journals were cast in chills and sufficiently close to size so that only grinding was 
required to finish them. These chilled surfaces are said to offer great resistance to wear than the case-
hardened surfaces of the usual steel cams. 
The use of numerous chills in the mold is troublesome, and it was later found that the necessary 
hardness on the cam surfaces can be produced without the use of chills. The cam surfaces are merely 
heated with a gas torch and air-hardened and large numbers of cast-iron camshafts are now made in this 
way. In one case where chilling is employed the iron used has the following composition: 
Total carbon, 3.30-3.65%; 
silicon, 0.45-0.55%; 
manganese, 0.15-0.35%; 
copper, 2.5-3.0%; 
chromium, 0.25% max.; 
phosphorus, 0.05% max.; 
sulphur. 0.06% max. 
These camshafts in the "as cast" condition show a Brinell hardness of about 300 on the bearings 
and 450 on the chilled cam surfaces. Where chills are used they must be accurately located, as the 
chilling effect does not penetrate very deeply, and if there are any material inaccuracies in. the cam part 
of the shaft, more material may have to be ground away on one side of the lobe than on the other, and all 
of the chilled material may be removed on one side. On the chilled cam surfaces a stock allowance of 
1/32-3/64 in. is made, and on the bearing surface, 1/l6 in. 
 
Camshaft Manufacture 
Camshafts of drop-forged steel, after being rough-turned, are cemented or carburized at the cam 
portions and then quenched from a temperature slightly above the critical point of the steel, so as to 
render the cam surfaces very hard and resistant to wear. To prevent carburization of the rest of the 
surfaces, the shaft is first copper-plated, and the layer of copper is then removed by machining where it is 
desired to carburize the surface. Carbon will not penetrate the layer of copper. Another plan consists in 
leaving those portions of the shaft which are to remain soft, over-size until after the carburizing process, 
and then turning off the carburized layer. 
 
Machining Camshaft 
All of the turning operations on camshafts with the exception of forming the contour of the cams 
are often performed in Lo-Swing lathes. With the proper tooling, all of these surfaces oil an average 
automobile camshaft can be turned in a minute and a half. 
With the attachment used with the Lo-Swing lathe for the spacing of the cams, the sides of the 
cams and the bearings are all properly spaced and faced, and any chamfering or necking operations are 
also performed. 
As high, as thirty-five and forty tools are used on a camshaft simultaneously. Of course, if all 
these tools were to act at once and all of them were to take the maximum cut, the shaft would be sprung 
so that it would be worthless. To overcome this, each slide carrying a set of tools is fed into the work a 
little ahead of the slide next to it. In this manner the tools in the first slide, for instance, will be through

their heaviest cutting by the time the tools in the second slide are ready to take their heavy cut, and so on 
to the third and fourth slide. 
After the camshafts are spaced and faced with this attachment, they are put back in the lathe and 
the portion between the cams is turned. Generally this is done with simple tooling, although all bearings 
and spaces are turned simultaneously, thus reducing the time considerably. 
 
Cam-Grinding 
It may be pointed out that cam-grinding machines designed to handle integral camshafts work on 
practically the same principle. The cam to be ground is secured on an arbor inserted into a spindle which 
carries the master cam at its other end. The spindle is carried in a head provided with an upwardly 
extending arm whereby it is swung from the body or frame of the attachment, which is clamped to the 
grinder frame. The swinging head is forced to one side by a coiled spring so that the master cam presses 
against a stationary shoe plate. The spindle carrying the cams is driven by a V belt from a jackshaft which 
in turn is driven by a belt from the headstock face plate. Only the hub of the V belt pulley on the spindle 
is shown in the drawing. To make the necessary allowance for wear of the grinding wheel, a set of 
different master-cam shoe plates are furnished with the attachment, which are inserted one after another 
as the wheel wears down, the plates having contact surfaces of different curvature; By means of this 
attachment it is possible also to cut the master cam from a template. A method of grinding the cam with 
the flat side of the wheel has been developed, whereby inaccuracies due to change in curvature of the 
grinding surface with wear are eliminated. 
To grind an integral camshaft it is necessary to first make a master camshaft with all of the cams 
correctly spaced angularly and longitudinally. This camshaft is driven in synchronism with the one to be 
ground, and acts on a roller carried by a cross slide carrying the grinding wheel, the roller being drawn 
against the master cam by a spring acting on the cross slide.
