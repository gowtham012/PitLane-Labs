Abstract— The most successful inventions of human includes internal combustion engine (I C Engine) as top of the list. The recent emphasis on 
fuel economy, pollution control and other automobile fields like low friction body profile has also stimulated theoretical searches for an 
automobile. Studies have found no alternative type that promises to have significant advantages in fuel economy or pollution control than 
conventional I C Engines. But from these studies, it appears that the conventional types of spark-ignition and Diesel engines will remain in their 
present predominant position in land and sea transportation and for industrial and portable power for the foreseeable future. And so, here is an 
approach to have combined design aspects for all basic I C Engine components in one paper. Design aspects includes components like, piston, 
piston rings, cylinder, cylinder head, connecting rod, crank and crank shaft, cam and cam shaft along with valve and valve gear mechanism. A 
paper can be the base for future detailed designing work of I C Engine along with stress analysis and simulation.  
Keywords- Internal combustion engine, piston, piston ring, connecting rod, crank shaft, valve gear mechanism.

 INTRODUCTION  
World needs transportation to fulfill most of the basic need 
either in the form of one or the other. Internal combustion 
engine comes under the radar from this point. It needs different 
kinds of fuels to work. From past to recent future, world is 
working in the field of I C Engine, its systems and for its 
betterment. The recent emphasis is on fuel economy and 
pollution control. Studies have found no alternative type that 
promises to have significant advantages in fuel economy or 
pollution control, and, above all, none that has nearly the all-
around simplicity, safety, and adaptability of present engines. It 
appears that the conventional types of spark-ignition and Diesel 
engines will remain in their present predominant position in 
land and sea transportation and for industrial and portable 
power for the foreseeable future [5]. Hence, here is an approach 
to present basic design of I C Engine. 
This paper can provide foundation for next detail design 
stages, where stress analysis based on thermal fundamentals 
and simulations are possible.

II. 
DIFFERENT PARTS OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE 
Principal parts of I C Engine are: 
i. 
Cylinder and cylinder head 
ii. 
Piston 
iii. 
Connecting rod 
iv. 
Valve mechanism 
v. 
Crankshaft and flywheel  
 
Cylinder of I C Engine contains the working fluid and 
guides the piston. Piston receives the gas load and transmits the 
load to the crankshaft through the connecting rod. The 
connecting rod transforms the reciprocating motion of piston 
into the rotary motion of crankshaft and the power is supplied 
to the necessary machine from the shaft.  
The main components of the reciprocating internal 
combustion engine are shown in Figure 1. Engine parts are 
made of various materials and perform certain functions, some 
of which will be explained: cylinder block (g) it is integral with 
crank case (m), both are made of cast iron. The piston (e) 
reciprocates inside the cylinder, which include the combustion 
chamber. Spark plug is for combustion to take place inside the 
cylinder block above piston. In compression ignition engine, 
spark plug is avoided as due to high compression ratio, the 
combustion inside the engine takes place.  
The piston is connected to the connecting rod (h) by piston 
pin (f). This end of the connecting rod is known as small end. 
The other end of the connecting rod called the big end is 
connected to the crank arm by crank pin (l). 
Camshaft (u) makes the cam (t) to rotate and move up and 
down the valve rod through the tappet (r). Mainly each cylinder 
has two valves; one is admission or suction valve and the other 
is exhaust valve [6]. 
The ignition system consists of a battery, an ignition coil, a 
distributor with cam and breaker points, and spark plug for 
each cylinder. In diesel engines there is an injection system 
instead of ignition system. 
Here we are not going in to much detail of two and four 
stroke engines as that is common fundamentals related to the I 
C Engines. 
III. 
DESIGN ASPECTS OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE 
A. Design Aspects of Cylinder[1,3,5,6,7]  
Cylinders are made up of grain cast iron as it is wear 
resistant and cheaper. For small size engines, the cylinder, 
water jacket and frame are made as single piece and liners are 
not used. But for large size high speed engines, they are used 
which can be replaced after wear and tear. Liners are made up 
of good grade of Gray CI, Ni, Chromium CI or NI-Cr Cast 
steel. Dry liners are heat treated after machining for hardness of 
RC 50 to 55 or above.  
There are two types of liners:  
1. 
Wet liners 
2. 
Dry liners.  
 
 
Wet liners have water in direct contact and are used in 
engine bore size 130 mm plus. Wet liners reduces the foundry

problem of casting the cylinder and cylinder is not subjected to 
thermal stress due to water in it, but it is difficult to replace wet 
liner from the cylinder as chances of water leakage in the 
combustion space and crank case.  
Dry liners are fitted in the cylinder wall and can be easily 
replaced as there is no chance of water leakage from jacket. 
The upper part of liner is cooled better with the use of dry 
liners, the casting of cylinder becomes complicated and heat 
flow through the composite wall of liner and cylinder is 
reduced [1].

Where, Pm is mean effective pressure, N is speed of engine in

Length of cylinder  = L+ clearance at ends  
10 to 15% clearance at both ends is considered generally. 
Hence, Length of cylinder= L+ 0.15 L 
 
Thickness of flange at lower end: 
Studs and nuts are used to attach upper half of crank case with 
cylinder. Here thickness of flange at lower end = 1.25 t or 1.25 
d to 1.5 d, where d is stud diameter. The distance between the 
stud centre and end of the flange is generally taken as 1.5d.

Where, n is number of studs or bolts, dc is core diameter of bolt

Minimum size of bolt should not be less than 16 mm for gasket 
joint. The pitch of stud or bolt is taken 20 √(d) to 25 √(d) 
mm. Hence, outer diameter of cyl. Flange = pcd of bolt + 3d

Cylinder head: 
Separate cylinder head is cased generally and connected with 
cylinder by the no. of bolts. The cylinder head accommodates 
valve mechanism, auto miser or spark plug depending on 
engine type. The cylinder head can be considered as circular

Where, C is constant and its value is 0.1, σt is allowable stress 
for CI head and its value is between 35 to 60 N/mm2. 
Maximum amount of heat is transferred through the cylinder 
head, so its thickness is taken sufficiently more. 
B. Design Aspects of Piston and Piston Rings [1,3,5,6,7].  
Function of piston in the internal combustion engine is to 
receive load of the gas and transmit it to the crank shaft through 
the connecting rod. It also disperses the heat of combustion 
from combustion chamber to the cylinder walls.  
The main components of trunk piston are piston crown, 
skirt, gudgeon pin and piston rings. Important design criteria 
includes, it should be high heat resistant and strong, weight 
should be minimum with sufficient bearing area to prevent 
wear, should effectively prevent the leakage of gases through 
the annular space around, dissipate heat as quickly as possible 
after combustion, hardness of material should be maintained at 
high elevated temperatures with noise less operation.  
In the name of materials, pistons are generally made up of 
cast iron, cast aluminium, cast steel or forged aluminium. They 
are different in rubbing friction, thermal expansion and 
contraction, density, strength and toughness along with other 
criteria [1].

The piston head can be considered circular plate fixed on 
the periphery with uniform pressure distribution while loading. 
Thickness equation is given where, P is maximum explosion 
pressure in N/mm2, D is cylinder bore in mm, σt is allowable 
bending stress in N/mm2. This thickness of piston is to be 
checked with heat dissipation. Hence, Heat absorbed by piston 
is equal to heat flow through the head from centre to the 
cylinder walls.

Piston Ring Design aspects: 
Generally 3 to 4 compression rings and one oil ring are used 
which are made up of CI having permissible strength of 84

Piston Barrel Design aspects: 
L is Length of barrel = D to 1.5D 
For ideal heat flow, thickness of piston barrel should be equal 
to the thickness of piston head tapering down to bottom.  
tb = thickness of piston barrel = 0.03D+ b+ 5 mm

Design aspect of ribs: 
No. of ribs to avoid the distortion of piston is provided. This 
distributes the gas load as well. This is provided below the ring 
section and extending up to piston pin boss and extending 
around the skirt. The ribs may extend across the head in some 
pistons. Generally 4 to 6 ribs are provided radially in the head. 
Thickness of ribs = th/3 to th/2 
 
Design aspect of piston pin or gudgeon pin: 
Usually full floating or semi floating pins are used to connect 
piston and small end of connecting rod. Fixed piston pins are 
never used as complete swinging motion of connecting rod will 
be confined to the small end bearing only and causing uniform 
wear. Piston pins is designed for maximum gas load or inertia 
force whichever is higher.  
 
Length of piston pin = 0.9 D 
Length of piston pin in the connecting rod bush is lp= 0.45 D 
Diameter of piston pin = dp 
Allowable bearing pressure = pb =  15 to 30 N/mm2 
Pmax=lp×dp×pb 
To reduce the weight of piston pin, it is made of hollow section 
where diameter ratio of inner to outer is maintained as 0.6. This 
piston pin is checked for bending assuming the gas load to be 
uniformly distributed.

The allowable bending stress for hardened steel is 84 N/mm2 
and 140 N/mm2 for heat treated alloy steel. Piston pin is 
subjected to double shear stress 
 
at the boss, so it is to be checked for shear stress, and allowable 
limit for the same is 50 MPa. 
 
Design aspect of piston boss: 
Inner diameter of piston boss  = dp 
Outer diameter of piston boss = 2dp 
Length of boss 
 
     = 0.2D 
 
Design aspect of piston clearance: 
Clearance between the liner and piston is provided for the 
allowance for thermal expansion. To ensure the necessary 
clearance in hot engines, the piston crown and skirt are made 
smaller by a value δD. 
 
δD = 0.005 to 0.007 D at crown in CI piston 
δD = 0.001 to 0.0013 D at skirt in CI piston 
δD = 0.006 to 0.01 D at crown in Al piston 
δD = 0.0018 to 0.0025 D at skirt in Al piston 
 
The clearance between the ring and groove wall is also 
important. And it is in compression ring is 0.7 to 0.95 mm and 
for oil scrapper ring it is 0.9 to 1 mm. This all clearance is to be 
checked under the hot state and hot condition which is not 
described here. Only important portion of inertia is described 
below.

C. Design Aspects of Connecting Rod Assembly[1,3,5,6,7].   
 
Connecting rod is a link between piston and crank shaft in 
the internal combustion engine. Generally they are drop forged 
from carbon steel or alloy steel. Carbon steel has ultimate 
tensile strength of 550 to 950 MPa. NI-Cr-steel is also used as 
one of the material. Cross section of rod may be circular, 
rectangular, I-section or H-section. Circular section is used for 
low speed and I-section is used for high speed engines. Length 
of connecting rod may be 4 to 5 times the crank radius. If 
higher ratios are used then angularity is increased which 
reduces wear due to side thrust. Lower ratio increased the 
angularity and hence the wear due to side thrust. Most engine 
have conventional two piece connecting rods, where bearing 
cap is cut off from forged rod and bolted in place for final 
machining. Generally I section is used in the connecting rod 
and hence the analysis is taken here for the same as sample.  
A connecting rod is a machine member which is subjected 
to alternating direct compressive and tensile forces. Since the 
compressive forces are much higher than the tensile forces, 
therefore the cross-section of the connecting rod is designed as 
a strut and the Rankine’s formula is used. A 
 
connecting rod subjected to an axial load W may buckle 
with X-axis as neutral axis (i.e. in the plane of motion of the 
connecting rod) or Y-axis as neutral axis (i.e. in the plane 
perpendicular to the plane of motion). The connecting rod is 
considered like both ends hinged for buckling about X-axis and 
both ends fixed for buckling about Y-axis. A connecting rod 
should be equally strong in buckling about either axes. 
 
Let, A is Cross-sectional area of the connecting rod, l is 
Length of the connecting rod, σc is Compressive yield stress, 
Wcr is Crippling or buckling load, Ixx and Iyy is Moment of 
inertia of the section about X-axis and Y-axis respectively, and 
kxx and kyy is Radius of gyration of the section about X-axis 
and Y- axis respectively.

This shows that the connecting rod is four times strong in 
buckling about Y-axis than about X-axis. If Ixx > 4 Iyy, then 
buckling will occur about Y-axis and if Ixx < 4 Iyy, buckling 
will occur about X-axis. In actual practice, Ixx is kept slightly 
less than 4 Iyy. It is usually taken between 3 and 3.5 and the 
connecting rod is designed for buckling about X-axis. The 
design will always be satisfactory for buckling about Y-axis. 
The most suitable section for the connecting rod is I-section 
with the proportions as shown in Figure below.

Since the value of Ixx and Iyy lies between 3 and 3.5, therefore I-
section chosen is quite satisfactory. 
 
The I-section of the connecting rod is used due to its lightness 
and to keep the inertia forces as low as possible. It can also 
withstand high gas pressure. Sometimes a connecting rod may 
have rectangular section. For slow speed engines, circular 
sections may be used. Since connecting rod is manufactured by 
forging, therefore the sharp corners of I-section are rounded 
off. Same way the force analysis on connecting rod can be 
presented where two forces are considered. One is force due to 
gas or steam pressure and inertia of reciprocating parts. Second 
is inertia bending forces. We can derive the expressions for the 
forces acting on different types of engine working under

D. Design Aspects of Crank Shaft Assembly [1,3,5,6,7].   
Crank shaft transforms reciprocating motion of piston in the 
rotary motion which consists of crank pin, webs and shaft. It 
may be of overhung crank type or centre crank type. May be of 
single or double throw type. The crank shaft is subjected to 
both twisting moment and bending moment hence it must have 
sufficient strength to withstand the forces. It is generally made 
up of 35 C steel or 40 C steel having ultimate strength of 525 to 
600 MPa. They are usually forged. 
A part of valve, valve gear mechanism which includes 
rocker arm design as well as timing, pushrod and cam design is 
omitted here as they are basically outer components of engine 
and work in connection to engine moment.

Width of crank web is b.

E. Design Aspects of Valve and Valve Gear Mechanism 
[1,3,5,6,7].   
 
Valve gear mechanism operates suction and exhausts valves 
and hence maintains air to fuel intake at desired time and hence 
compression and expansion strokes takes place at desired 
period of time. Also the remaining burnt product is exhausted 
before the next cycle is started. Component of valve gear 
mechanism for four stroke cycle engine are inlet and exhaust 
valves, rocker arms or levers, tappets or push rods, cams and 
cam shaft along with the transmission device from crank shaft 
to cam shaft. 
 
Design procedure of valve port and valve: 
Size of valve ports depends upon the cylinder bore and cylinder 
centre distance. Large valve is provided for large diameter 
cylinder. The size of valve port can be found as under:

Piston velocity=2LN/60 m/s. 
To maintain the flow, the pressure difference should not be 
high, so the gas velocity should not be high. Four automobile, it 
should be 50 to 75 m/s and for stationary engine, it should be 
40 to 50 m/s. Here from the equation, area of port can be found 
and from that diameter of port can be found out in mm. For 
higher engine output, inlet port is made about 30 to 40 mm 
larger than exhaust port. Valve stem diameter is indicated by ds 
and valve seat is grinded with the angle of 45º normally. 
Generally poppet type valves are used in I c engine. Main part 
of valve is stem, head and face. For better performance of 
engine, opening and closing of valves should be done at perfect 
timing. Also valve should be tight on their seats to prevent any 
leakage while in close condition. Along with this, the weight of 
valve should be as light as possible to have flexibility in 
operation and reduce the working forces. 
For flat headed valve, valve lift l 
= 
dp0/4  
For conical valves, valve lift l 
= 
dp0/4cosα 
Where usually α = 45 degree for exhaust and 30 degree for inlet 
valve. 
Diameter of valve head dv  
= 
dp0 to 1.16 dp0 
 
Thickness of valve head can be obtained by considering it as 
flat plate subjected to maximum uniform distributed gas load.

Rocker arm transmits the motion from crankshaft to the valves. 
The force required to operate the inlet valve is comparatively 
less than that required to operate the exhaust valve. In practice 
both the rocker arms operating inlet valve and exhaust valve 
are made of same size for uniformity.  
Maximum load on the valve during acceleration comprises of 
gas load, initial spring force to hold on its seat against suction 
stroke and valve inertia.  
 
Gas load =Area of valve(which is π/4dv
2)× exhaust pressure (P) 
Exhaust pressure is generally 0.35 to 0.4 MPa. 
Initial spring force = Valve area× Vacuum pressure 
Vacuum pressure varies from 0.02 to 0.03 MPa for diesel eng. 
Vacuum pressure varies from 0.05 to 0.07 MPa for petrol eng. 
Inertia of valve = Mass of valve× Acceleration. 
The design mass of valve is referred to the area of passage 
through the throat of the valve and reduces to its axis or it is the 
equivalent mass of valve gear referred to the valve axis. 
Empirically it can be found as under: 
Mass of valve = m = 230× (port area in m2)= 230×(π/4 dp0
2) in 
kgs. Diameter here should be in meter.  
 
The acceleration of valve is found as under: 
Valve total opening angle  =180+angle of EVO before BDC+  
angle of EVC after TDC 
= 180+ α+β

Where, ω=2π(N/2)/60 rad/s and Cam shaft speed is half that of

Design aspects of rocker arm: 
The rocker arm may be straight or angular with an included 
angle of 135 to 160 degree. 
Arm length, X=5 times valve lift and Y=0.9 to 1X. 
Allowable stress for caste steel is 50 to 60MPa and for forged 
steel is 60 to 70MPa. 
Cross section of rocker arm is rectangular or I section 
generally. 
For rectangular section: 
h 
= 
3b  
For I-section: Flanges=2.5t×t, Depth= 6t, Web= 4t×t 
Now maximum bending moment on the arm, M=P×X=σbZ 
Where, P is total force acting at the valve end and X is leverage 
of arm. Z=1/6bh2 for rectangular section and I/y for I-section.

Then, R = ldpPb 
The allowable pressure is 10 to 18MPa and the ratio l/dp is 
usually taken as 1.25 to 1.5. So through this, pin diameter can 
be determined. Hub of rocker arm is fitted with brass bush.  
Hence inner diameter of hub= di = dp+2 × bush thickness. 
Thickness of brass bush usually taken as 2 to 3 mm and outer 
diameter of hub is 2di. Checking of hub under bending with 
following equation and bending stress can be found out.

inner diameter 0.6 times outer diameter. Euler’s equation or 
rankine equation is used for l/k<80 for CI and l/k<100 for steel.

Where, a=I/7500 for steel, l is length of push rod and σc is 
allowable stress for push rod material. 
Push rod is made up of bright drawn mild steel with 0.4% 
carbon content. Allowable stress is 65 to 75MPa.  
Design of valve spring is done in usual manner as compression 
spring. Function of spring is to provide spring force for the 
closure of the valve and to maintain contact of cam with the 
follower all the times. In the excessive surging of spring, as in 
high speed engine, the follower may leave the contact of cam. 
 
Whal factor = k = (4c-1/4c-4)+(0.615/c), Where, C= spring 
index

Maximum load on the valve is the load when valve is opened. 
Pmax = D/2 = πdw3τ/16k 
When valve is closed, load on spring is minimum. The 
allowable shear stress for carbon steel spring is 280 to 320MPa.

solid length added to deflection and clearance. 
 
Design aspects of cam: 
Cam is integral part of the cam shaft. In this case following are 
the calculation, 
Diameter of cam shaft = 0.16D+12.5mm [D=bore diameter] 
If the cam is keyed on the cam shaft, then 
Diameter of cam shaft = 1.175D+20mm 
Base circle diameter    = cam shaft dia.+3mm for integral cam 
  
 
        = 1.5×shaft dia.+20 mm for keyed cam 
Usually roller follower is used with cam.  
Diameter of roller        = 0.5 to 0.75 × cam shaft diameter 
Width of follower        = 0.3×roller diameter 
Width of cam = 0.09D+6 mm to 0.11D+12 mm 
However the width of cam depends upon the load acting on it.  
 
If the cam is well lubricated, then the cam width is determined 
a sunder.

If cam is face hardened then, it can sustain load of 200N to 
250N per mm width. 
For plain carbon steel cam, it can sustain a load of 100N to 
150N per mm width.  
From the given valve lift and given angles of action, the ca can 
be designed. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The work is base approach to have design of different I C 
Engine and its components. No thermal or other considerations 
are taken in to account while designing. We have designed 
different components like piston, piston rings, cylinder, 
cylinder head, connecting rod, crank and crank shaft, cam and 
cam shaft along with valve and valve gear mechanism. Purpose 
of the paper is to better understanding of different design 
parameters and systems in integration to design with certain 
assumptions as mentioned in different sections. Expected 
outcome of this work is to have integration between design 
parameters and systems. Same way any existing or new single 
cylinder engine can be designed, thermal considerations can be 
approached and a simulation of the engine can be workout. For 
safer limits, certain stress limits have been assumed which can 
be change as per the material selection and data can be drawn 
from design data book.
