RECIPROCATING INTERNAL
 COMBUSTION ENGINES
6.1 Introduction
Perhaps the best-known engine in the world is the reciprocating internal combustion
(IC) engine. Virtually every person who has driven an automobile or pushed a power
lawnmower has used one. By far the most widely used IC engine is the spark-ignition
gasoline engine, which takes us to school and work and on pleasure jaunts. Although
others had made significant contributions, Niklaus Otto is generally credited with  the
invention of the engine and with the statement of its theoretical cycle.
     Another important engine is the reciprocating engine that made the name of Rudolf
Diesel famous. The Diesel engine, the workhorse of the heavy truck industry, is widely
used in industrial power and marine applications. It replaced the reciprocating steam
engine in railroad locomotives about fifty years ago and remains dominant in that role
today.
     The piston, cylinder, crank, and connecting rod provide the geometric basis of the
reciprocating engine. While two-stroke-cycle engines are in use and of continuing
interest, the discussion here will emphasize the more widely applied four-stroke-cycle
engine. In this engine the piston undergoes two mechanical cycles for each
thermodynamic cycle. The intake and compression processes occur in the first two
strokes, and the power and exhaust processes in the last two. These processes are made
possible by the crank-slider mechanism, discussed next. 
6.2 The Crank-Slider Mechanism
Common to most reciprocating engines is a linkage known as a crank-slider mechan-
ism. Diagramed in Figure 6.1, this mechanism is one of several capable of producing
the straight-line, backward-and-forward motion known as reciprocating. Fundament-
ally, the crank-slider converts rotational motion into linear motion, or vice-versa. With
a piston as the slider moving inside a fixed cylinder, the mechanism provides the vital
capability of a gas engine: the ability to compress and expand a gas. Before delving into
this aspect of the engine, however, let us examine the crank-slider mechanism more
closely.
225
It is evident from Figure 6.2 that, while the crank arm rotates through 180°, the
piston moves from the position known as top-center (TC) to the other extreme, called
bottom-center (BC). During this period the piston travels a distance, S, called the
stroke, that is twice the length of the crank. 
For an angular velocity of the crank, , the crank pin A has a tangential velocity
component S/2. It is evident that, at TC and at BC, the crank pin velocity component
in the piston direction, and hence the piston velocity, is zero. At these points,
corresponding to crank angle  = 0° and 180°, the piston reverses direction. Thus as 
varies from 0° to 180°, the piston velocity accelerates from 0 to a maximum and then
returns to 0. A similar behavior exists between 180° and 360°.
The connecting rod is a two-force member; hence it is evident that there are both
axial and lateral forces on the piston at crank angles other than 0° and 180°. These
lateral forces are, of course, opposed by the cylinder walls. The resulting lateral force
component normal to the cylinder wall gives rise to frictional forces between the piston
rings and cylinder. It is evident that the normal force, and thus the frictional force,
alternates from one side of the piston to the other during each cycle. Thus the piston
motion presents a challenging lubrication problem for the control and reduction of both
wear and energy loss.
The position of the piston with respect to the crank centerline is given by
x = (S/2)cos  + Lcos
[ft | m]
(6.1)
where yA  = (S/2)sin  = Lsin   can be used to eliminate   to obtain
x/L = (S/2L)cos  + [1– (S/2L)2 sin2  ]½
[dl]
(6.2)
Thus, while the axial component of the motion of the crank pin is simple harmonic, 
xA = (S/2)cos, the motion of the piston and piston pin is more complex. It may be 
226
seen from Equation (6.2), however, that as S/L becomes small, the piston motion
approaches simple harmonic. This becomes physically evident when it is recognized
that, in this limit, the connecting rod angle,  , approaches 0 and the piston motion
approaches the axial motion of the crank pin. Equations (6.1) and (6.2) may be used to
predict component velocities, accelerations, and forces in the engine. 
The volume swept by the piston as it passes from TC to BC is called the piston
displacement, disp.  Engine displacement, DISP, is then the product of the piston
displacement and the number of cylinders, DISP = (n)(disp). The piston displacement is
the product of the piston cross-sectional area and the stroke. The cylinder inside
diameter (and, approximately, also the piston diameter) is called its bore. Cylinder bore,
stroke, and number of cylinders are usually quoted in engine specifications along with
or instead of engine displacement. It will be seen later that the power output of a
reciprocating engine is proportional to its displacement. An engine of historical interest
that also used the crank-slider mechanism is discussed in the next section.
6.3 The Lenoir Cycle
An early form of the reciprocating internal combustion engine is credited to Etienne
Lenoir. His engine, introduced in 1860, used a crank-slider-piston-cylinder arrangement 
227
in which a combustible mixture confined between the piston and cylinder is ignited after
TC. The resulting combustion gas pressure forces acting on the piston deliver work by
way of the connecting rod to the rotating crank. When the piston is at BC, combustion
gases are allowed to escape. The rotational momentum of the crank system drives the
piston toward TC, expelling additional gases as it goes. A fresh combustible mixture is
again admitted to the combustion chamber (cylinder) and the cycle is repeated.
The theoretical Lenoir cycle, shown in Figure 6.3 on a pressure-volume diagram, 
consists of the intake of the working fluid (a combustible mixture) from state 0 to state
1, a constant-volume temperature and pressure rise from state 1 to state 2, approxim-
ating the combustion process, an isentropic expansion of the combustion gases to state
3, and a constant-pressure expulsion of residual gases back to state 0. Note that a
portion of the piston displacement, from state 0 to state 1, is used to take in the
combustible mixture and does not participate in the power stroke from state 2 to state
3. The engine has been called an explosion engine because the power delivered is due
only to the extremely rapid combustion pressure rise or explosion of the mixture in the
confined space of the cylinder. 
     Hundreds of  Lenoir engines were used in the nineteenth century, but the engine is
quite inefficient by todays standards. In 1862, Beau de Rochas pointed out that the 
228
efficiency of internal combustion could be markedly improved in reciprocating engines
by compression of the air-fuel mixture prior to combustion. In 1876 Niklaus Otto (who
is thought to have been unaware of Rochas’ suggestion) demonstrated an engine that 
incorporated this important feature, as described next.   
6.4 The Otto Cycle
     The Otto cycle is the theoretical cycle commonly used to represent the processes in
the spark ignition (SI) internal combustion engine.  It is assumed that a fixed mass of
working fluid is confined in the cylinder by a piston that moves from BC to TC and
back, as shown in Figure 6.4.  The cycle consists of isentropic compression of an
air-fuel mixture from state 1 to state 2, constant-volume combustion to state 3,
isentropic expansion of the combustion gases to state 4, and a constant-volume heat
rejection back to state 1. The constant-volume heat rejection is a simple expedient to
close the cycle. It obviates the need to represent the complex expansion and outflow of
229
combustion gases from the cylinder at the end of the cycle. Note that the Otto cycle is
not concerned with the induction of the air-fuel mixture or with the expulsion of
residual combustion gases. Thus only two mechanical strokes of the crank-slider are
needed in the Otto cycle, even when it is used to represent an ideal four-stroke-cycle
Otto engine.  In this case the remaining strokes are used to execute the necessary intake
and exhaust functions.  Because it involves only two strokes, the Otto cycle may also
represent a two-stroke-cycle engine.  The two-stroke-cycle engine is in principle
capable of as much work in one rotation of the crank as the four-stroke engine is in
two.  However, it is difficult to implement because of the necessity of making the
intake and exhaust functions a part of those two strokes.  It is therefore not as highly
developed or widely used as the four-stroke-cycle engine.  We will focus on the four-
stroke-cycle here.     
The simplest analysis of the Otto cycle assumes calorically perfect air as the work-
ing fluid in what is called the Air Standard cycle analysis.  Following the notation of
Figure 6.4, the compression process can be represented by the isentropic relation for a
calorically perfect gas, Equation (1.21), as
 p2/p1 = (V1/V2)k
[dl]
(6.3)
where the compression ratio, CR = V1/V2, is a fundamental parameter of all recipro-
cating engines. The diagram shows that the expansion ratio for the engine, V4 /V3, has
the same value, V1/V2. The clearance volume, V2, is the volume enclosed between the 
cylinder head and the piston at TC. Thus the compression ratio may be expressed as the
ratio of the sum of the clearance and displacement volumes to the clearance volume: 
CR = [V2 + (V1 – V2)]/V2
Thus, for a given displacement, the compression ratio may be increased by reducing the
clearance volume. 
The efficiency of the cycle can be most easily determined by considering constant-
volume-process heat transfers and the First Law cyclic integral relation, Equation (1.3).
The heat transferred in the processes 23 and 41 are
q23 = cv (T3 – T2)
[Btu/lbm | kj/kg]
(6.4)
and
 
q41 = cv (T1 – T4)
[Btu/lbm | kJ/kg]
(6.5)
Both the expansion process, 34, and the compression process, 12, are assumed to
be isentropic. Thus, by definition, they are both adiabatic.  From the cyclic integral, the
net work per unit mass is then:
w = q23 + q41 = cv (T3 – T2 + T1 – T4)
[Btu/lbm | kJ/kg]
(6.6)
230
As before, the cycle thermal efficiency is the ratio of the net work to the external heat
supplied:
Otto = w/q23 = cv (T3  – T2 + T1  – T4) / [cv (T3  – T2)]
   
  = 1 + (T1 – T4) / (T3 – T2)
  = 1 – T1/T2 = 1 – 1 / CR k-1
[dl]
(6.7)
where Equation (1.20) has been used to eliminate the temperatures. Equation (6.7)
shows that increasing compression ratio increases the cycle thermal efficiency. This is
true for real engines as well as for the idealized Otto engine. The ways in which real
spark ignition engine cycles deviate from the theoretical Otto cycle are discussed later.
EXAMPLE 6.1 
An Otto engine takes in an air-fuel mixture at 80°F and standard atmosphere presssure.
It has a compression ratio of 8. Using Air Standard cycle analysis, a heating value of
20,425 Btu/lbm, and A/F = 15, determine:
(a) The temperature and pressure at the end of compression, after combustion, and
at the end of the power stroke.
(b) The net work per pound of working fluid.
(c) The thermal efficiency.
Solution
We use the notation of Figure 6.4:
(a) p2    =  p1(V1/V2)k = 1(8)1.4 = 18.38 atm
T2  = T1(V1/V2)k – 1 = (540)(8)0.4 = 1240.6°R
T3  = T2 + qa /cv = T2 + (F/A)(HV)k/cp = 1240.6 + 1.420,425/150.24 = 9184°R
 p3 = p2T3 /T2 = 18.38(9184/1240.6) = 136.1 atm
T4 = T3 /CRk–1 = 9184/ 80.4 = 3997.2°R
p4 = p3 /CRk = 136.1/81.4 = 7.4 atm
(b) The constant-volume heat addition is governed by the fuel-air ratio and the fuel
heating value:
qa = HV(F/A) = 20,425/15 = 1361.7 Btu/lbm of air
231
qr = cv (T1 – T4) = (0.24/1.4)( 540 – 3997.4) =  – 592.7 Btu/lbm
w = qa + qr = 1361.7 + ( – 592.7) = 769 Btu/lbm
(c) The cycle termal efficiency may then be determined from the definition of the
heat engine thermal efficiency or Equation (6.7):
th = w/qa = 769/1361.7 = 0.565
th = 1 – 1/80.4 = 0.565
_____________________________________________________________________
In view of the discussion of gas properties and dissociation in Chapter 3, the values
of T3 and T4 in Example 6.1 are unrealistically high.  Much of the energy released by the
fuel would go into vibration and dissociation of the gas molecules rather than into the
translational and rotational degrees of freedom represented by the temperature.  As a
result,  significantly lower temperatures would be obtained.  Thus, while the analysis is
formally correct, the use of constant-low-temperature heat capacities in the Air
Standard cycle makes it a poor model for predicting temperature extremes when high
energy releases occur. Some improvement is achieved by using constant-high-
temperature heat capacities, but the best results would be achieved by the use of real
gas properties, as discussed in several of the references.
6.5 Combustion in a Reciprocating Engine
The constant-volume heat transfer process at TC in the Otto cycle is an artifice to
avoid the difficulties of modeling the complex processes that take place in the
combustion chamber of the SI engine. These processes, in reality, take place over a
crank angle span of 30° or more around TC. Let us consider aspects of these processes
and their implementation in more detail.
Normally, the mixture in the combustion chamber must have an air-fuel ratio in the
neighborhood of the stoichiometric value for satisfactory combustion. A more or less
homogeneous mixture may be produced outside the cylinder in a carburetor, by
injection into the intake manifold, or by throttle-body injection into a header serving
several intake manifolds.  In the case of the carburetor, fuel is drawn into the engine
from the carburetor by the low pressure created in a venturi through which the
combustion air flows. As a result, increased air flow causes lower venturi pressure and
hence increased fuel flow. The fuel system thus serves to provide an air-fuel mixture
that remains close to the stoichiometric ratio for a range of air flow rates.  Various
devices designed into the carburetor further adjust the fuel flow for the special
operating conditions encountered, such as idling and rapid acceleration.
Maximum fuel economy is usually attained with excess air to ensure that all of the
fuel is burned. A mixture with excess air is called a lean mixture. The carburetor
232
usually produces this condition in automobiles during normal constant-speed driving.
On the other hand, maximum power is achieved with excess fuel to assure that all
of the oxygen in the air in the combustion chamber is reacted. It is a matter of exploit-
ing the full power-producing capability of the displacement volume. A mixture with
excess fuel is called a rich mixture. The automotive carburetor produces a rich mixture
during acceleration by supplying extra fuel to the air entering the intake manifold.
The equivalence ratio is sometimes used to characterize the mixture ratio, whether
rich or lean. The equivalence ratio, , is defined as the ratio of the actual fuel-air ratio
to the stoichiometric fuel-air ratio. Thus   > 1 represents a rich mixture and   < 1
represents a lean mixture. In terms of air-fuel ratio,  = (A/F)stoich /(A/F).
Homogeneous air-fuel mixtures close to stoichiometric may ignite spontaneously
(that is, without a spark or other local energy source) if the mixture temperature
exceeds a temperature called the autoignition temperature. If the mixture is brought to
and held at a temperature higher than the autoignition temperature, there is a period of 
delay before spontaneous ignition or autoignition This time interval is called the
ignition delay, or ignition lag. The ignition delay depends on the characteristics of the
fuel and the equivalence ratio and usually decreases with increasing temperature. 
In spark-ignition engines, compression ratios and therefore the temperatures at the
end of compression are low enough that the air-fuel mixture is ignited by the spark plug
before spontaneous ignition can occur. SI engines are designed so that a flame front
will propagate smoothly from the spark plug into the unburned mixture until all of the
mixture has been ignitied. However, as the flame front progresses, the temperature and
pressure of the combustion gases behind it rise due to the release of the chemical
energy of the fuel. As the front propagates, it compresses and heats the unburned
mixture, sometimes termed the end-gas. Combustion is completed as planned when the
front smoothly passes completely through the end-gas without autoignition. However,
if the end-gas autoignites, a pinging or low-pitched sound called knock is heard.
The avoidance of knock due to autoignition of the end-gas is a major constraint on
the design compression ratio of an SI engine. If hot spots or thermally induced
compression of the end-gas ignite it before the flame front does, there is a more rapid
release of chemical energy from the end-gas than during normal combustion. Knock is
sometimes thought of as an explosion of the end gas that creates an abrupt pulse and
pressure waves that race back and forth across the cylinder at high speed, producing
the familiar pinging or low-pitched sound associated with knock. Knock not only
reduces engine performance but produces rapid wear and objectionable noise in the
engine. Thus it is important for a SI engine fuel to have a high autoignition
temperature. It is therefore important for SI engine fuel to have a high autoignition
temperature. Thus the knock characteristics of commercially available fuels limit the
maximum allowable design compression ratio for SI engines and hence limit their best
efficiency.     
The octane number is a measure of a gasoline's ability to avoid knock. Additives
such as tetraethyl lead have been used in the past to suppress engine knock. However,
the accumulation of lead in the environment and its penetration into the food cycle has
233
resulted in the phaseout of lead additives. Instead refineries now use appropriate blends
of  hydrocarbons as a substitute for lead additives in unleaded fuels. 
The octane number of a fuel is measured in a special variable-compression-ratio
engine called a CFR (Cooperative Fuels Research) engine. The octane rating of a fuel is
determined by comparison of its knocking characteristics with those of different 
mixtures of isooctane, C8H18, and n-heptane, C7H16. One hundred percent isooctane is
defined as having an octane number of 100 because it had the highest resistance to
knock at the time the rating system was devised. On the other hand, n-heptane is
assigned a value of 0 on the octane number scale because of its very poor knock
resistance. If a gasoline tested in the CFR engine has the same knock threshold as a
blend of 90% isooctane and 10% n-heptane, the fuel is assigned an octane rating of 90.  
In combustion chamber design, the designer attempts to balance many factors to
achieve good performance. Design considerations include locating intake valves away
from and exhaust valves near spark plugs, to keep end-gas in a relatively cool area of
the combustion chamber and thereby suppress hot-surface-induced autoignition
tendencies. Valves are, of course, designed as large as possible to reduce induction and
exhaust flow restrictions. More than one intake and one exhaust valve per cylinder are
now used in some engines to improve “engine breathing.”  In some engines, four valves
in a single cylinder are employed for this purpose.  The valves are also designed to
induce swirl and turbulence to promote mixing of fuel and air and to improve
combustion stability and burning rate.
Pollution and fuel economy considerations have in recent years profoundly
influenced overall engine and combustion chamber design. Stratified-charge engines,
for example,  attempt to provide a locally rich combustion region to control peak
temperatures and thus suppress NOx formation. The resulting combustion gases
containing unburned fuel then mix with surrounding lean mixture to complete the
combustion process, thus eliminating CO and unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust.
These processes occur at lower temperatures than in conventional combustion chamber
designs and therefore prevent significant nitrogen reactions.
6.6 Representing Reciprocating Engine Perfomance
In an earlier section, the theoretical work per unit mass of working fluid of the Otto
engine was evaluated for a single cycle of the engine, using the cyclic integral of the
First Law of Thermodynamics. The work done by pressure forces acting on a piston
can also be evaluated as the integral of pdV. It is evident therefore that the work done
during a single engine cycle is the area enclosed by the cycle process curves on the
pressure-volume diagram. Thus, instead of using the cyclic integral or evaluating pdV
for each process of the cycle, the work of a reciprocating engine can be found by
drawing the theoretical process curves on the p–V diagram and graphically integrating
them. Such a plot of pressure versus volume for any reciprocating engine, real or
theoretical, is called an indicator diagram.
234
     In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries a mechanical device known as an
engine indicator was used to produce indicator cards or diagrams to determine the
work per cycle for slow-running steam and gas reciprocating engines. The indicator
card was attached to a cylinder that rotated back and forth on its axis as the piston
oscillated, thus generating a piston position (volume) coordinate. At the same time a
pen driven by a pressure signal from the engine cylinder moved parallel to the cylinder
axis, scribing the p-V diagram over and over on the card. The work of high speed
engines is still evaluated from traces of pressure obtained with electronic sensors and
displayed on electronic monitors and through digital techniques.
The work done per cycle (from an indicator card, for instance) can be represented
as an average pressure times a volume.  Because the displacement volumes of engines
are usually known,  an engine performance parameter known as the mean effective
pressure, MEP, is defined in terms of the piston displacement. The mean effective
pressure is defined as the value of the pressure obtained by dividing the net work per
cylinder per cycle at a given operating condition by the piston displacement volume:
MEP = W/disp
[lbf/ft2 | kPa]
(6.8)
Thus the MEP is a measure of the effectiveness of a given displacement volume in
producing net work.
The power output of an engine with identical cylinders may be represented as the
product of the work per cycle and the number of cycles executed per unit time by the
engine. Thus if the engine has n cylinders, each executing N  identical thermodynamic
cycles per unit time, and delivering W work units per cylinder, with a piston
displacement, disp, the power output is given by 
P = nNW = nN MEP  disp
[ft-lbf /min | kW]
(6.9)
Expressed for the entire engine, the engine displacement is DISP = ndisp and the
engine work is MEP DISP. Hence the engine power is:
     P = N MEPDISP
[ft-lbf /min | kW]
(6.10)
where N, the number of thermodynamic cycles of a cylinder per unit time, is the number
of crank-shaft revolutions per unit time for a two-stroke-cycle engine and one-half of
the revolutions per unit time for a four-stroke-cycle engine. The factor of ½ for the
four-stroke-cycle engine arises because one thermodynamic cycle is executed each time
the crank rotates through two revolutions.
EXAMPLE 6.2
What is the displacement of an engine that develops 60 horsepower at 2500 rpm in a
four-stroke-cycle engine having an MEP of 120 psi?
235
Solution
From Equation (6.10), the displacement of the engine is
DISP = P/(N MEP) = (60)(33,000)(12)/[(2500/2)(120)] = 158.4 in3
Checking units:   (HP)(ft-lbf/HP-min)(in/ft)/[(cycles/min)(lbf/in2)] = in3
_____________________________________________________________________
If the work is evaluated from an indicator diagram the work is called indicated
work; the MEP is called the indicated mean effective pressure, IMEP; and the power is
indicated power, IP. Note that the indicated work and power, being associated with the
work done by the combustion chamber gases on the piston, do not account for
frictional or mechanical losses in the engine, such as piston-cylinder friction or the drag
of moving parts (like connecting rods) as they move through air or lubricating oil.
Brake Performance Parameters
Another way of evaluating engine performance is to attach the engine output shaft
to a device known as a dynamometer, or brake. The dynamometer measures the
torque, T, applied by the engine at a given rotational speed. The power is then
calculated from the relation
P = 2rpm T
[ft-lbf /min | N-m/min]
(6.11)
    A simple device called a prony brake, which was used in the past, demonstrates the
concept for the measurement of the shaft torque of engines. Figure 6.5 shows the prony
brake configuration in which a stationary metal band wrapped around the rotating
flywheel of the engine resists the torque transmitted to it by friction. The product of the
force measured by a spring scale, w, and the moment arm, d , gives the resisting torque.
The power dissipated is then given by 2(rpm)w d.
Modern devices such as water brakes and electrical dynamometers long ago
replaced the prony brake. The water brake is like a centrifugal water pump with no
outflow, mounted on low-friction bearings, and driven by the test engine. As with the
prony brake, the force required to resist turning of the brake (pump) housing provides
the torque data. This, together with speed measurement, yields the power output from
Equation (6.11).  The power dissipated appears as increased temperature of the water
in the brake and heat transfer from the brake. Cool water is circulated slowly through
the brake to maintain a steady operating condition. The torque measured in this way is
called the brake torque, BT, and the resulting power is called the brake power, BP. To
summarize: while indicated parameters relate to gas forces in the cylinder, brake
parameters deal with output shaft forces.
Thus the brake power differs from the indicated power in that it accounts for the
effect of all of the energy losses in the engine. The difference between the two is
referred to as the friction power, FP. Thus FP = IP – BP.
236
Friction power varies with engine speed and is difficult to measure directly. An
engine is sometimes driven without fuel by a motor-dynamometer to evaluate friction
power. An alternative to using friction power to relate brake and indicated power is
through the engine mechanical efficiency, m:
m = BP/IP
[dl]
(6.12)
Because of friction, the brake power of an engine is always less than the indicated
power; hence the engine mechanical efficiency must be less than 1. Clearly, mechanical
efficiencies as close to 1 as possible are desired.
The engine indicated power can also be expressed in terms of torque, through
Equation (6.11). Thus an indicated torque, IT, can be defined. Similarly, a brake mean
effective pressure, BMEP, may be defined that, when multiplied by the engine displace-
ment and speed, yields the brake power, analogous to Equation (6.10). Table 6.1
summarizes these and other performance parameters and relations.
The thermal efficiency, as for other engines, is a measure of the fuel economy of a
reciprocating engine. It tells the amount of power output that can be achieved for a
given rate of heat release from the fuel. The rate of energy release is, in turn, the
product of the rate of fuel flow and the fuel heating value. Thus, for a given thermal
efficiency, power output can be increased by employing a high fuel flow rate and/or
selecting a fuel with a high heat of combustion.
If the thermal efficiency is evaluated using the brake power, it is called the brake
thermal efficiency, BTE.  If the evaluation uses the indicated power, it is called the
indicated thermal efficiency, ITE.
237
It is common practice in the reciprocating engine field to report engine fuel
economy in terms of a parameter called the specific fuel consumption, SFC, analogous
to the thrust specific fuel consumption used to describe jet engine performance. The
specific fuel consumption is defined as the ratio of the fuel-mass flow rate to the power
output. Typical units are pounds per horsepower-hour or kilograms per kilowatt-hour.
Obviously, good fuel economy is indicated by low values of SFC. The SFC is called
brake specific fuel consumption, BSFC, if it is defined using brake power or indicated
specific fuel consumption, ISFC, when based on indicated power. The SFC for a
reciprocating engine is analogous to the heat rate for a steam power plant in that both
are measures of the rate of energy supplied per unit of power output, and in that low
values of both are desirable.   
Volumetric Efficiency
The theoretical energy released during the combustion process is the product of the
mass of fuel contained in the combustion chamber and its heating value if the fuel is
completely reacted. The more air that can be packed into the combustion chamber, the

system is of great importance. The volumetric efficiency,  v, is the ratio of the actual
mass of mixture in the combustion chamber to the mass of mixture that the displace-
ment volume could hold if the mixture were at ambient (free-air) density. Thus the
average mass-flow rate of air through a cylinder is v (disp) aN.  Pressure losses
across intake and exhaust valves, combustion-chamber clearance volume, the influence
of hot cylinder walls on mixture density, valve timing, and gas inertia effects all
influence the volumetric efficiency. 
EXAMPLE 6.3
A six-cylinder, four-stroke-cycle SI engine operates at 3000 rpm with an indicated
mean effective pressure of five atmospheres using octane fuel with an equivalence ratio
238
of 0.9.  The brake torque at this condition is 250 lbf–ft., and the volumetric efficiency is
85%.  Each cylinder has a five inch bore and 6 inch stroke.  Ambient conditions are
14.7 psia and 40°F.  What is the indicated horsepower, brake horsepower, and friction
horsepower; the mechanical efficiency; the fuel flow rate; and the BSFC?
Solution
The six cylinders have a total displacement of
DISP = 6×52×6/4 = 706.86 in3 
 
Then the indicated horsepower is
IP = MEP×DISP×N /[12×33,000]     [lbf /in2][in3][cycles/min]/[in/ft][ft-lbf /HP-min]
= (5)(14.7)(706.86)(3000/2)/[12×33,000] = 196.8 horsepower
The brake horsepower, from Equation (6.11), is:
BP = 2  × 3000 × 250 / 33,000 = 142.8 horsepower
Then the friction power is the difference between the indicated and brake power:
FP = 196.8 – 142.8 = 54 horsepower
and the mechanical efficiency is
m = 142.8/196.8 = 0.726
The ambient density is
a = 14.7 × 144/ [53.3 × 500] = 0.0794 lbm /ft3
and the mass flow rate of air to the engine is
ma = 0.85×0.0794×706.86×(3000/2)/1728 = 41.4 lbm /min
For octane the stoichiometric reaction equation is
C8H18 + 12.5O2 + (12.5×3.76)N2   8CO2 + 9H2O + (12.5×3.76)N2
The fuel-air ratio is then
F/A = 0.9×[(8×12) + (18×1)]/[12.5(32 + 3.76×28)] = 0.0598 lbm-fuel /lbm-air
239
The fuel flow rate is
mf = ma (F/A) = 41.4 × 0.0598 = 2.474 lbm /min
The brake specific fuel consumption is
BSFC = 60 mf /BHP = 60×2.474/142.8 = 1.04 lbm /BHP-hr

6.7 Spark-Ignition Engine Performance
A typical indicator diagram showing intake and exhaust processes, valve actuation,
and spark timing for a four-stroke-cycle SI engine is shown in Figure 6.6. It is assumed
that an appropriate air-fuel mixture is supplied from a carburetor through an intake
manifold to an intake valve, IV, and that the combustion gas is discharged through an
exhaust valve, EV, into an exhaust manifold.
The induction of the air-fuel mixture starts with the opening of the intake valve at
point A just before TC. As the piston sweeps to the right, the mixture is drawn into the
cylinder through the IV. The pressure in the cylinder is somewhat below that in the
intake manifold due to the pressure losses across the intake valve. In order to use the
momentum of the mixture inflow through the valve at the end of the intake stroke to
improve the volumetric efficiency, intake valve closure is delayed to shortly after BC at
point B. Power supplied from inertia of a flywheel (and the other rotating masses in the
engine) drives the piston to the left, compressing and raising the temperature of the
trapped mixture.
The combustion process in a properly operating SI engine is progressive in that the
reaction starts at the spark plug and progresses into the unburned mixture at a finite
speed. Thus the combustion process takes time and cannot be executed instantaneously
as implied by the theoretical cycle. In order for the process to take place as near to TC
as possible, the spark plug is fired at point S. The number of degrees of crank rotation
before TC at which the spark occurs is called the ignition advance. Advances of 10° to
30° are common, depending on speed and load. The spark advance may be controlled
by devices that sense engine speed and intake manifold pressure. Microprocessors are
now used to control spark advance and other functions, based on almost instantaneous
engine performance measurements.
Recalling the slider-crank analysis, we observ that the piston velocity at top center
is momentarily zero as the piston changes direction. Therefore no work can be done at
this point, regardless of the magnitude of the pressure force. Thus, to maximize the
work output, it is desired to have the maximum cylinder pressure occur at about 20°
after TC. Adjustment of the spark advance (in degrees before TC) allows some control
of the combustion process and the timing of peak pressure. For a fixed combustion
duration, the combustion crank-angle interval must increase with engine speed. As a
consequence, the ignition advance must increase with increasing engine speed to
240
maintain optimum timing of the peak pressure.
     Following combustion, the piston continues toward bottom center as the high
pressure gases expand and do work on the piston during the power stroke. As the
piston approaches BC, the gases do little work on the piston as its velocity again
approaches zero. As a result, not much work is lost by early opening of the exhaust
valve before BC (at point E) to start the blowdown portion of the exhaust process. It is
expedient to sacrifice a little work during the end of the power stroke in order to
reduce the work needed to overcome an otherwise-high exhaust stroke cylinder
pressure. Inertia of the gas in the cylinder and resistance to flow through the exhaust
valve opening slow the drop of gas pressure in the cylinder after the valve opens.
     Thus the gases at point E are at a pressure above the exhaust manifold pressure and,
during blowdown, rush out through the EV at high speed.  Following blowdown, gases
remaining in the cylinder are then expelled as the piston returns to TC. They remain
above exhaust manifold pressure until reaching TC because of the flow resistance of the
exhaust valve. The EV closes shortly after TC at point C, terminating the exhaust
process.  The period of overlap at TC between the intake valve opening at point A and 
exhaust valve closing at point C in Figure 6.6 allows more time for the intake and
exhaust processes at high engine speeds, when about 10 milliseconds may be available
for these processes.  At low engine speed and at idling there may be some mixture loss
through the exhaust valve and discharge into the intake manifold during this valve
overlap period. 
The combined exhaust and induction processes are seen to form a “pumping loop”
that traverses the p-V diagram in a counterclockwise direction and therefore 
241
represents work input rather than work production. The higher the exhaust stroke
pressure and the lower the intake stroke pressure, the greater the area of the pumping
loop and hence the greater the work that must be supplied by the power loop
(clockwise) to compensate. Great attention is therefore paid to valve design and other
engine characteristics that influence the exhaust and induction processes. Volumetric
efficiency is a major parameter that indicates the degree of success of these efforts.        
Performance Characteristics
A given ideal Otto-cycle engine produces a certain amount of work per cycle. For such
a cycle, MEP = W/disp is a constant. Equating the power equations (6.9) and (6.11)
shows that the average torque is proportional to MEP and independent of engine
engine speed. Therefore power output for the ideal engine is directly proportional to
the number of cycles executed per unit time, or to engine speed. Thus an Otto engine
has ideal torque and power characteristics, as shown by the solid lines in Figure 6.7.
The characteristics of real engines (represented by the dashed lines) tend to be
similar in nature to the ideal characteristics but suffer from speed-sensitive effects,
particularly at low or high speeds. Torque and power characteristics for a 3.1 liter V6
engine (ref. 9) are shown by the solid lines in Figure 6.8. Note the flatness of the
torque-speed curve and the expected peaking of the power curve at higher speed than
the torque curve. Rather than present graphical characteristics such as this in their 
242
brochures, automobile manufacturers usually present only values for the maximum
power and torque and the speeds at which they occur.  Engine characteristics such as
those shown in the figure are invaluable to application engineers seeking a suitable
engine for use in a product.
6.8 The Compression-Ignition or Diesel Cycle
The ideal Diesel cycle differs from the Otto cycle in that combustion is at constant
pressure rather than constant volume. The ideal cycle, shown in Figure 6.9, is
commonly implemented in a reciprocating engine in which air is compressed without
fuel from state 1 to state 2.  With a typically high compression ratio, state 2 is at a
temperature high enough that fuel will ignite spontaneously when sprayed directly into
the air in the combustion chamber from a high-pressure fuel injection system.
By controlling the fuel injection rate and thus the rate of chemical energy release in
relation to the rate of expansion of the combustion gases after state 2, a constant- 
243
pressure process or other energy release pattern may be achieved as in Figure 6.9. For
example,  if the energy release rate is high, then pressure may rise, as from 2 to 3', and
if  low may fall to 3''. Thus constant-pressure combustion made possible by controlling
the rate of fuel injection into the cyclinder implies the use of a precision fuel injection
system.
Instead of injecting fuel into the high-temperature compressed air, the cycle might
be executed by compression of an air-fuel mixture, with ignition occurring either
spontaneously or at a hot spot in the cylinder near the end of the compression process.
Inconsistency and unpredictability of the start of combustion in this approach, due to
variations in fuel and operating conditions, and to lack of control of the rate of heat
release with the possibility of severe knock, makes the operation of such an engine
unreliable, at the least, and also limits the maximum compression ratio. The Diesel
engine therefore usually employs fuel injection into compressed air rather than
carbureted mixture formation.  
In the Air Standard cycle analysis of the Diesel cycle, the heat addition process is at
constant pressure:
q23 = cp(T3 – T2)
[Btu/lbm | kJ/kg]
(6.13)
and, as with the Otto cycle, the closing process is at constant volume:
q41 = cv(T1 – T4)
[Btu/lbm | kJ/kg]
(6.14)
244
The net work and thermal efficiency are then:
w =  q23 + q41   
   =  cp(T3 – T2) + cv(T1 – T4)
   =  cvT1[k(T3/T1 – T2/T1) + 1 – T4/T1]
[Btu/lbm | kJ/kg]
(6.15)  
 
Diesel  =  w/q23 = 1 + q4-1/q23 = 1 + (cv/cp)(T1 – T4)/(T3 – T2)
   = 1 – (1/k)(T1/T2)(T4/T1 – 1)/(T3/T2 – 1)
[dl]
(6.16)
     The expressions for the net work and cycle efficiency may be expressed in terms
two parameters, the compression ratio, CR = V1/V2 (as defined earlier in treating the
Otto cycle) and the cutoff ratio, COR = V3/V2. The temperature ratios in Equations
(6.15) and (6.16) may be replaced by these parameters using, for the constant-pressure
process,
COR = V3/V2 = T3/T2
and by expanding the following identity:
T4 /T1 = (T4/T3)(T3/T2)(T2 /T1)
    = (V3 /V4)k-1(V3/V2)(V1/V2)k-1 
                = [(V3/V4)(V1/V2)]k-1COR = (COR)k-1COR
    = CORk
where the product of the volume ratios was simplified by recognizing that V4 = V1.
Thus the nondimensionalized net work and Diesel-cycle thermal efficiency are given by
w /cvT1 =  kCRk-1(COR – 1) + (1 – CORk)
[dl]
(6.17)
and
Diesel  =  1 –  (1/k)[(CORk – 1)/(COR – 1)]/CRk-1
[dl]
(6.18)
where the cutoff ratio, COR, is the ratio of the volume at the end of combustion, V3, to
that at the start of combustion, V2. Thus the cutoff ratio may be thought of as a
measure of the duration of fuel injection, with higher cutoff ratios corresponding to
longer combustion durations.
245
     Diesel-cycle net work increases with both compression ratio and cutoff ratio. This is
readily seen graphically from Figure 6.9 in terms of p-V diagram area.  As with the
Otto cycle, increasing compression ratio increases the Diesel-cycle thermal efficiency.
Increasing cutoff ratio, however, decreases thermal efficiency. This may be rationalized
by observing from the p-V diagram that much of the additional heat supplied when
injection is continued is rejected at increasingly higher temperatures. Another view is
that heat added late in the expansion process can produce work only over the remaining
part of the stroke and thus adds less to net work than to heat rejection.
EXAMPLE 6.4
A Diesel engine has a compression ratio of 20 and a peak temperature of 3000K. Using
an Air Standard cycle analysis, estimate the work per unit mass of air, the thermal
efficiency, the combustion pressure, and the cutoff ratio.
Solution
Assuming an ambient temperature and pressure of 300K and 1 atmosphere, the
temperature at the end of the compression stroke is
T2 = (300)(20)1.4 – 1 = 994.3K
and the combustion pressure is
p2 = (1)(20)1.4 = 66.3 atm
Then the cutoff ratio is
V3/V2 = T3/T2 = 3000/994.3 = 3.02
The expansion ratio is calculated as follows:
V4 /V3 = (V1/V2)/(V3 /V2) = 20/3.02 = 6.62
T4 = T3 (V3 /V4)1.4 – 1 = 3000/6.620.4 = 1409K
w = 1.005(3000 – 994.3) + (1.005/1.4)(300 – 1409) = 1219.6 kJ/kg
qa = 1.005(3000 – 994.3) = 2015.7 kJ/kg
th = w/qa = 1219.6/2015.6 = 0.605,     or 60.5%

246
6.9 Comparing Otto-Cycle and Diesel-Cycle Efficiencies
A reasonable question at this point is: Which cycle is more efficient, the Otto cycle or
the  Diesel cycle?  Figure 6.10 assists in examining this question. In general notation,
the cycle efficiency may be written as
th   =  wnet /qin = wnet /(wnet + |qout|)
 = 1 /(1 + |qout| /wnet)
[dl]
(6.19)
   
Comparing the Otto cycle 1–2–3–4 and the Diesel cycle with the same compression
ratio 1–2–3'–4, we see that both have the same heat rejection but that the Otto cycle
has the higher net work. Equation (6.19) then shows that, for the same compression
ratio, the Otto cycle has the higher efficiency.  
It has been observed that Diesel-cycle efficiency decreases with increasing cutoff
ratio for a given compression ratio. Let us examine the limit of the Diesel-cycle
efficiency for constant CR as COR approaches its minimum value, 1. We may write
Equation (6.18) as
Diesel = 1 – 1 /(kCRk-1) f (COR)
where f(COR) = (CORk – 1)/(COR – 1). Applying L'Hospital's rule, with primes
247
designating differentiation with respect to COR, to the limit of f(COR) as COR 1,
yields
 lim  f(COR) = lim (CORk – 1)'/ Lim (COR– 1)' = lim  kCORk – 1 = k
COR1
     COR1
COR1
and
 limDiesel  =  1 –  1 /CRk – 1 =  Otto
COR1
Thus the limit of the Diesel-cycle efficiency as COR approaches 1 is the Otto cycle
efficiency. Hence Equation (6.18) shows that the efficiency of the Diesel cycle must be
less than or equal to the Otto-cycle efficiency if both engines have the same
compression ratio, the same conclusion we reached by examination of the p-V diagram. 
 
Suppose, however, that the compression ratios are not the same. Compare the Otto
cycle 1–2'–3'–4 with the Diesel cycle 1–2–3'–4 having the same maximum temperature
in Figure 6.10. The Otto cycle has a smaller area, and therefore less work, than the
Diesel cycle, but the same heat rejection. Equation (6.19) demonstrates that the Otto
cycle has a lower thermal efficiency than the Diesel cycle with the same maximum
temperature.
The conclusion that must be drawn from the above comparisons is quite clear. As in
most comparative engineering studies, the result depends on the ground rules which
were adopted at the start of the study. The Otto cycle is more efficient if the
compression ratio is the same or greater than that of the competing Diesel cycle. But
knock in spark-ignition (Otto) engines limits their compression ratios to about 12,
while Diesel-engine compression ratios may exceed 20. Thus, with these higher
compression ratios, the Air Standard Diesel-cycle efficiency can exceed that of the Otto
cycle. In practice, Diesel engines tend to have higher efficiencies than SI engines
because of higher compression ratios.
6.10 Diesel-Engine Performance
In 1897, five years after Rudolph Diesel's first patents and twenty-one years after
Otto's introduction of the spark-ignition engine, Diesel's compression-ignition engine
was proven to develop 13.1 kilowatts of power with an unprecedented brake thermal
efficiency of 26.2% (ref. 7). At that time, most steam engines operated at thermal
efficiencies below 10 %; and the best gas engines did not perform much better than the
steam machines.
Diesel claimed (and was widely believed) to have developed his engine from the
principles expounded by Carnot. He had developed "the rational engine." Whether his
claims were exaggerated or not, Diesel's acclaim was well deserved. He had developed
an engine that operated at unprecedented temperatures and pressures, had proven his
concept of ignition of fuel by injection into the compressed high-temperature air, and
had overcome the formidable problems of injecting a variety of fuels in appropriate
248
amounts with the precise timing required for satisfactory combustion. His is a 
fascinating story of a brilliant and dedicated engineer (refs. 7, 8).
In the Diesel engine, the high air temperatures and pressures prior to combustion
are attributable to the compression of air alone rather than an air-fuel mixture.
Compression of air alone eliminates the possibility of autiognition during compression
and makes high compression ratios possible. However, because of the high pressures
and temperatures, Diesel engines must be designed to be structurally more rugged.
Therefore, they tend to be heavier than SI engines with the same brake power.
The energy release process in the Diesel engine is controlled by the rate of injection
of fuel. After a brief ignition lag, the first fuel injected into the combustion chamber
autoignites and the resulting high gas temperature sustains the combustion of the
remainder of the fuel stream as it enters the combustion chamber. Thus it is evident that
the favorable fuel characteristic of high autoignition temperature for an SI engine is an
unfavorable characteristic for a Diesel engine.
In the Diesel engine, a low autoignition temperature and a short ignition delay are
desirable. Knock is possible in the Diesel engine, but it is due to an entirely different
cause than knock in a spark-ignition engine. If fuel is ignited and burns as rapidly as it
is injected, then smooth, knock-free combustion occurs. If, on the other hand, fuel
accumulates in the cylinder before ignition due to a long ignition lag, an explosion or
detonation occurs, producing a loud Diesel knock. The cetane number is the parameter
that identifies the ignition lag characteristic of a fuel.
The cetane number, like the octane number, is determined by testing in a CFR
engine. The ignition lag of the test fuel is compared with that of a mixture of n-cetane,
C16H34, and heptamethylnonane, HMN (ref. 10). Cetane, which has good ignition
qualities, is assigned a value of 100; and HMN, which has poor knock behavior, a value
of 15. The cetane number is then given by the sum of the percentage of n-cetane and
0.15 times the percentage of HMN in the knock-comparison mixture. A cetane number
of 40 is the minimum allowed for a Diesel fuel. 
6.11 Superchargers and Turbochargers
The importance of the volumetric efficiency, representing the efficiency of induction
of the air-fuel mixture into the reciprocating-engine cylinders, was discussed earlier.
Clearly, the more mixture mass in the displacement volume, the more chemical energy
can be released and the more power will be delivered from that volume.
During the Second World War, the mechanical supercharger was sometimes used
with SI aircraft engines to increase the power and operational ceiling of American
airplanes. Today supercharging is used with both Diesel engines and SI engines. The
supercharger is a compressor that supplies air to the cylinder at high pressure so that
the gas density in the cylinder at the start of compression is well above the free-air
density. The piston exhaust gases are allowed to expand freely to the atmosphere
through the exhaust manifold and tailpipe. The supercharger is usually driven by a belt
or gear train from the engine crank shaft.
249
Figure 6.11 shows a modification of the theoretical Otto cycle to accommodate
mechanical supercharging. The supercharger supplies air to the engine cyclinders at
pressure p7 in the intake process 7  1. The processes 4  5  6 purge most of the
combustion gas from the cylinder. The most striking change in the cycle is that the
induction-exhaust loop is now traversed counterclockwise, indicating that the cylinder
is delivering net work during these processes as well as during the compression-
expansion loop. It should be remembered, however, that part of the cycle indicated
power must be used to drive the external supercharger.
The turbosupercharger or turbocharger, for short, is a supercharger driven by a
turbine using the exhaust gas of the reciprocating engine, as shown schematically in
Figure 6.12. A cutaway view of a turbocharger is shown in Figure 6.13(a). Figure
6.13(b) presents a diagram for the turbocharger. Compact turbochargers commonly
increase the brake power of an engine by 30% or more, as shown in Figure 6.8, where
the performance of an engine with and without turbocharging is compared. There, a
substantial increase in peak torque and flattening of the torque-speed curve due to
turbocharging is evident.
For a supercharged engine, the brake power, BP, is the indicated power (as in
Figure 6.11) less the engine friction power and the supercharger shaft power:
BP = DISP  IMEP  N  –  Pm  –  FP
[ft-lbf /min | kJ/s]
(6.15)
250
where Pm is the supercharger-shaft mechanical power supplied by the engine (0 for a
turbocharger). The IMEP includes the positive work contribution of the exhaust loop.
The exhaust back pressure of the reciprocating engine is higher with a turbocharger
than for a naturally aspirated or mechanically supercharged engine because of the drop
in exhaust gas pressure through the turbine. The engine brake power increases
primarily because of a higher IMEP due to the added mass of fuel and air in the
cylinder during combustion. Intercooling between the compressor and the intake
manifold may be used to further increase the cylinder charge density. Turbocharging
may increase engine efficiency, but its primary benefit is a substantial increase in brake
power.
In a turbocharged engine, a wastegate may be required to bypass engine exhaust
gas around the turbine at high engine speeds. This becomes necessary when the
compressor raises the intake manifold pressure to excessively high levels, causing
engine knock or threatening component damage. Thirty to forty percent of the exhaust
flow may be bypassed around the turbine at maximum speed and load (ref. 1).
251
252
6.12 The Automobile Engine and Air Pollution
Since the Second World War, concern for environmental pollution has grown from
acceptance of the status quo to recognition and militance of national and international
scope.  Among other sources, causes of the well-known Los Angeles smog problem
were identified as hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in exhaust
emissions from motor vehicle reciprocating engines.  As a result, national and
California automobile air pollution limits for automobiles have been established and
toughened. Prior to the Clean Air Act of 1990, the U.S. federal exhaust-gas emissions
standards limited unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen to
0.41, 3.4, and 1.0 g/mile, respectively.  According to reference 12, today it takes 25
autos to emit as much CO and unburned hydrocarbons and 4 to emit as much NOx as a
single car in 1960.  The reference anticipated that, led by existing California law and
other factors, future engine designs should be targeted toward satisfying a tailpipe
standard of 0.25, 3.4, 0.4 g/mile.  Indeed, the 1990 Clean Air Act (refs. 15,16)
specified these limits for the first 50,000 miles or five years of operation for all
passenger cars manufactured after 1995.  In addition to the regulations on gaseous
emissions, the Clean Air Act of 1990 adopted the California standard for particulate
matter of 0.08 g/mile for passenger cars.  The standards on particulates are particularly
difficult for the Diesel engine, because of its of soot-producing tendency.
The automobile air pollution problem arises in part because the reactions in the
exhaust system are not in chemical equilibrium as the gas temperature drops. Oxides of
nitrogen, once formed in the cylinder at high temperature, do not return to equilibrium
concentrations of nitrogen and oxygen in the cooling exhaust products.  Likewise, CO
formed with rich mixtures or by dissociation of CO2 in the cylinder at high temperature
does not respond rapidly to an infusion of air as its temperature drops in the exhaust
system.  Their concentrations may be thought of as constant or frozen.  Unburned
hydrocarbons are produced not only by rich combustion but also by unburned mixture
lurking in crevices (such as between piston and cylinder above the top piston ring), by
lubricating oil on cylinder walls and the cylinder head that absorbs and desorbs 
hydrocarbons before and after combustion, and by transient operating conditions.
Starting in 1963, positive crankcase ventilation was used in all new cars to duct
fuel-rich crankcase gas previously vented to the atmosphere back into the engine intake
system.  Later in the ‘60s, various fixes were adopted to comply with regulation of
tailpipe unburned hydrocarbons and CO, including lowering compression ratios.
In 1973, NOx became federally regulated, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was
employed to reduce NOx formation through reduced combustion temperatures.  At the
same time, HC and CO standards were reduced further, leading to the use of the
oxidizing catalytic converter.  Introduction of air pumped into the tailpipe provided
additional oxygen to assist in completion of the oxidation reactions.  In 1981, a
reducing catalytic converter came into use to reduce NOx further.  This device does not
perform well in an oxidizing atmosphere.  As a result, two-stage catalytic converters
were applied, with the first stage reducing NOx in a near-stoichiometric mixture and the
253
second oxidizing the combustibles remaining in the exhaust with the help of air
introduced between the stages.  This fresh air does not the increase NOx significantly,
because of the relatively low temperature of the exhaust.  The three-way catalytic
converter using several exotic metal catalysts to reduce all three of the gaseous
pollutants was also introduced.
The use of catalytic converters to deal with all three pollutants brought about
significant simultaneous reductions in the three major gaseous pollutants from
automobiles.  This allowed fuel-economy-reducing modifications that had been
introduced earlier to satisfy emission reduction demands to be eliminated or relaxed,
leading to further improvements in fuel economy.
Catalytic converters, however, require precise control of exhaust gas oxygen to
near-stoichiometric mixtures.  The on-board computer has made possible control of
mixture ratio and spark timing in response to censor outputs of intake manifold
pressure, exhaust gas oxygen, engine speed, air flow, and incipient knock.  The oxygen,
or lambda, censor located in the exhaust pipe upstream of the three-way converter
or between the two-stage converters is very sensitive to transition from rich to lean
exhaust and allows close computer control of the mixture ratio to ensure proper
operation of the catalytic converter.  Computer control of carburetors or fuel injection
as well as other engine functions has allowed simultaneous improvement in fuel
economy and emissions in recent years.  Thus, while emissions have been drastically
reduced since 1974, according to reference 11 the EPA composite fuel economy of the
average U.S. passenger car has nearly doubled; although this improvement has not
come from the engine alone.  Despite the hard-won gains in emissions control and fuel
economy, further progress may be expected.
EXAMPLE 6.5
The 1990 NOx emissions standard is 0.4 grams per mile.  For an automobile burning
stoichiometric octane with a fuel mileage of 30 mpg, what is the maximum tailpipe
concentration of NOx in parts per million?  Assume that NOx is represented by NO2 and
that the fuel density is 692 kilograms per cubic meter.
Solution
For the stoichiometric combustion of octane, C8H18, the air-fuel ratio is 15.05 and
the molecular weight of combustion products is 28.6.  The consumption of octane is
mf = (692)(1000)(3.79×10-3)/ 30 = 87.4 g/mile
[Note: (kg/m3)(g/kg)(m3/gal)/(mile/gal) = g/mile.] The concentration of NOx is the ratio
of the number of moles of NOx to moles of combustion gas products:
mole Nox /mole cg = (mNOx /mf)(mf / mcg)(Mcg /MNOx)
         = (0.4/87.4)(28.6/46)/ (15.05 + 1) = 0.0001773
254
or 177.3 parts per million  (ppm).
