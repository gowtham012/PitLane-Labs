16.1 Definition of Cranktrain Function and Terminology 
 
The Cranktrain is the heart of the reciprocating piston engine, and the purpose is 
to translate the linear motion of the pistons into rotary motion for the purpose of 
extracting useful work. This is typically composed of a connecting rod, crankshaft, and 
flywheel or power takeoff device. The actual realization of these parts take on many 
forms, and the description and physics of these were covered in Chapter 6.  
The crankshaft is usually composed of one or multiple throws, to which the 
connecting rod is attached with either fluid film journal bearings or rolling element 
bearings as shown in Figure 16.1. The crankshaft is typically cast or forged of iron or 
steel. In addition to its main function of translating linear to rotary motion, the crankshaft 
typically drives many of the engine accessories such as: valvetrain, lube system, cooling 
system, or charging system. Crankshaft rotation direction can be either clockwise or 
counterclockwise, depending on driveline packaging and requirements. It can rotate in 
both directions in some applications, if the valvetrain mechanism is designed 
appropriately. One example would be golf carts, where the two stroke engine drives the 
vehicle forward, and can be stopped and restarted in the opposite direction to provide a 
means of reverse. The crankshaft typically incorporates additional balance weights to 
smooth the vibration produced by the oscillating of the piston.

The connecting rod in its simplest form is a beam with two pin joints at either 
end, as shown in Figure 16.2. One end sees relatively low rotation speeds as it is 
connected to the piston, while the other sees high rotation speeds as it is attached to the 
crankshaft. The connecting rod will typically support the bearings or bushings for both 
ends of its application. It is one of the most stressed components in the engine and 
subjected to high tensile, compressive, and bending stress. It can be cast, forged, or 
sintered from powdered metal.

The flywheel provides a variety of functions. As the name implies, it adds 
additional rotating inertia to the crankshaft, to smooth out the cyclical speed variation 
produced by the reciprocating piston schedule. This is most important at idle for 
minimizing torsion vibration to the engine, and for ease of fuel calibration. When 
attempting to move a vehicle from stationary, the flywheel provides energy to overcome 
the inertia of the vehicle for smooth starts. If the inertia of the cranktrain is too low, the 
engine may stall or unnecessarily high RPM will be required to launch the vehicle from 
rest. A further function of the flywheel is often the power takeoff, as it provides a friction 
surface for the clutch to act against, or the torque converter to mount to, as shown in 
Figure 16.3.  
 
 
Figure 16.3: Flywheel mounted to crankshaft 
 
As the cranktrain geometry is part of the initial engine layout, and composes a 
significant portion of the engine cost, it is important to plan ahead for future product 
improvements. Often this includes increases in engine bore or stroke to increase 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods

B. Dondlinger 
displacement, addition of supercharging, and/or an increase in engine speed. The 
additional cost of package protecting for product improvements must be balanced against 
the potential increases in cost or weight of a given component, and against the cost of an 
engine redesign at a later date. One possible strategy could be to release the initial engine 
design with cast components, and later upgrade to forged ones.  
 
  
16.2 Operating Environment Considerations 
 
 
Typical ambient temperatures are from -30ºC to 50ºC. It is important when sizing 
bearing fits, or considering material properties, to plan for the temperatures that the 
engine will see at startup. It may also be important to consider bearing fits at 
temperatures well below operating temperatures, to prevent component yielding while in 
storage.  
 
Operating temperatures of the crankshaft and connecting rod are typically oil 
operating temperature of between 80-110ºC, but peak oil temperatures can rise to 150ºC. 
Connecting rod crankpin bore temps are similar, but piston pin end temperatures are 
higher as they are exposed to the bottom side of the piston. The connecting rod piston pin 
end typically sees 150-180ºC. Flywheel temperatures will depend on location in the 
engine, and exposure to cooling airflow. They can vary from: the same temperature as the 
crankshaft, lower with cooling air flow, to higher with frequent clutch engagement. 
 
The crankshaft and connecting rods are typically immersed in an oil bath in the 
cylinder block. As a by product of combustion, water and sulfuric acid are present and 
often work past the piston rings into the oil bath.  
 
In addition to the safety factor calculations made with respect to fatigue life of 
material, duty cycle must be considered. Some engines such as over-the-highway truck, 
locomotive, ship, generators, lawn equipment, and racing engines may operate close to 
maximum load for most of their operating lives. While passenger car engines may spend 
less than 0.1% of their useful life at maximum load. The cranktrain is typically one of the 
more expensive assemblies in an engine, and when it breaks it frequently damages other 
components in the engine (cylinder block, cylinder heads, piston, valvetrain). Therefore 
high reliability is needed from the crankshaft design.  
 
 
16.3 Description of Common Cranktrain Configurations 
and Architectures 
 
16.3.1 Crankshaft Configurations 
 
 
Crankshafts typically fall into single or multiple throw configurations, with single 
or shared journals for connecting rods. A single throw crankshaft is typically used in 
single or twin cylinder applications, with either a single rod per journal or two. A 
multiple throw crankshaft can be used for a two cylinder engine, but is typically used for 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods 
9/2/2015 
16-5 
B. Dondlinger 
three or more cylinders. Inline engine configurations use a single rod per throw, while 
vee engines usually have two rods per throw.  
 
Multi-throw crankshafts are typically arranged in a single plane or multiple 
planes. A single-plane or flat-plane crankshaft is where all crankpin throws are at either 
0º or 180º, as on in inline four cylinder engine as shown in Figure 16.4. A multi-plane 
arrangement is where the crankpin throws are arranged in different planes. A two-plane 
crankshaft (cross, cruciform) is where the throws are indexed 90º apart as on the V-8 
engine shown in Figure 16.5, or three-plane like on a six cylinder engine.  
 
  
 
Figure 16.4: Single-plane crankshaft 
 
 
 
Figure 16.5: Dual-plane crankshaft 
 
In addition to the forces and loads, there are various other design considerations: 
 One piece or assembled crankshaft 
 Bearing type (rolling element or journal bearing) 
 Integral or separately attached counterweights (racing) 
 Type of power take-off 
 Accessory drive location and type 
 Cost versus weight 
 Duty cycle 
 Volume and manufacturing methods 
 
 
16.3.1.1 Assembled or Built-up Crankshafts

manufactured separately, then joined together to form a single crankshaft by means of a

press fit, bolted, or welded joint. A single cylinder, 2-stroke crankshaft is shown in 
Figures 16.6. 
 
 
Figure 16.6: Assembled crankshaft 
 
 
An assembled crankshaft is typically used on either very small or very large 
engines to ease the manufacture. The manufacture of small crankshafts, typically single 
throw, can be made less expensive since the creation of multiple circular pieces are made 
on a simple lathe and are then centerless ground. This does not require a more expensive 
offset crankshaft grinding machine. Additionally, this makes manufacture of very large 
crankshafts for ships and stationary pumping engines easier, as they can be made of more 
easily managed ‗small‘ pieces.  
 
Another key advantage of the assembled crankshaft is the ability to employ 
rolling element bearings, which reduce engine friction and ease lubrication requirements. 
The elements of the crankshaft can be assembled around a rolling element bearing and 
connecting rod assembly. This is common in 2-stroke engines, where splash lube or 
vapor lube are used to enable rolling element bearings and eliminate the need for pressure 
lubrication. The assembled crankshaft also allows the cylinder block to be vertical or 
horizontal split into two halves. 
 
One of the key challenges for the assembled crankshaft is aligning all of the sub-
components during assembly to a high tolerance. This usually requires the application of 
large force to assemble and then straighten the components to achieve the desired 
straightness of the crankshaft for the alignment of bearings. The key failure mode of an 
assemble crankshaft is the misalignment of these components during operation. The 
torque of the engine may cause the assembled joints to slip with respect to one another, 
and ―scissor‖, leading to misalignment of the crankshaft.   
 
 
16.3.1.2 One Piece Crankshaft 
 
 
A one piece crankshaft is typically cast or forged as a single unit, then machined 
and ground to achieve the final geometry as shown in Figure 16.7. This method of 
manufacture is advantageous for larger volume production which justifies the investment 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods

B. Dondlinger 
in casting or forging tooling, and dedicated offset crankshaft grinding equipment. One 
piece crankshafts are not typically straightened, which is an advantage over an assembled 
crankshaft in a multiple cylinder engine. Some V-8 crankshafts are cast as flat plane, and 
then twisted to cross plane while still hot.  
 
The disadvantage of this type of crankshaft is that only plain bearings can be 
used, and pressure fed lubrication and cross drillings are required. This typically forces 
the cylinder block to be split along the bearing centerline, and affects overall engine 
architecture.  
 
 
Figure 16.7: One piece crankshaft 
 
 
16.3.2 Connecting Rod Configurations 
There are four basic configurations for the crankpin bore of the connecting rod as 
shown in Figures 16.8-16.11. These vary in geometry according to function. 
1. Plain (most common), 
2. Angled split (for serviceability), 
3. One piece (for rolling element bearings), and 
4. Articulated (for radial engines).

Figure 16.9: Angled split connecting rod 
 
 
Figure 16.10: One piece connecting rod 
 
 
Figure 16.11: Articulated connecting rod 
 
The plain connecting rod is most common in current automotive practice. It allows 
addition of bearings of a different material type than the connecting rod. An angle split 
connecting rod allows it to be removed through the top of the engine, which helps rebuild 
of engines while the cylinder block is still in the vehicle. This is common in over the 
highway trucks and locomotives, which have a large crankpin and consequently large 
bearing. A disadvantage of an angled split rod is non symmetrical loading of the 
connecting rod crankpin bore. The rod cap is now at an angle to the loading, and it makes 
the cap slide with respect to the upper rod, thus requiring additional attention to cap 
locating. 
 A one piece connecting rod enables a rolling element bearing to be used to reduce 
engine friction. However, the application of a one piece connecting rod is usually limited 
to engines with an assembled crankshaft, to provide access to assemble the bearing and 
crankpin through the middle of the connecting rod. A one piece connecting rod is lighter 
and less expensive than a plain rod since rod cap fasteners are not required, however a 
bearing quality surface is required on the crankpin end, since the rollers ride directly on 
the rod.

An articulated rod is used for radial engines where more than one connecting rod 
must attach to the same crank journal. This arrangement reduces the axial length of the 
crankpin journal for multiple cylinders, and is most common in air-cooled radial aircraft 
engines. All connecting rods attach to the same crankpin to allow all cylinders to face the 
cooling airflow equally. 
Regardless of crankpin bore arrangement, the job of the connecting rod is to keep the 
crankpin bearing as round as possible to ensure an even oil film and prevent contact of 
the rod bearing to the crankshaft. The connecting rod cap may have reinforcing ribs to 
increase stiffness, as shown in Figure 16.12. A single rib is easiest to cast or forge, but a 
double rib is a more efficient distribution of stiffness. 
 
 
Figure 16.12: Rib on connecting rod cap 
 
There are two general configurations of connecting rod beam cross-section as shown 
in Figure 16.13-16.14. The beam is the portion of the connecting rod that connects the 
piston pin and crankpin ends, and when viewed in cross section resembles a capital letter 
―I‖ or capital letter ―H‖.

Figure 16.14: H-beam  
 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods

16-10 
B. Dondlinger 
The I-Beam connecting rod is most common in use because it puts the most 
material in the areas of maximum bending stress while reducing material where it is not 
needed. The I-Beam shape also lends itself well to the casting, forging, or Powdered 
Metal (PM) processes. The pull direction for the beam is in the same direction of the pin 
bosses, making forming easier and reducing the requirement for material removal.  
The H-Beam connecting rod is more difficult to manufacture, but this geometry 
offers a more stable, lighter design. The H-beam rod allows a more gradual transition of 
stiffness between the main beam and the crankpin end of the connecting rod, reducing 
stress in this critical radius. It also has greater bending stiffness in the crankpin axial 
direction than an I-bean rod. This may lead to increased edge loading on the crankpin 
bearing, when two rods share the same journal. Due to the added expense of manufacture, 
this is usually only seen in competition engines.  
 
A hollow beam connecting rod could result in the lowest possible connecting rod 
weight for a given stiffness. While the hollow beam does not offer any benefit in tension, 
it better resists column buckling in compression and bending stress caused by rod whip. 
However, manufacturing of this rod is difficult and limits its application in practice. This 
geometry could be generated from a weldment of several pieces, or a core could be used 
in a cast rod.  
 
The small boss that interfaces with the piston pin typically utilizes a pressed 
bushing. If a bushing is not used, a coating is required on one of the two mating 
components to reduce wear. This end of the rod sees relatively low rotation speed, and 
reverses direction between TDC and BDC, resulting in solid friction or mixed lubrication. 
Geometry of the piston pin end varies between straight sides and tapered, depending on 
anticipated engine operating speed and inertial loads, as shown in Figure 16.15. 
Occasionally an oil feed hole is added for the connecting rod piston pin bushing to 
improve lubrication; either as a passive splash oiling hole or pressure lube up from the 
crankpin bearing.

16.3.3 Flywheel Configurations 
The most common arrangement of flywheel in automotive is a separate disc 
attached to the end of the crankshaft, usually by a bolted joint. The total cranktrain inertia 
is composed of flywheel, crankshaft, rotating mass of connecting rods, crank pulley for 
driving accessories, and clutch or torque converter. Occasionally the flywheel is 
incorporated as part of the crankshaft counterweights, the disc varying in thickness to 
achieve the desired balance counterweight. This is common practice in motorcycle 
applications as shown in Figure 16.16, and 2-stroke engines. The flywheel may also 
serve additional functions such as a power take off (clutch or torque converter interface), 
as a drive mechanism for the starter, or as a tone wheel for electronic engine controls.

16.4 Detailed Design of Crankshaft Geometry 
 
During the concurrent engine design process, the design of the cranktrain is not a 
linear process from point A to point B. As the design of the overall engine evolves, so 
must the cranktrain design. However, there is a general flow to the steps taken to 
calculate loads and design a crankshaft for a single throw crankpin as shown in Figure 
16.17. While actual stress can be calculated by classical methods, most will use Finite 
Element Analysis once loads are known.

16.4.1 Detailed Design of Crankshaft Geometry 
 
The geometry of a crankshaft is complicated, and the loading varies as a function 
of its rotational position. Because of the dissimilar cross-sections of the crankshaft, it will 
be sensitive to discontinuities in stiffness. It is at these stiffness discontinuities that stress 
will be concentrated. Generally, the crankshaft fillet will be the most highly stressed area 
and will require the most detailed design attention as the materials used to make 
crankshafts are typically sensitive to notch factors. Loading at the fillet alternates as 
shown in Figure 16.18-16.19; TDC-Firing puts the crankpin in compression, and TDC-
Overlap puts the crankpin in tension. Stress in this area is further magnified by torsional 
vibration, to be discussed later. Often metal improvement processes, such as shot peening

or fillet rolling, are used to introduce residual compressive stress at the fillet radii to 
improve fatigue life.

Pin overlap, crank web thickness, and journal fillet radius are the key parameters 
that are varied in crankshaft design. As illustrated in Figure 16.20, a crankshaft that gets 
it‘s stiffness from pin overlap (large journal diameters and short stroke) does not need 
much crank web thickness, if at all. While a crankshaft that has little or no pin overlap 
will required a thicker crank web to gain stiffness. Depending on the geometry of the 
crank, it will be more sensitive to web thickness or pin overlap, as displayed in Figure 
16.21. Cross drillings or hollow sections in the crankpin and main journals can reduce the 
pin stiffness and minimize the stiffness discontinuity that leads to a stress concentration.

One way to increase pin overlap, is to increase journal bearing diameter for a 
given engine stroke, as shown in Equation 16.1. This will help crank stiffness, but 
increasing pin diameter increases fluid film friction at the bearings and reduces net 
engine power, and increases fuel consumption. It also increases crankshaft weight as the

Fillet radii have enormous effects on the maximum stress in the crankshaft.  Once 
the basic proportions of the crank have been determined, the choice of these radii is 
critical. The larger the fillet that can be used on the crankpin or main journal, the less the 
stress concentration notch factor will be. However, the larger the journal fillet, the less 
surface area is available for the connecting rod or main bearing as shown in Figure 
16.22.  
Several things can be done to minimize the stress at these fillet radii, but at 
additional cost. The geometry can be improved by using an undercut fillet as also shown 
in Figure 16.23 to increase the effective radius. The material properties can be improved 
by introducing residual compressive stresses by fillet rolling or shot peening the fillet 
radius.

16.4.2 Crankshaft Initial Sizing Values 
 
When designing a new crankshaft, it is useful to have a starting point. This can 
come from benchmarking of successful crankshafts in similar applications, or from initial 
sizing values. These initial sizing values for the crankshaft were developed in the 1930‘s 
and 1940‘s in an era before computer aided design, and were developed by loading 
crankshafts and measuring displacement with extensometers or strain gauges. In modern 
practice, initial values will be assumed and the design will progress to FEA. 
Initial sizing guidelines are listed in Table 16.1 and illustrated in Figure 16.24 
below. These values are given as a function of cylinder bore diameter. When designing a 
crankshaft, it is important to make sure that the stroke and crankpin length don‘t interfere 
with the cylinder bore in the cylinder block, which might require raising the deck height 
of the cylinder block.

The majority of external loads are applied to the crankshaft perpendicular to its 
rotational centerline, and the reaction forces are thus transmitted through the rod and 
main bearings.  However, in addition to these loads the crankshaft is exposed to some 
thrust loading – loading applied along the axis of crankshaft rotation.  Thrust loads occur 
as the clutch in a manual transmission application is engaged or disengaged.  With an 
automatic transmission, the load transfer through the torque converter includes a thrust 
component.  If the camshaft is driven with a gear train using helical gears a further thrust 
load is transmitted to the crankshaft. As the engine fires, the crankshaft throw deflects, 
and the main bearings spread axially. Finally, dimensional stack-up between the 
crankshaft and the connecting rods and cylinder bore centerlines results in a small thrust 
load.  For all of these reasons the crankshaft must include a thrust bearing surface.  This 
is typically provided in conjunction with one of the main bearings.  Because the largest 
thrust loads are generated at the rear of the crankshaft the thrust bearing is often placed at 
or near the rear main bearing; for packaging reasons the second-to-rear main bearing is 
often used since the rear main bearing must also incorporate the rear oil seal.  If the 
crankshaft stiffness is sufficient the middle main bearing may be chosen.  This is done 
because the machined thrust surface provides the fore and aft datum for crankshaft 
machining.  Placing this datum in the middle of the crankshaft allows the fore and aft 
tolerances to be split equally between the front and rear portions of the crankshaft, 
making machining process control easier.

16.4.3 Crankshaft Natural Frequencies  
 
Torsional vibration results whenever an unsteady or cyclical load is applied to a 
spinning shaft.  A number of components in engines, including camshafts, water and oil 
pump drives, various accessory drives, and the crankshaft meet the criteria for potential 
torsional vibration problems.  Of these the crankshaft receives by far the most attention 
since the combination of the length of the shaft and the magnitude of the forces result in 
the most severe conditions.  Torsional vibration increases the stresses in the crankshaft 
webs, and the resulting oscillation of the crankshaft nose loads and unloads the camshaft 
and accessory drives.  The latter significantly increases drive wear and engine noise.  In 
heavy-duty engines camshaft torsional vibration is receiving increasing attention, and 
examples of vibration problems in accessory drives can be readily found.  The focus in 
this section will be on the crankshaft, but many of the principles discussed here can be 
applied to other components. 
In Figure 16.25 the fundamental concepts of torsional vibration are summarized, 
as well as in Equation 16.2.  Looking at this simple case a disk of some appreciable mass 
is rigidly mounted at the end of a shaft, the other end of which is mounted to prevent it 
from spinning.  A torque is then applied to the disk to rotate it slightly from its initial 
position, elastically deforming (twisting) the shaft.  The torque is then suddenly released, 
and the shaft unwinds.  The shaft seeks to return to its original non-deformed state, but 
the mass of the disk results in an overshoot and the shaft is twisted in the opposite 
direction.  The disk will oscillate back and forth at the natural frequency of the system, 
with decaying amplitude in each successive oscillation.  The natural frequency is 
determined by the mass of the disk and the stiffness of the shaft.

If the shaft consists of several sections of different diameters, as in a stepped shaft 
or crankshaft, the equivalent torsional spring constant can be calculated in same way as

The case just described can now be extended in two important ways.  First, one 
can imagine that the shaft and disk are spinning at some constant speed and that the 
torque is applied to and released from the spinning disk.  In this case the resulting 
oscillation of the disk will be superimposed on the mean speed of the shaft and disk.  The 
next extension is to consider a case where the spinning shaft has not one but several 
disks, and at various points in time sudden torque impulses are applied in succession to 
various of the disks.  The problem has now become appreciably more complex as 
different portions of the shaft twist and untwist relative to other portions.  Where the first 
two cases each had one degree of freedom and a single natural frequency this third case 
has an additional degree of freedom and natural frequency for each additional disk.  
Assuming the mass of each disk, and the shaft stiffness between each disk, are known, 
and assuming that the torque impulses applied to each disk can be characterized as a 
function of time the torsional vibration can still be calculated.  The resulting matrix of 
equations is difficult to solve by hand, but can readily be addressed with computer 
calculations. 
The third case just described is exactly that of the crankshaft in a multi-cylinder 
engine.  In order to address crankshaft torsional vibration it is necessary to characterize 
both the crankshaft system and the system excitation – in this case the torque applied to 
the system at each cylinder.   
Turning first to the crankshaft system it is helpful to characterize this system as a 
series of disks connected by stiff springs as shown in Figure 16.26.  Each disk represents 
the rotating mass associated with a portion of the crankshaft system.  The first disk 
represents the crankshaft nose, vibration dampener, and accessory drive pulleys.  Disks 
two through seven represent the cylinders of this in-line six-cylinder engine.  The eighth 
disk represents the flywheel or torque converter.  It should be noted that the transmission 
and the remainder of the drivetrain are not represented.  This is an accurate approach in 
automotive engines because transmission of torsional vibration is minimized through the 
fluid coupling in the torque converter and the clutch pack typically has a torsional 
compensator built in.  If the engine were rigidly mounted to the component being driven

(an electric generator, for example) this additional mass would need to be included.  The 
example eight mass system shown here has eight degrees of freedom and eight natural 
frequencies.  The first three vibration modes are depicted in Figure 16.27.  For each 
vibration mode the crankshaft will have that number of nodes – locations along the 
crankshaft at which angular deflection relative to the mean crankshaft speed is zero.  
Because crankshafts are relatively stiff only the first mode or two are generally of 
interest.  As crankshaft stiffness increases the natural frequency of each mode increases; 
the natural frequencies of the higher modes of a crankshaft system are typically above the 
frequencies at which significant forces will be seen.  It should be noted that for each 
vibration mode the anti-node, or location of maximum angular displacement, is at the 
crankshaft nose.  This results directly from the flywheel location at the opposite end of 
the crankshaft.

It is now important to look at the exciting forces – the net torque impulse applied 
at each crankshaft throw, or at each of the disks two through seven in the model shown in

Figure 16.26.  The net torque impulse, as a function of crank angle is the net result of the 
pressure and reciprocating forces, as depicted in Figure 16.28.  Because this combination 
of forces cannot be directly represented mathematically it is helpful to represent it as a 
Fourier Series.  The torque signal is expressed as the sum of a constant value and an 
infinite series of harmonics at various amplitudes and frequencies.  Because the torque 
impulse is repeated every second revolution in a four-stroke engine the fundamental 
frequency is a half-order frequency, repeating every second revolution.  The remaining 
harmonics then represent each half order in an infinite series.  The Campbell Diagram 
shown in Figure 16.29 shows the frequency of each harmonic, from the half-order 
through the sixth order, as a function of engine speed.

Torsional vibration requires the application of the torque impulse, now 
represented as a series of harmonics, to the crankshaft system described earlier.  
Returning to the Campbell Diagram (Figure 16.29) a given crankshaft will have various 
natural frequencies – one for each vibration mode described earlier.  Each natural 
frequency can be overlaid as a horizontal line on the Campbell Diagram.  It follows that 
there will be a critical, or resonant speed for every whole and half-order harmonic.  Some 
of these will occur well outside of the operating speed range of the engine.

The torque impulses are being applied at various points along the length of the 
crankshaft, and in a particular sequence based on the engine‘s firing order.  As a result 
some harmonic orders assist one another and increase the vibration amplitude.  These are 
referred to as the major orders.  Others partially cancel one another and are termed minor 
orders.  The major orders tend to be those that are direct multiples of the number of 
torque pulses per revolution.  However, other orders may be important depending on the 
particular crankshaft layout and firing order.  For example, on an in-line six-cylinder 
engine the third and sixth orders might be expected to be important.  The ninth order may 
be important although the magnitude of vibration is typically much lower.  The 4 ½ order 
will also be found important on most in-line six-cylinder engines.  A complete 
explanation is beyond the scope of this book, but lies in the choice of firing order 
resulting in relative high amplitude forces acting over the front versus the back halves of 
the crankshaft at the 4 ½ order.   
As a summary of the concepts just discussed, the third, 4½, sixth, and ninth order 
frequency versus engine speed of the Campbell Diagram are re-plotted in Figure 16.30.  
Overlaid on this diagram are the first- and second-mode natural frequencies of a 
particular crankshaft system.  It can be seen that for this engine resonant speeds for the 
first vibration mode will occur at approximately 2700 rpm (6th order), 3600 rpm (4 ½ 
order), and 5700 rpm (3rd order).  Second mode resonance will occur at 7300 rpm (6th 
order) and 9600 rpm (4½ order).  Note that unless the engine will be run at very high 
speed the third crankshaft vibration mode will not be seen.    
 
 
Figure 16.30: Identification on campbell… 
 
 
Some general trends can be observed in crankshaft geometry. Higher stiffness 
crankshafts have higher natural frequencies which is important for both torsional stresses 
and lateral (axial) vibrations. Low moment of inertial cranks also help raise the natural 
frequencies of system. Conversely, adding counterweights adds to the moment of inertia 
of a crankshaft, lowering the frequency. On multi-throw cranks, such as V-6‘s or V-8‘s, 
shaping of the counterweights is critical to keep the W*R2 low (inertia) and the W*R 
high (counterweight effectiveness). 
For the reasons discussed at the beginning of this section dampening is applied to 
reduce the torsional vibration amplitude in most automotive engines.  Various dampening 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods

techniques can be used but the most common are the untuned viscous shear dampener 
and the tuned harmonic dampener.   
A cross-section of a typical viscous shear dampener is depicted in Figure 16.31 
along with its effect on crankshaft deflection.  The viscous shear dampener consists of a 
ring of mass encased in a cavity filled with a silicon-based fluid.  The casing is rigidly 
bolted to the crankshaft nose, and the mass is free to float in the viscous fluid.  As the 
crankshaft nose experiences a vibration impulse the mass reacts in the opposite direction, 
creating a shear force in the fluid that dampens the vibration impulse.  The vibration 
energy is dissipated as heat energy from the viscous shear.  This type of dampener is 
referred to as untuned because it will dampen the vibration pulses regardless of 
frequency, as can be seen in the plot of Figure 16.31.  The unit must be sized large 
enough to dissipate the vibration energy without overheating, and adequate air flow 
around the dampener must be ensured.  This type of dampener is relatively expensive so 
is generally seen only on larger, higher cost engines.  Because the running clearance is 
quite small it is susceptible to damage. 
 
 
Figure 16.31: Untuned version… 
 
More commonly used in automobiles is the tuned harmonic dampener shown in 
Figure 16.32.  In this design the dampener hub is again rigidly mounted to the crankshaft 
nose, and a seismic mass is then mounted around the hub through a rubber isolator.  The 
combination of the mass and the stiffness of the rubber isolator is tuned to dampen out 
vibration at a particular frequency, as shown in the figure.  It should be noted that each 
order now has two resonant frequencies because the coupled mass acts as a second 
torsional system linked through the rubber isolator.

16.4.4 Crankshaft Nose Development (straight, taper, spline fit) 
 
A cross-section showing an example of the crankshaft nose and the front details 
of the engine are shown in Figure 16.33.  A cam drive gear is fit onto the front of the 
crankshaft and located using a keyway or spline.  From this gear the camshaft will be 
driven using a gear, chain, or belt drive, as discussed further in Chapter 17.  This or an 
adjacent gear may also be used to drive the oil pump and other internal engine drives 
(balancer shafts or a fuel pump are examples).  The crankshaft nose then protrudes 
through the front cover, and the vibration dampener and accessory drive pulleys are 
mounted to the nose. The front oil seal is mounted to the front cover, and either directly 
contacts the crankshaft surface inboard of the dampener, or contacts the dampener hub as 
shown in the figure. 
 
 
Figure 16.33: Crankshaft nose design… 
 
There are three drive options for accessories at the front of the crankshaft: straight 
fit, taper fit, or spline. The torque capacity of each these joints need to be calculated to 
ensure a successful design. The straight fit and taper fit configurations will need a 
keyway, not to handle drive torque, but to ensure timing of the accessories to the

crankshaft. The torque applied to the clamping fastener(s) provides normal force and 
friction in the joint, which provides the torque capacity.  
The objective of the straight fit joint is to design sufficient fastener clampload to 
withstand torsional loading on the crankshaft. Clampload is calculated by dividing the 
fastener torque by the nut factor of the joint and the diameter of the fastener as shown in 
Equation 16.5. Nut factors for steel joints are typically 0.18-0.22, but there is 
considerable variation in actual practice and this formula is an approximation for initial 
sizing purposes. Each of the input values has a tolerance and the nut factor (k) is sensitive 
to over 200 variables, which can affect final values significantly. It is best to design 
prototypes, and then validate the actual nut factor experimentally.

The fastener clampload provides the normal force on the joint, which is then 
multiplied by the coefficient of friction of the two components, the fastener and the hub. 
The resultant tangential friction force is multiplied by the maximum radius of the 
clamped members to calculate the torque capacity in the joint as calculated in Equations 
16.6-16.8 and illustrated in Figure 16.34. The torque capacity in the joint needs to be 
greater than the instantaneous torque expected on the crankshaft.

The objective of the taper fit joint is again to provide sufficient fastener 
clampload (Fclamp) to withstand torsional loading on the crankshaft. However, the taper 
design is benefited by the interference fit generated between shaft and hub. These 
equations are developed from those used for a thick wall pressure vessel, and the 
variables are defined in Figure 16.35. This method assumes that the hub does not bottom 
against a shoulder, and is only supported by the taper. It also assumes that the clamping 
fastener does not bottom on the end surface of the shaft, to ensure that all fastener clamp 
force is going into the hub.

If the calculated Fastener Torque required is higher than the actual value used to

retention is calculated correctly.  
 
A splined joint can transmit more torque for its size than other types of joints as 
shown in Figure 16.36-16.37, and can be used at the nose of the crankshaft to drive 
accessory loads, or more commonly used at the power take off end of the crankshaft to 
drive the vehicle. Spline standards are published as ANSI B92.1 and ANSI B92.2m 
(metric). The objective of a spline is to drive using the teeth on the joint, and does not 
rely primarily on clampload. Several failure modes must be designed for: base shaft 
breakage, hub bursting, teeth of spline shearing off at the pitch line, teeth of the internal 
spline breaking at root due to bending stress, and wear on the drive surface of the flank of 
the spline. Splines can be either ―fixed‖, where there is no relative or rocking motion

between the internal and external teeth as in a clamped joint, or ―flexible‖ where there is 
relative rocking or axial motion. The following information was adapted from When 
Splines Need Stress Control by Darle W. Dudley, Product Engineering, 12/23/57. The 
equations presented below are for fixed splines, since they are most common in 
automotive application, and provide a nine times greater capacity for handling 
compressive stress than flexible splines.

Calculate Torsional Shear Stress (Ss1) for the basic hollow shaft and design margin with 
load factors by applying Equations 16.14-16.15: 
 The rated torque of an engine, usually found on a spec sheet, is the cycle averaged 
torque produced by the engine. In reality, the engine produces much higher 
instantaneous torque during peak cylinder pressure, and must be designed for.  
 The Application Shock Factor (Ka) is typically high for internal combustion engines, 
as compared to turbines or an electric motor, because of this instantaneous torque. 
The fewer number of cylinders, the higher this number will be (2.8 for single or twin 
cylinder). The greater the number of cylinders, the more these instantaneous torque 
spikes will be averaged out (2.0 for 6 cylinders or more).   
 The Fatigue Life Factor (Lf) will again be more severe for internal combustions 
engines as compared to turbines, because fully reverse loading will be experienced 
more often. A light duty automotive engine may experience comparatively few 
severe torque reversals, such as a hard launch-from-rest of the vehicle in first gear. A 
heavy duty truck engine may see many more torque reversals, as the engine is 
operated near its design limit for the majority of engine life.

Calculate Shear Stress in Spline Teeth at pitch diameter, and design margin with load

diameter of an external spline by substituting the minor diameter of the internal 
spline (Di) for the pitch diameter (D), and chordal thickness of the tooth at the 
minor diameter (tx) for the thickness at the pitch diameter (tc).  
 The constant at the beginning of the equation can be modified depending on the 
quality of manufacture of the spline (4 if a less accurate means of manufacture are 
used, and 2 if a higher precision method is used).

best to choose a more coarse pitch of teeth, so that any corrosion of the teeth reduces 
a smaller percentage of the tooth width over time than fine teeth.

hub is of large diameter or the engine operates at high speeds.

The crankshaft nose is subject to high-cycle fatigue loading.  The combination of 
the dampener and pulley mass and accessory drive belts create a resultant force of 
constant magnitude and direction.  As the crankshaft spins each location on its nose 
experiences a complete bending load cycle once every revolution of the shaft.  The 
outside surface of the nose experiences alternating tensile and compressive loads, and the 
threaded mounting hole(s) for the dampener assembly results in local stress 
concentrations, and the threads should be counterbored to mitigate.  Rig testing can be 
readily devised to duplicate this load cycle and provide durability validation.     
 
 
16.4.5 Crankshaft Flange Development 
 
The same rationale just discussed for crankshaft nose loading and durability 
applies to the flywheel mounting flange as well. The flywheel or torque converter flex 
plate are typically mounted to the crankshaft flange using a multiple bolt pattern as 
shown in Figure 16.38. The flywheel connection relies on friction to generate the shear 
torque capacity in the joint, but a frictionless condition must also be designed for. To 
calculate the frictional torque capacity of the bolted joint: 
1. Approximate nominal clampload per fastener 
2. Calculate the shear capacity produced per fastener 
3. Determine the total frictional torque capacity in the joint

5. Calculate the shear stress on a single fastener or locating dowel.  
 
For the first calculation, assume that half of the fasteners are loaded as the shank 
of the bolt contacts the clearance hole in the flywheel. Not all fasteners will share the 
load equally due to manufacturing tolerances, so a higher design margin of two or greater 
is recommended. The shear plane should go through the unthreaded shank of the bolt. If 
not, than the minimum diameter of the thread must be used in the calculation. However, it 
is generally good design practice to keep the fastener threads out of the shear region. For 
the second calculation, assume the entire load is taken up by a single fastener or a 
locating dowel, and that n = 1. A lower design margin of one or more is required since 
other fasteners will actually be loaded. It can sometimes be difficult to find the shear 
yield strength for fastener material, so as a first approximation, the distortion energy 
theory for ductile metals can be used.

In order to increase the frictional torque capacity of the joint, it may be difficult to 
change the fastener pitch circle radius or fastener diameter once a design is in production. 
If it is desired to increase the fastener pitch circle diameter, the main journal diameter 
may need to increase. If the main journal diameter increases, it will increase the bearing 
diameter, seal diameter, cylinder block support web, and oil pan rail width, depending on 
design of the crankshaft.

It is a frequent occurrence that the marketing organization will request an increase 
in engine torque or power shortly after a new design is released to production. This is one 
key area of engine design to package protect for future increases in output!  
If a design is complete and in production, and more torque capacity is required of 
the joint, various treatments can be added to increase the capacity of the joint at an 
additional cost. The coefficient of friction at the joint surface can be increase by changing 
the machined surface finish, by adding abrasive coatings, or by adding additional locating 
dowels. Alternately, the fastener grade may be increased to allow greater clampload.  
Two examples of the rear crankshaft oil seal details are shown in Figure 16.39 
(update figure numbers).  The case on the left incorporates a split seal in the rear main 
bearing.  That on the right uses a continuous seal riding on the flywheel flange.

16.4.6 Cross-drilling of Crankshaft  
 
Crankshafts are typically drilled for many reasons: material removal for 
balancing, material removal for weight reduction, and pressurized oil feed.  
Crankshaft drilling for balance is usually done in the counterweight webs as 
shown in Figure 16.40. This is done when dimensions of the forging or casting of the 
base crankshaft cannot be held close enough to achieve the desired balance, or when a 
lighter piston is introduced that changes the required balance. This area is usually not 
significantly stressed, and so drilling does not present a significant stress concentration. 
These drillings can either be radial, as shown, to remove mass or can occasionally be 
axial in the same location to allow addition of more dense material such as tungsten alloy, 
depleted uranium, or lead. The addition of dense balance weights is more expensive, but 
can make the overall crankshaft lighter though a more efficient use of material (WR), or 
can be used to reduce crankshaft inertia for racing applications (WR2).

Figure 16.40: Crankshaft drilling for balance, oil passages 
    
Crankshaft drilling for weight reduction is typically done in the crankpin. This 
drilling of the crankpin reduces the amount of counterweight material required and can 
make the entire crankshaft lighter. It can also change the local stiffness of the crankpin, to 
better distribute stress in the crankshaft and reduce it in the critical journal fillet region. 
The crankpin is typically a highly loaded area, so attention must be paid to detailed 
design of the cross drilling in this area, and clearance in adjacent counterweights is 
typically required to allow access for this drilling. Frequently, this cross drilling is not 
coaxial to the crankpin. 
If the crankshaft has plain bearings, it will be necessary to provide pressure 
lubrication via internal drilling of the crankshaft. These long drillings typically connect 
the main journal to the crankpin to provide pressurized lube and these internal drilled 
passages come very close the highly loaded crankpin and main journal fillets as 
illustrated in Figures 1.6 and 1.8. If the drilled passage comes close to the surface in a 
highly loaded area, either at a journal fillet or in the crank web, a fatigue crack may 
initiate. Additionally, care must be taken at the location where the drilled hole breaks the 
surface of the journal as this may also create a fatigue crack initiation point. The drilled 
oil hole is typically chamfered where it contacts the journal surface to diffuse stress, and 
also to spread pressurized oil to a larger area under the bearing. One technique to improve 
fatigue resistance is to use a hardened ball, and peen the ID of the chamfer where it meets 
the cross-drilled hole. This will introduce residual compressive stresses in this area and 
reduce a crack initiation site. Finally, the location where the oil hole breaks the surface of 
the crankpin is important for the bearings. It should be located somewhere between 90-
30° BTDC compression stroke to provide the best feed of oil to the bearing. This is the 
point when the load on the bearing is least. Avoid the critical pressure region at 0-45° 
ATDC power stroke, when the high rod loading increases oil pressure above the system 
pressure, and blocks the feed to the bearings.

16.5 Detailed Design of Connecting Rod Geometry 
The connecting rod is most likely the highest stressed component in the engine, 
and load is applied several times on every revolution of the engine. The connecting rod 
must be designed for high cycle fatigue to withstand the high number of engine cycles, 
and also for stiffness in supporting fluid film bearings. The connecting rod transfers the 
gas and inertia loads from the piston to the crankshaft, and experiences high rates of 
loading and direction reversal, high temperatures, and varying degrees of lubrication. 
Axial inertia and connecting rod whip forces (tangential to crank radius) are a function of 
connecting rod weight, so the higher the weight, the higher the forces. Since inertia can 
be a dominant load, and the piston, piston pin, and connecting rod all contribute, a more 
durable connecting rod design might require less material (be lighter) instead of the 
typical approach of adding more material to increase life. The higher the piston and rod 
weight, the more crank counterweight is required, which leads to a heavier engine. As a 
result, rod weight is of primary importance. Value added operations such as shot peening 
to enable a lighter connecting rod may be justified to reduce forces and weight in the rest 
of the powertrain. Piston normal forces due to connecting rod angle and connecting rod 
whip forces are translated to the engine, and require stronger support in the chassis. 
However, when a connecting rod fails, it typically destroys the entire engine similar to a 
crankshaft failure. The desire for minimum weight must be balanced with rod durability, 
and the desire for the least cost manufacturing methods. Connecting rods must also be 
cost effective, manufacturable, and serviceable.  
The engine type has a significant effect on the highest loading. At one extreme is 
the low engine speed and high BMEP diesel, and at the other end is the high engine speed 
and lower BMEP gasoline engine. Gas loading and inertial loading at TDC oppose each 
other, reducing total loading on the connecting rod on the power stroke.  At lower engine 
speeds, the gas forces dominate and put the connecting rod into compression. At higher 
engine speeds, inertial loads may dominate and stress the rod in both tensile and 
compression.  
Connecting rod loads vary as a function of crankshaft angle, and also as a 
function of engine cycle. At TDC-exhaust (overlap) on a 4-stroke engine, the connecting 
rod experiences the highest tension load case because there are very little gas pressure 
forces to resist it. As opposed to TDC-Power stroke, when there will be a combination of 
tensile forces from inertia, and compressive forces from combustion. At BDC-exhaust, 
the inertia forces put the rod into compression.  
The maximum tensile forces on the connecting rod occur at TDC-Exhaust as 
illustrated in Equation 16.31. Gas pressure forces can be neglected since they are near 
zero during valve overlap.

Notice that these equations are a function of the Connecting rod ratio (λ), 
Equation 16.33. As the connecting rod grows compared to the engine stroke, it has the 
tendency to reduce the peak force on the rod, and also the peak piston thrust force. 
However, a longer connecting rod has more weight and increases the engine deck height. 
These conflicting requirements must be balanced. Typical conrod ratios are:

The main beam of the connecting rod is subject to inertial bending forces (rod 
whip) as it swings through TDC. For an initial analysis, it is assumed that the connecting 
rod is a simply supported beam, subject to a linearly varying distributed load as shown in 
Figure 16.41. Once the connecting rod geometry is complete, FEA can be performed and 
the load can be spread to all of the elements of the beam in proportion to their distance 
from the piston pin end.

Since gas pressure loading dominates at low engine speed, the rod must be 
designed for compression. There is also a high compressive load at BDC due to inertia at 
high engine speed. In addition to designing for compressive stress, column buckling must 
also be considered and in high BMEP Diesel engines this is a very important 
consideration. The rod can buckle in one of two directions, parallel to the plane of 
connecting rod motion, and perpendicular to it as shown in Figure 16.42-16.43.  
 
Figure 16.42: Buckling parallel to plane of motion 
Figure 16.43: Buckling perpendicular to plane of motion 
 
The end constraint on the connecting rod significantly influences its buckling 
resistance. If the rod is pinned at either end the least resistance to buckling is present, and 
if the rod is fixed in six degrees of freedom at either end the most resistance to buckling 
is present. Depending on the exact end constraint, the column is said to have an 
equivalent length (Le) to a column pinned at both ends. Column buckling is also sensitive 
to the geometry of the cross-section, and it is assumed the connecting rod beam has a

constant cross section (if a tapered rod beam is present, proceed to FEA). The geometry 
is described by means of a slenderness ratio in Equation 16.37, which is the equivalent 
length of the column divided by the radius of gyration:

s
Slendernes

 
 
 
 
 
 
(16.37) 
 
Where: 
 
Le = Equivalent length of the column 
ρ = Radius of gyration 
 
For the buckling condition parallel to the plane of connecting rod motion, the 
connecting rod is considered pined-pined or free-free, resulting in an equivalent column 
length of Le = 1.0L. For the buckling condition perpendicular to the plan of connecting 
rod motion, the crankpin and piston pin limit rotation of the column at its constraints. 
This is a fixed-fixed condition and the equivalent column length is Le = 0.5L 
Now that the equivalent column length and slenderness ratio are defined, we may 
investigate the equations describing the critical compressive load which the column can 
sustain without becoming elastically unstable. First the compressive stress is evaluated, 
which is the maximum inertial force due to the piston and reciprocating portion of the rod 
mass, and the gas pressure force. The stress must be below yield in order for the column 
buckling formulas to be valid via Equation 16.38.

Next, either the Euler column buckling or J.B. Johnson Parabola method are used, 
depending on the slenderness ratio. While the axial compressive stress must be designed 
for fatigue resistance, the critical unit load of column buckling (Scr) is a function of 
geometry and not material limits. The critical buckling stress at which the column 
becomes elastically unstable does not directly relate to yield or fatigue strength.

16.5.1 Connecting Rod Crankpin Bore Cylindricity 
 
As we progress down the length of the connecting rod, different design criteria are 
required. The crankpin end of the connecting rod is primarily designed for stiffness and 
not strength, as the connecting rod needs to support the crankpin journal bearing and 
maintain roundness. As the engine progresses through its cycle, tensile inertia forces 
attempt to stretch the rod and deform the crankpin end of the connecting rod, as shown in 
Figure 16.45. Stretching of the connecting rod along the cylinder bore causes the 
connecting rod to pinch in along the cap split due to the Poisson effect, which may lead to 
the oil film breaking down and the bearing contacting the crankshaft. If rolling element 
bearings are used, pinching of the rolling elements may occur leading to skidding or 
spalling.  
 
 
Figure 16.45: Deformed shape of crankpin bearing bore 
 
Since downward compressive forces load the upper half of the bearing, and not 
the bottom half, only tensile forces are considered. Now, both the upper half and lower 
half of the rod mass are counted for inertial calculations. At TDC exhaust, the entire 
rod/piston system is creating a force away from the crank equal to the reciprocating force 
and the rotating force from the lower end of the rod as shown in Equation 16.44. This 
force is reacted by the lower end of the connecting rod.  In high speed engines, this can

be the limiting load on the connecting rod because of ovalization of the crankpin bore, 
bolt limits, or cap strength.

 In order to achieve a true deflected shape, the bearing press fit and support from 
the fluid film or rolling element bearing must be incorporated in this analysis. It is 
important to work with the bearing manufacturer to establish limits of cylindricity.  
 
As can be derived from Figure 16.45 above, the outer most surface of the split 
line has the largest stress. This is because as the rod cap is loaded in tension, the bolt 
flange will rotate about this outmost line of contact. As this line of contact is moved 
further away from the crankpin bore, the lever arm increases on the flange, and the unit 
load decreases. For this reason, most connecting rods have additional material added 
outboard of this flange to decrease unit loading and increase flange stiffness. Ideally the 
connecting rod bolt would be as close to the bore as possible, to reduce this flange 
rotation due to cantilever. A starting value for bolt diameter tied to cylinder bore diameter 
would be as shown in Equation 16.45:

16.5.2 Connecting Rod-to-Cap Alignment 
 
Connecting rod-to-cap alignment is critical to a successful rod design, and 
ensuring crankpin journal bearing life. Angular split lines present more of a challenge 
because of the direction of the applied forces in relation to the split line, but are 
sometimes necessary to aid in service of the engine in the vehicle.  
 
Some alignment methods are: 
 
Increased Shank Fastener, increased shank diameter at split line, to provide alignment 
 
Ring Dowels, coaxial with the fastener in a counterbore, similar in function to 
increased shank fastener.  
 
Separate Dowel Pins, dowel pins next to the connecting rod bolt. 
 
Serration, specially machined rod-to-cap split surface. 
 
Stepped surface, specially machined rod-to-cap split surface. 
 
Cracked, manufactured by cracking the end of the rod off by force at either room 
temperature, or frozen.  
 
Each method has pros and cons, which is why there are so many methods in use. 
The increased shank fastener is inexpensive to manufacture and is compact in design, 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods

B. Dondlinger 
however if the alignment deviates from ideal there may be interference between the bolt 
and rod at the split line. This may add bending stress to the bolt, or upset material in the 
rod into the bearing bore and degrade circularity. Ring dowels are very similar in 
performance, with the added disadvantage of moving the rod bolt further away from the 
bearing bore. For packaging reasons, this may increase the overall rod size. Separate 
dowel pins are inexpensive, but may also increase the size of the connecting rod and add 
weight.  
A serrated or stepped surface between the connecting rod and cap is more 
expensive to manufacture due to the increased sensitivity to manufacturing tolerances, 
but this type increases the shear resistance in the rod-to-cap joint. Stepped surface rod 
caps operate in a similar manner, using a lip to limit cap motion. Angle split rods increase 
the amount of shear force on the joint, and typically use these types of alignment.  
 
The cracked design is used in high volume production, in both forged and 
powdered metal (PM) rods.  This method is cheap, repeatable, insensitive to tolerances, 
and alignment and shear resistance are excellent. There is very low distortion of the split 
surface, since both surfaces are symmetrical. However this method dictates the parent 
material of the connecting rod, and may limit the choice of manufacturer since high 
production volumes are typically needed to justify the expense of special equipment to 
form and crack the rod.  
 
 
16.5.3 Calculating Connecting Rod Bushing and Journal Bearing 
Press Fit 
The small end, or pin end of the connecting rod is almost invariably a continuous 
bearing surface – no separation plane is needed as the piston pin can be inserted through 
the connecting rod from either side.  Two designs are commonly seen for retaining the 
piston pin.  One is the fixed pin, where the pin is pressed into the connecting rod bore, 
and rotates freely in the piston pin bore.  The other is the floating pin, where the piston 
pin is free to rotate in both the piston and connecting rod bores, and is held in place with 
snap rings fitted in grooves on both outer edges of the piston pin bore.  The fixed pin 
reduces cost and weight but has lower load carrying capability and requires special 
assembly provisions.  The degree of required press fit generally requires the connecting 
rod to be heated.  Because the connecting rod does not provide an acceptable bearing 
surface the floating pin requires the addition of a bushing to the connecting rod.  This and 
the required snap rings and machined grooves significantly increases cost relative to the 
fixed pin.  Traditionally the floating pin was seen only in high performance and heavy-
duty engines, but due to the demand for increased loads it is now being adopted in many 
engines. 
 
Interference fits are used to retain the piston pin bushing, as well as the crankpin 
journal bearing. Both are based on the same fundamentals of thick walled pressure 
vessels, but their application and assembly method are different. This requires different 
approaches to design. The thick wall pressure vessel equations are valid as long as the 
wall thickness-to-radius ratio is greater than 0.1.  
 
Bearing press fits must be designed for operating loads, but also extremes of 
temperature. The goal is to have sufficient press fit to retain the bearing in its bore under

all operating conditions as presented in Table 16.2, while not exceeding the stress limits 
for the given materials. It may also be useful to use these equations to predict assembly 
press force at room temperature.

Depending on the material used for the housing and the material used for the 
bushing, differential thermal expansion may help or hurt the design. For a low thermal 
expansion coefficient housing (steel) and a high thermal expansion coefficient bushing 
(aluminum), the ―X‘s‖ represent the extreme conditions to evaluate. For a high thermal 
expansion coefficient housing (aluminum) and a low thermal expansion coefficient 
bushing (steel), the ―Y‘s‖ represent the extreme conditions to evaluate.  
 
The minimum temperature conditions may exist while the vehicle is being stored, 
but not when the vehicle is being operated. So the minimum press fit retention may be 
violated if it is known that the vehicle will not be operated at these conditions. An 
example would be a motorcycle or lawn mower, which are not typically operated below 
5°C, but may be stored in an unheated garage down to -30°C.   
Figure 16.46 is an example of a representative automotive connecting rod, with 
input values listed in Table 16.3-16.4. This is a steel connecting rod with a Nickel-
Aluminum-Bronze (C63000) bushing pressed in.

The steps used to calculate the stress in the pressed members are:  
1. Check thick wall assumption is valid. 
2. Assume a starting value of interference fit.  
3. Calculate circumferential (hoop) stress and radial stress. Longitudinal stress 
assumed = 0 if members are the same length. 
4. Calculate the diametral strain. 
5. Solve for P, and calculate the fit pressure.

Use the distortion energy failure criterion for the limit of design, assuming ductile 
materials. The maximum stress for both the internal and external members occurs at their 
inner surfaces. To improve the accuracy of the final analysis for not circular components, 
apply FEA. Also, it is important to evaluate these same equations at the limits of the 
component tolerances, since a design may be acceptable at nominal tolerance, but not 
acceptable at a least material condition.

As the temperature and size of the components change, so will the press fit. Every 
element of the material expands with increasing temperature, and each element moves 
outward from its original position, so a hole bored in a solid will increase in diameter. 
The math for this follows the equation for linear thermal expansion, and is applied to the 
circumference of the hole in Equation 16.59:

The final hoop stress on the crankpin end of the rod is developed in much the 
same way as the press fit bushing example above, except the bearing is split into two 
different pieces for installation in the upper rod and cap. The diameter of the journal 
bearing is slightly larger than the bore in the connecting rod (or main bearing), and is 
compressed during installation. Since the bearing is neither uniform in thickness, or 
constant in radius, a direct measurement of the diameter is misleading. A different

method of measurement is required to describe the press fit. This is called crush height 
and is measured by the overstand test, the amount of which affects the press fit. The 
overstand test consists of placing the bearing shell in a half circle gauge, flush at one end 
and extending above the other. The amount the shell protrudes from the gauge is the 
amount of circumferential crush the bearing will be under when assembled. A complete 
description of the overstand test is listed in: 
 ISO 3548: Plain bearings — Thin-walled half bearings with or without flange — 
Tolerances, design features and methods of test. 
 ISO 6524: Plain bearings — Thin-walled half bearings — Checking of peripheral 
length. 
The crush height is measured under a gauge force. This is effectively measuring 
the circumference or length of the journal bearing shell, rather than diameter. A bearing 
with sufficient crush height ensures that the bearing is preloaded enough to have uniform 
contact with the housing. This ensures good heat transfer from the bearing to the housing, 
and prevents fretting. Typical values of the crush height of automotive bearings are 0.05-
0.10mm. 
The theoretical basis for calculating the bearing crush is a thick column in 
compression, applying Equation 16.63. This column is curved into a shell. Column 
buckling can be ignored since the bearing is supported by the housing in the installed 
state.

Typically, the entire connecting rod is not analyzed. A half model with symmetry, 
or even a quarter model, is used. The mesh is typically refined around the bolted joint 
area, and around critical fillets and transitions. The connecting rod is analyzed in the 
following steps. 
Apply the assembly load cases by applying the bolt preload to the connecting rod 
cap. Incorporate the deformations into the initial geometry of the model to simulate 
machining of the crankpin bore when clamped together. Apply the bushing and bearing 
assembly load cases by simulating the interference due to press fit of piston pin bushing 
and crankpin journal bearings. 
Analyze the dynamic load cases produced by the engine by applying maximum 
tensile load at TDC-Exhaust stroke and maximum compressive at BDC-Power stroke. 
The piston pin and crankpin are modeled as separate cylinders and used as boundary 
conditions since they contribute to the overall system stiffness. Finally, analyze loading 
due to rod whip. 
The last step of the analysis is to evaluate the connecting rod for critical column 
buckling in the plane of connecting rod motion, and perpendicular to it. This enables a 
more refined solution to the analytical method, since detailed geometry is represented.  
 
 
16.6 Detailed Design of Flywheel Geometry 
 
The purpose of the engine flywheel is to smooth the cyclical speed variation of 
the engine within a given engine revolution. It absorbs energy during the power stroke, 
and distributes it during the exhaust, intake, and compression strokes. The transmission 
of instantaneous torque spikes developed by the engine will be reduced to the driveline.  
The flywheel or torque converter mass is important in controlling idle speed 
fluctuation within limits acceptable to the driver. As speed increases fluctuations become 
much less apparent and the need for this mass decreases.  An acceptable idle speed 
fluctuation limit is identified and flywheel mass is chosen to be sufficient to reduce 
fluctuation within that limit.  Additional mass beyond the minimum required will 
penalize the engine‘s response to transient requirements. 
 
This storage and release of energy has other uses in the engine and the vehicle, 
when the engine average speed changes. Large flywheel inertia will enable a low engine 
idle speed. A low engine idle speed, by reducing the total number of revolutions the 
engine makes at idle, will reduce fuel consumption and improve emissions during an 
engine operating regime that does little useful work. The lower the speed variation, the 
easier it is to calibrate the fuel injection at low engine speeds as the piston approach to 
TDC is more consistent.  
Like in heavy machinery, the flywheel will allow sudden loads to be placed on the 
engine without stalling it. This is helpful when starting a vehicle from rest, or during 
sudden load changes. The inertia of the flywheel can be balanced against the inertia of the 
vehicle. A large engine flywheel will also make the engine less responsive during 
transient drive modes, as the engine will not accelerate quickly with the application of 
throttle and will not decelerate quickly during coasting/sail or removal of the throttle. 
This may have a beneficial affect in a work truck or for cruising on the highway at steady 
speeds, but may not be desirable in a sports car where quick engine response is desired.

Additionally, in most applications, it serves as the power take off location and 
usually as a means for the starter drive of the engine. 
In many cases the flywheel and crankshaft are balanced as a unit, and a non-
symmetric bolt circle or locating dowel is used to ensure that if the flywheel is removed it 
is again mounted in the same position.  The clutch disc and pressure plate are then 
mounted to the flywheel with a series of cap screws around the perimeter of the pressure 
plate.  A pilot bearing or bushing mounted in the rear of the crankshaft at the shaft 
centerline supports the nose of the transmission input shaft.  In transverse installations 
this shaft may not feed directly into the transmission, but drives a chain that then transfers 
load to the transmission. 
In the case of an automatic transmission a flex plate, bolted to the same bolt circle 
on the crankshaft flange, replaces the flywheel.  The torque converter is then bolted to the 
flex plate with three or four bolts near its perimeter.    
 
 
16.6.1 Calculating Flywheel Inertia Effect on Cyclical Speed, 
Energy Storage 
 
Equation 16.70 for Kinetic Energy stored in a flywheel is shown below, and is 
equivalent to the amount of energy release if the flywheel speed changed from current to 
a full stop:

Where: 
E = Energy stored in the flywheel 
I = Polar moment of inertia 
ω = Rotational velocity  
W = Weight of flywheel rim 
v = Linear velocity at mean radius  
 
Typically, a flywheel is designed to reduce the speed fluctuation to a desired 
amount. This is measured in percent change in speed called the Coefficient of Fluctuation 
(Cf) as represented in Equation 16.71, or in absolute speed change. For engines, this is 
typically between 2-5%. If a lower speed fluctuation is desired, a larger flywheel will be 
required. However, the larger the flywheel, the more difficult to package and the heavier 
the engine will be. Since the flywheel is usually directly coupled to the crankshaft, it is 
not possible to spin the flywheel faster than engine speed, removing this as a design 
option. To gain smoothness, the flywheel diameter or thickness will need to be increased. 
Generally I~mr2, so a thin disc of large diameter would have most efficient use of 
material, and a hub with most material concentrated near the rim would be even better. 
Typically dense materials such as steel or cast iron are used for flywheels.

The traditional method for calculating the required amount of energy in the 
flywheel is to determine the peak energy needed by the work operation and subtract the 
average energy provided by the engine or motor providing energy input, and the 
difference is the flywheel energy needed to maintain speed as represented in Equation 
16.78. This method is relevant to the vehicle side, as a load is applied to the vehicle, the 
required flywheel inertia to maintain engine speed can be calculated.

16.6.2 Calculating Burst Strength of Flywheels 
 
The design limit of flywheels varies by geometry, material, and speed of 
flywheel. Assuming the flywheel is a hub or hollow cylinder as illustrated in Figure

16.47, maximum tangential and maximum radial stress can be calculated using 
Equations 16.81-16.82. The maximum tangential stress will occur at the inner diameter, 
and the maximum radial stress will occur at the geometric mean radius, √(rori).

16.6.3 Calculating Critical Speeds of Shafts or Whirl of Flywheels 
 
If the engine is to be used in a configuration where the crankshaft and 
transmission input shaft are not co-axial, in other words where the crankshaft and 
transmission input shaft are connected by a gear pair, the critical speed of the shaft under 
radial load must be considered. This is different than the critical speed under torsional 
load. All rotating shafts have a slight imbalance, and at a critical speed the flywheel no 
longer rotates about its geometric axis but about the true center of gravity, known as 
whirl. Critical speeds of shafts are outside the scope of this book, but must be considered 
in detailed design and analysis.  
Considering weight, speed, and energy are contained in a flywheel. It is typical 
practice to utilize higher design margins when designing a flywheel. It is also important 
to evaluate the sensitivity of the stress to various input parameters. A lower design

margin can be used for material properties, since the relationship is linear, however speed 
is a function squared so the design margin is more sensitive to this parameter.  
 
 
16.7 Crankshaft and Connecting Rod Construction  
 
16.7.1 Crankshaft Materials 
 
Crankshafts are typically cast or forged out of iron or steel. Many types of cast 
iron are used from gray iron, to malleable iron, to nodular iron. The classic tradeoff is one 
of cost versus strength. Typically cast gray iron would be used for low output engines 
such as lawn care, while high output engines such as race cars or diesel trucks would use 
forged steel.  For low volume production, crankshafts are occasionally machined from 
steel billets, but this is the most expensive manufacturing method due to long machining 
times. 
Crankshaft steels are typically medium carbon (.3-.4 percent) and heat treated to 
125-150 ksi tensile strength. Forged crankshafts have better material strength due to grain 
flow. Cast iron alloys vary over a wide range from 30-120 ksi tensile strength depending 
on material and heat treat, and their values can be found in many references. 
While the merits of cast versus forged can be compared, component geometry 
often dictates the method chosen.  It is easier to forge a crankshaft that has all of its 
crankpins in the same plane, such as a single-cylinder or inline-four cylinder, because this 
allows a simple open and shut die. Cross-plane crankshafts such as Figure 16.48 can be 
forged, but more material removal is often required. A cast crankshaft can more easily 
handle a cross-plane crank geometry while reducing the total amount of machine stock 
removal required.  
Casting a crankshaft can enable other desirable geometry for little cost, such as 
hollow crankpins and detailed shaping of the counterweight webs. The development of 
the metallurgy and casting methods has allowed the use of cast cranks in more and more 
applications. Where packaging dimensions are not strictly constrained, cast crankshafts 
can be a reasonable alternative to forged steel shafts.

Directly consult a casting or forging supplier for custom alloys, heat treat options, 
and local geometry properties. This is a changing field influencing crankshaft design, and 
is an area where the state of the art in crankshaft design is developing.  
 
 
16.7.2 Crankshaft Manufacturing  
 
Crankshafts are usually manufactured through several operations. They proceed 
from casting or forging, to rough machining, to finish machining, to grinding, to 
polishing. Depending on the material chosen or application, heat treat processes may be 
involved and additional value added operations may be employed.  
The direction of rotation in the engine is important to the grinding and polishing 
operations if plain journal bearings are used. When the grinding operation is performed 
on the crankpin and main journal surfaces, the metal removal process smears the material 
at the surface. This smearing of the metal raises small burrs or whiskers as shown in 
Figure 16.49, and can be thought of as a circular saw blade in cross section. If these 
whiskers remain on the finished crank, they will have a tendency to scrape the bearings 
on startup, and lead to premature wear. This is important during solid lubrication and 
mixed lubrication at engine startup, prior to the development of the full oil film. 
Therefore it is important to specify the direction of rotation on the crankshaft drawing. 
The bearing journals are ground opposite to rotation direction, and polishing is done in 
the direction of rotation, to encourage the whiskers to fold down upon rotation. 
 
 
Figure 16.49: Illustration of burrs on shaft 
 
An additional consideration in the design of crankshafts is access for the journal 
grinding wheel. This grinding wheel is often many times the diameter of the crankpin, to 
allow unobstructed access to the journal bearings, but still clearance can become a 
limitation. In addition to clearance for the journal bearings, access may be needed to 
manufacture splines or timing gears made integral to the shaft. 
Finally, for extreme applications or applications where the loading will be 
increased on an existing engine design, steps may be taken to increase crankshaft strength 
in the critical fillet transitions. These value added operations are ion nitriding, shot 
peening, induction hardening, and fillet rolling or roll hardening as summarized in Figure 
16.50. These operations locally increase the strength of the crankshaft by modifying the 
material properties or introducing compressive residual stresses. These additional 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods

16-57

operations cost additional money, and careful design can often avoid their requirement. 
However, the designer must compare added cost to processing of the crankshaft, to the 
larger implications to the engine and vehicle downstream. In order to increase the power 
output of the engine, these processes can be added without having to redesign the engine. 
Enabling smaller journal diameters can reduce engine friction. These operations can be 
beneficial when considering the system as a whole.   
 
 
Figure 16.50: Comparison of metal improvement techniques 
 
 
16.7.3 Connecting Rod Materials  
 
Several different materials and processes are used to make connecting rods. 
Historically rods have been cast, forged, or machined from billet. Recently, connecting 
rods have been manufactured from forged powdered metal (PM) for high volume 
automotive applications. This process can be lower cost, enabling more consistent parts 
and a beneficial rod cap alignment surface. Heavy duty engines still primarily use 
forgings. 
The materials used are cast iron, steel, aluminum, and titanium. Cast iron is 
typically used in cost sensitive applications, with forged steel being used in high load 
applications. Aluminum connecting rods are being used in light duty engine applications, 
and recent improvements in metallurgy have increased the suitability of this material. 
Recall from above that the connecting rods own weight acts against itself in high RPM 
applications, so lighter materials enable higher RPM. Expensive Titanium is typically 
reserved for racing applications, due to cost.  
 
 
16.7.4 Connecting Rod Manufacturing  
 
Connecting rods are typically manufactured using several steps. They proceed 
from casting or forging, to rough machining of the upper rod and rod cap separately. 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods 
9/2/2015 
16-58 
B. Dondlinger 
These two components are then bolted together for the finish machining of the assembly 
and precision honing of the bores. It is important to perform this precision machining in 
the assembled state, as bolt clamp loads will distort the big end bearing shape, and 
cylindricity is key to fluid film bearing life. Occasionally, the piston pin bushing and 
crankpin journal bearing are assemble to the rod, and an additional boring and honing 
operation is performed if a higher class of tolerance is to be maintained.   
Frequently, value added operations are applied to the connecting rod to increase 
component life, or reduce component weight. Trimming of a casting or forged connecting 
rod blank will often leave score marks in the finished part. These score marks can act as 
stress risers in the key loaded areas of the connecting rod. They may be ground or 
polished smooth to reduce the stress concentrations. Additionally, shot peening of the 
connecting rod will introduce compressive residual stresses in the component. While 
these operations add cost, the designer must balance this against the potential added 
benefit to the engine and vehicle. If these value added operations are used to reduce 
component weight, the following benefits result: 
 reducing reciprocating inertial forces on the engine, 
 reducing the amount of counterweight needed in the crank counterweight,  
 reducing the vibration transmitted to the vehicle, improving NVH,  
 reducing the amount of support structure needed in the vehicle.  
Additional cost spent here has a leveraging affect on reducing weight and cost elsewhere 
in the vehicle.  
 
 
16.7.5 Typical Bearing Journal Tolerances 
 
There are a number of factors influencing the required bearing clearance, and the 
tolerance required to achieve this. The material of the cylinder block, connecting rod, and 
crankshaft will affect the overall system stiffness; and the geometry of each component 
will affect the component stiffness and individual contribution. The overall engine 
geometry, such as rod-to-stroke ratio or bore-to-stroke ratio, and engine combustion 
pressure will affect component loading. The maximum engine operating speed and 
weight of piston assembly and connecting rod assembly, will affect engine inertial 
loading. The surface finish of the bores will affect the fluid film bearings, as local high 
spots will decrease film thickness. The surface finish of the supporting bores will affect 
contact area with shell bearings, and will impact fretting at the mating surfaces. Oil 
viscosity and additive packages and oil pressure will affect film strength. The number of 
cylinders in the engine, bearing bore-to-bore alignment becomes more important the 
longer the crankshaft and more bearings are used. Finally, engine operating and storage 
temperatures will affect bearing clearances, especially if different materials are used for 
crankshaft, connecting rods, and cylinder block and differential thermal effects take 
place. It is best to consult the bearing manufacturer for installed bearing clearances. Some 
representative starting values are shown in Table 16.5.

16.8 Analysis and Test 
 
The typical analysis path is to evaluate each component individually, and then 
once a level of maturity is reach, combine the individual components into a system 
model. The crankshaft analysis typically starts with analysis of a simply supported, single 
throw. Once that is complete, a full crankshaft model is analyzed. Often a course mesh 
model of the crankshaft is analyzed to determine system natural frequencies for torsional 
calculations. Then the crankshaft, connecting rod, and cylinder block are combined in a 
system analysis. This is typically more complex, as the fluid film must be modeled as gap 
elements. Some system stiffness is contributed by the crankshaft, and some by the 
cylinder block.  
There are two opposing design philosophies for crankshaft-cylinder block design, 
one of cylinder block guided stiffness, and another of crankshaft guided stiffness. Each of 
the different methods has one component significantly stiffer than the other. Regardless 
of method chosen, the goal is to have sympathetic deflection in the same direction 
between the housing and the shaft, to prevent edge loading of the bearings. 
 
 
16.8.1 Description of boundary conditions, constraints 
 
Often for a first analysis, a simply supported crankshaft throw is evaluated at 
location of peak cylinder pressure, and peak inertial load cases. The mesh is refined in the 
critical fillet transitions to the journal bearings. A simply supported boundary condition at 
the midspan of the journal bearing will allow the crankshaft journal to tip in the bearing 
bore of the cylinder block as illustrated in Figure 16.51. This tipping will tend to over-
predict the stress in the crankshaft fillets.

The next level of refinement will add gap elements to simulate the fluid film 
bearings as indicated in Figure 16.52. This analysis takes into account the stiffness 
contribution of the cylinder block.   
 
 
Figure 16.52: Analysis of crankshaft with fluid film bearings and housing. 
 
If further refinement is required, the crankshaft and connecting rod loads are 
evaluated for a full 720° cycle for a four-stroke engine.  This is important for fatigue 
calculations, as the loads fully reverse several times in the four stroke cycle.  
 
 
16.8.2 Component Testing 
 
If a crankshaft or connecting rod fails during engine testing, the results are usually 
catastrophic! If either component fails, many engine components are damaged beyond 
repair: crankshaft, cylinder block, connecting rod, cylinder head, valvetrain, etc. For this 
reason, crankshafts and connecting rods are typically subjected to component tests to 
prove their reliability, prior to exposing an expensive prototype engine to destruction. 
Various servo-hydraulic rigs are used for component level testing. The crankshaft 
is usually evaluated for torsional strength and bending resistance at the crankpin. For 
torsional testing, it is usually supported at the main bearings, fixed at the power take off, 
and a firing pressure load applied at the crankpin for torsional testing. The bending load 
at the crankpin can either be simulated by fixing the crank near TDC and loading via a 
driven connecting rod, or can be subjected to moment by bending the crankshaft from 
one main bearing to another as represented in Figure 16.53. A single throw section is 
rigidly mounted in a heavy fixture that is then suspended as shown. By making the fixture 
mass large it will resonate at a very high natural frequency.  Once this frequency is 
identified high fillet stress can be achieved with a very low driving force.  Strain gauges 
Crankshafts and Connecting Rods

B. Dondlinger 
are added in the fillet region to drive the testing apparatus, or to assess the impact and 
sensitivity of different fillet radii under a given load. By varying the magnitude of 
loading at this frequency an ‗S-N‘ diagram can be generated specific to the crankshaft 
section.  The cycle accumulation rate is so high that the number of cycles the crankshaft 
would accumulate over its entire life in an engine can be accumulated in a matter of 
hours.  The ‗S-N‘ diagram results can be compared with the actual stresses seen by the 
crankshaft in the engine to determine the actual fatigue life.  The rig test method 
described here is so easily done that it can be used for production quality checking as 
well.  Production samples can be tested and overlaid on the ‗S-N‘ diagram to quickly 
identify shifts that might occur due to casting or forging problems, material alloy 
changes, or grinding, hardening, shot peening, or cold rolling process control problems. 
  
 
Figure 16.53: Rig test for… 
 
Connecting rods are usually less sophisticated to test. A load is applied at the 
piston pin bushing, axial to the main beam of the rod. The crankpin end of the rod is fixed 
by a shaft of the same diameter of the crankpin to limit bore distortion. These tests are 
sometimes accelerated by inputting a force at the natural frequency of the component. An 
enhancement of this test is to mount the crankpin end of the rod off center from the piston 
pin end, and this can simulate axial as well as bending load due to rod whip as presented 
in Figure 16.54.

Once individual component testing is passed, system level tests can begin. These 
can again be servo-hydraulic, where a hydraulic cylinder applies load to simulate 
combustion to a short block assembly of crankshaft, connecting rods, and cylinder block. 
Or, the short block can be rotated on a motoring rig, where the engine is spun by an 
electric motor without combustion taking place. This also allows the verification of the 
lubrication and breathing systems, and the measurement of engine friction. A 
disadvantage of a motoring rig test is the lack of combustion forces. This will under-
represent the force due to combustion, but will amplify the loading due to inertia since 
gas forces will not counteract inertia during TDC power stroke.  
These system level tests allow easier access to components for strain 
measurement. The use of strain gages and telemetry or slip rings are also methods to 
obtain information. Finally, a specialty device known as a ―grasshopper linkage‖ can be 
used to take direct measurement of strain on a moving connecting rod. This is a two link 
assembly with one end attached to the connecting rod, and one end attached to a fixed 
point in the engine. This removes the need to have strain gauge wires rotate around the 
crankshaft, and once assembled and moving resembles the rear leg of a grasshopper.  
Once these components have completed testing, they are cleared for use on the 
engine dyno. Typically, low speeds are evaluated first, and load and RPM are gradually 
increased as confidence grows.
