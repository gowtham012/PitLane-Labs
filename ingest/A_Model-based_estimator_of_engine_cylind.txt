A Model-Based Estimator of Engine Cylinder Pressure Imbalance for
Combustion Feedback Control Applications
Ahmed Al-Durra, Lisa Fiorentini, Marcello Canova and Stephen Yurkovich
Abstract— One of the principal issues of low-temperature
combustion modes is caused by the imbalances in the dis-
tribution of air and EGR across the cylinders, which affects
the combustion process. Cylinder to cylinder variations lead to
imbalances in the cylinder pressure, indicated torque, exhaust
gas thermodynamic conditions and emissions.
In principle, a cylinder-by-cylinder control approach could
compensate for air, residuals and charge temperature im-
balance. However, in order to fully beneﬁt from closed-loop
combustion control, a feedback from each engine cylinder
would be necessary to reconstruct the pressure trace. Therefore,
cylinder imbalance is an issue that can be detected only in
a laboratory environment, wherein each engine cylinder is
instrumented with a dedicated pressure transducer.
This paper describes the framework and preliminary results
of a model-based estimation approach to predict the individual
pressure traces in a multi-cylinder engine from the output of
a crankshaft speed sensor. The objective of the estimator is
to reconstruct the complete pressure trace during an engine
cycle with sufﬁcient accuracy to allow for detection of cylinder
to cylinder imbalances. Starting from a model of the engine
crankshaft dynamics, a sliding mode observer is designed
to estimate the cylinder pressure from the crankshaft speed
ﬂuctuation measurement. The results obtained by the estimator
are compared with experimental data obtained on a four-
cylinder Diesel engine.
I. INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, Diesel engine technology has rapidly
evolved due to the signiﬁcant advances in turbocharging, fuel
injection systems, combustion optimization and aftertreat-
ment technology. However, well designed and calibrated
control strategies must be implemented to manage the fueling
system and air handling system, while relying on a restricted
set of sensors due to cost limitations [1].
Conventional Diesel engines typically operate in open loop
with respect to combustion. As emissions and diagnostic
regulations have become more stringent, the possibility of
closed-loop combustion control has recently gained interest.
In particular, the possibility of controlling the individual
fuel injectors could help compensate for several sources
of variability, such as the air and residual mass imbalance
that occurs between cylinders and leads to differences in
cylinder pressure traces, engine torque and emissions [2],
[3]. However, in order to fully beneﬁt from closed-loop
combustion control, it is necessary to obtain feedback from
each engine cylinder to reconstruct the pressure trace [4].

Processing cylinder pressure data for real-time applica-
tions requires several operations to be performed in order
to eliminate the noise and offset issues associated with the
output of piezoelectric transducers [5]. Furthermore, due to
cost issues, the use of a dedicated piezoelectric transducer for
each engine cylinder is today limited to laboratory testing.
For this reason, estimation techniques have been proposed
to detect the in-cylinder pressure from other engine variables,
such as the engine crankshaft speed ﬂuctuations [6], [7].
Several methods have been proposed in the past, mainly for
indicated torque, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP)
estimation and for combustion diagnostics, [6], [8]–[12].
Although the results presented in literature appear accurate
for reconstructing the cylinder pressure and indicated torque
during the combustion event, it is very difﬁcult to design an
estimator able to provide the cylinder pressure trace during
an entire engine cycle (hence including the charge exchange
phase), as well as to detect cylinder to cylinder pressure
imbalances due to the air and EGR distribution.
This work proposes a model-based estimation methodol-
ogy to obtain the pressure trace in a multi-cylinder Diesel en-
gine with real-time capabilities and minimal sensor require-
ments. The outcome of this work is an algorithm intended for
implementation into a closed-loop control system utilizing
cylinder pressure feedback to compensate for imbalances due
to air and EGR distribution across the cylinders.
II. STRUCTURE OF ENGINE TORQUE DYNAMICS MODEL
In its simplest form, the proposed estimation scheme
utilizes the engine crankshaft speed sensor output to predict
the pressure trace for each individual cylinder. Information
from other sensors (such as the fuel mass ﬂow rate and intake
manifold pressure) is also used in the estimation algorithm.
Following the approach proposed in [5], a dynamic model
of the in-cylinder processes based on the energy conservation
principle is here applied to predict the cylinder pressure from
intake valve closing to exhaust valve opening (IVC→EVO).
This model is here extended to an inline four-cylinder engine
by properly phasing the combustion events based on the
ﬁring order of the engine and by approximating the pressure
during the charge exchange phase of the cycle to a constant
term. As a result, the pressures pcyl,1,..., pcyl,4 of the four

The apparent net heat release rate Qn in Equation (1)
accounts for the fuel energy released during the combustion
and the heat losses due to heat transfer to the cylinder walls
[13]. This term is estimated through the deﬁnition of an
apparent fuel burning rate, which is modeled as a linear
combinations of Wiebe functions calibrated on steady-state
experimental data [14].
The cylinder pressure is used to calculate the instantaneous
indicated torque Tind,i (θi), acting on the crank arm [5], [12],
[15]. In addition to the indicated torque, the the reciprocating
inertia torque Tm,i (θi,ω) and the engine friction torque
Tfr (ω) must be modeled in order to determine the effective
torque acting on the crank arm [13]. The above terms have
been calculated as in [15].
Finally, a simple, one-degree of freedom model of the the
rotational dynamics of the crankshaft system is deﬁned by a
torque balance, assuming the crankshaft as a rigid body:

Tind,i (θi)+Tm,i (θi,ω)
Jeqω

−Tfr (ω)+Tload
Jeqω
(2)
where Jeq is the equivalent inertia of the engine cranktrain.
In order to facilitate the design of the estimator, a simpliﬁ-
cation is introduced in the model. Speciﬁcally, it is assumed
from here on that each torque pulse produced by a ﬁring
event causes a distinct ﬂuctuations in crankshaft velocity
and acceleration [16]–[18]. This allows one to decouple each
cylinder pressure event which generates a torque contribution
in Equation 2.
The complete engine cylinder pressure and crankshaft
dynamics model given by Equations (1)-(2) can be converted
to state-space form to facilitate the estimator design. To
this end, the model is slightly approximated by assuming
the reciprocating inertia torque as acting with the engine
load as an external torque, and its value calculated from
the estimated engine speed. Such approximation is accepted
for a light-duty Diesel engine, where the indicated torque is
an order of magnitude higher than the reciprocating inertia
torque [15]. Furthermore, let:
• A11(ω) = −kω1 −kω2ω

In the above form, the model can be tested for observability,
which is a necessary condition for the estimator design. To
study the uniform observability of the system, the matrix

must be of full rank for each angular position. The system
described by Equation 3 results uniformly observable except
at top dead center (TDC) and bottom dead center (BDC),
where the condition A12 = 0 occurs [5]. This is physically
reasonable, as the cylinder pressure has no effects on the
crankshaft speed when the piston is located at its extreme
positions.
III. DESIGN OF MULTI-CYLINDER PRESSURE
ESTIMATOR
The cylinder pressure estimator for a multi-cylinder engine
is implemented using a sliding mode observer (SMO), based
on the plant model in Equation (3), and assuming the only
measured variable is the engine instantaneous crankshaft
speed. The choice of the sliding mode observer is motivated
by the inherent robustness properties as well as the ability
to deal with model uncertainties.
The state estimator is characterized by the following
dynamics:
d ˆy
dθ = A11 ˆy+A12 ˆx2 +H(θ,ω)+V
(6a)
d ˆx2
dθ =
*0
A21 ˆy+A22 ˆx2 +N(θ)+LV
(6b)
where Amn are the elements of matrix A in Equation 3, V =
K sign(˜y), ˜x2 = x2 −ˆx2, and the sliding surface s = ˜y = y−ˆy.
992
The error model is given by:
d ˜y
dθ = A11 ˜y+A12 ˜x2 −K sign(˜y)
(7a)
d ˜x2
dθ = A22 ˜x2 −LK sign(˜y)
(7b)
The sliding mode gain K should be assigned so that the
sliding mode will be enforced (i.e. s˙s < 0). Therefore, K
must be sufﬁciently large so that the sign of the right-hand
side of Equation 7a is determined by the sign of the term
(−K sign(˜y)).
To mitigate the control chattering associated to the sliding
mode observer, the SMO gain can be designed as a function
of the crank angle K(θ) so that it can satisfy the sign
condition but with a small margin, as shown in Figure 1 [7].
Furthermore, a boundary layer is used for the sign function
in a small neighborhood around the sliding surface (s = 0) to
mitigate the chattering and smoothen the output by avoiding
the discontinuity. The limits of the boundary layer must be
chosen carefully so that the convergence rate of the error
stays in a desirable range.

With the sliding mode enforced, the following can be
obtained from the equivalent control principle:
⇒˜y = 0
⇒˙˜y = 0
⇒Veq = A12 ˜x2
(8a)
⇒d ˜x2
dθ = A22 ˜x2 −LA12 ˜x2 = (A22 −LA12)˜x2
(8b)
where Veq is the equivalent control, which can be interpreted
as the average of the control signal.
Finally, L(θ) is chosen such that (A22 −LA12) < 0, which
will make ˜x2 converge asymptotically to zero. Figure 2 shows
that, with an appropriate choice of L(θ), the difference A22−
L(θ)A12 is always negative. Therefore, ˆx2 should converge
to x2 = pcyl.
IV. DESIGN OF AUGMENTED PRESSURE ESTIMATOR
As designed, the SMO estimator predicts the cylinder
pressure during the closed valve portion of the engine
cycle. This design allows for predicting the engine IMEP
and indicated torque, or for combustion diagnostics such
as misﬁre detection [8]–[10], [12]. However, in order to
obtain information on the in-cylinder charge composition,
or detect imbalances in multi-cylinder engines, knowledge

of the pressure trace during the charge exchange portion of
the cycle is required.
To overcome the issue of poor accuracy during the phases
where two cylinder pressure traces overlap, the estimator is
augmented by introducing an additional state that represents
the torque produced by the prior cylinder in the sequence.
To this end, deﬁne:
• G = −k1 −k2ω
Jω
• g(θi) = rAp f(θi)

where i = 1,...,4 represents the ﬁring cylinder.
The above assumptions render the model into the follow-
ing state variable format:

y = Cx =

x = x1 = ω
(10)
Applying the SMO design, the state estimation is charac-
terized by the following dynamics:
d ˆx1
dθ = Gˆx1 +g(θi−1)ˆx2 +g(θi)ˆx3 +H(θi)+V
(11a)
d ˆx2
dθ = M(θi−1)ˆx2 +N(θi−1)+L1V
(11b)
d ˆx3
dθ = M(θi)ˆx3 +N(θi)+L2V
(11c)
where V = K sign(˜y), and the sliding surface s = ˜y = y−ˆy.
993
The error model is given by:
d ˜x1
dθ = G˜x1 +g(θi−1)˜x2 +g(θi)˜x3 −K sign(˜y)
(12a)
d ˜x2
dθ = M(θi−1)˜x2 −L1K sign(˜y)
(12b)
d ˜x3
dθ = M(θi)˜x3 −L2K sign(˜y)
(12c)
As shown above, the parameter K must be sufﬁciently
large so that the sign condition is satisﬁed. Similarly, the
chattering will be mitigated using the time varying gain and
boundary layer techniques in a small range enough to avoid
the convergence of error becoming sluggish.
With the sliding mode enforced, the following conclusions
can be drawn using the equivalent control principle:
˜y = 0
⇒˙˜y = 0
⇒Veq = g(θi−1)˜x2 +g(θi)˜x3
(13)
Substituting the equivalence control into the error equa-
tion, the following state variable error model is obtained:
⎡
⎣
d ˜x2

⎦=

where L1(θ) and L2(θ) are chosen such that the error system
matrix is negative deﬁnite.
V. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The designed pressure estimator was validated on ex-
perimental data, obtained on a light-duty Diesel engine,
whose main data are listed in Table I. Several steady-state
engine operating conditions were acquired by varying the
engine speed and torque. The crankshaft angular velocity was
recorded with an optical transducer mounted on the engine
harmonic dampener. The pressure trace of each individual
cylinder was acquired for 70 consecutive engine cycles with
a piezoelectric transducer. The signal was then low-pass
ﬁltered and pegged using the intake manifold pressure in
order to obtain the ﬁnal pressure measurement.

cycle with the experimental values, for the operating con-
dition corresponding to the input engine speed in Figure
3. As expected, the estimator follows the pressure traces
well during the closed-valve portion of the cycle, with
the exception of a few points near top dead center. This
behavior was explained by the singularity of the observability
Grammian at this condition. The deviation in the estimated
pressure trace could be mitigated by increasing the resolution
of the speed signal.
Furthermore, a deviation of the estimate from the experi-
mental data is evident when two pressure traces overlap. This
follows from the assumption of considering only one cylinder
pressure producing torque at each window, which causes the
estimator to assume the positive torque from the previous
cylinder as an equivalent pressure drop in the current acting
cylinder, resulting in an estimation error.

A set of indicative combustion metrics, namely the 50%
burn rate location (CA50), the peak pressure (Pmax) and
the IMEP, were calculated from the estimated pressure
and compared to the experimental values. Figure 5 shows
the value of the errors on the combustion metrics for 70
consecutive engine cycles using the data from cylinder 1.
The SMO accurately estimates CA50 and Pmax. On the other
hand, a bias of 3% can be observed in the estimated IMEP,
as a consequence of the drop in the estimated pressure
during the intake and compression strokes, which makes the
estimated IMEP slightly higher than the actual value. The
results for the remaining cylinders are very similar, showing
that the estimator is effective in capturing the differences in
the pressure traces among the four cylinders.

Figure 6 shows the results of the augmented estimator
in predicting the cylinder pressure traces during one engine
cycle. Compared to Figure 4, an improved performance of
the estimator in tracking the actual experimental pressure
can now be observed. In particular, the deviation in the
pressure estimation during the during the intake and early
compression strokes is here completely eliminated by the
introduction of the additional state to the model.
The improved accuracy can also be noticed in the combus-
tion metrics. As shown in Figure 7, the augmented estimator
leads to a considerably improved prediction of the engine
IMEP. Furthermore, a slight improvement in the prediction
of the cylinder peak pressure can also be observed, as a
consequence of a better prediction of the cylinder pressure
trace during the early portion of the compression stroke.

on the engine crankshaft speed sensor measurement. The
objective is to characterize the cylinder to cylinder pressure
imbalances that result from the distribution of air and EGR
to the engine cylinders, with applications to cylinder-by-
cylinder closed-loop combustion control.
A sliding mode observer was initially designed based on
a simple model characterizing the instantaneous indicated
torque and crankshaft dynamics of a multi-cylinder Diesel
engine during the closed-valve portion of the engine cycle. To
improve the estimator accuracy when two cylinder pressure
traces overlap, the sliding mode observer was augmented
995
with an additional state that represents the effects of the
preceding cylinder. This allowed the estimator to provide the
pressure traces of the engine during an entire cycle.
The estimator was validated against experimental data.
The results, in terms of cylinder pressure traces reconstruc-
tion and calculated combustion metrics, show that the design
is sufﬁciently accurate and robust to disturbances in the
measured signals. In particular, the augmented estimator was
able to remove the effect of the overlap to obtain an accurate
pressure trace, which leads to an improved estimation of the
pressure and IMEP during the entire engine cycle.
