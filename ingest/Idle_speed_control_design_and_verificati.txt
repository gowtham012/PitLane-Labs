The

for
an
in

engine
is
among
the
most
c

in

on
a
v

y
of

Ho
w
ev
er,
a
fully
satisfactory
solution
has
still
to
emerge.
In
this
pap
er,
w
e
use
a
h
ybrid
mo
del
to
describ
e
the
cyclic
b
eha
vior
of
the
engine,
th
us
capturing
the
eect
of
eac
h
spark
ignition
on
the
generated
torque
and
the
in
teraction
b
et
w
een
the
discrete
torque
generation
and
the
con
tin
uous
p
o
w
er-train
and
air
dynamics.
W
e
consider
a
traditional
spark
ignition
engine
without
Gas
Direct
Injection
(GDI).
The
torque
generated
b
y
eac
h
cylinder
and
applied
to
the
engine
crankshaft
can
b
e
assumed
to
b
e
a
function
of
the
spark
ignition
time,
and
of
the
air-fuel
mixture
mass
loaded
in
the
cylinder
during
the
in
tak
e
phase.
Since
the
air-to-fuel
ratio
is
assumed
to
b
e
constan
t
(at
the
stoic
hiometric
v
alue),
then
the
mixture
mass
is
con
trolled
b
y
the
throttle
plate
p
osition
and
is
sub
ject
to
the
dynamics
of
the
cylinder
lling.
Hence,
the
a
v
ailable
con-
trols
for
the
idle
problem
are:
the
spark
ignition
time
and
the
p
osition
of
the
throttle
v
alv
e,
whic
h
regulates
the
air
ino
w
1
.
A
h
ybrid
mo
del
of
the
plan
t
is
obtained
from
the
general
mo
del
of
an

Despite

obtained
in

The
ap-
proac
h
w
e
prop
ose
in
this
pap
er
is
to
select
semi-
heuristically
an
easy{to{implemen
t
con
troller
and
then
v
erify
that
it
satises
the
sp
ecications.
V
erifying
the
system
b
y
sim
ulation
and
protot
yp-
ing
is
certainly
p
ossible
but
w
e
cannot
guaran
tee
that
the
system
will
satisfy
the
sp
ecications
in
all
op
erating
conditions.
In
fact,
it
is
often
the
case
that
idle
con
trol
needs
extensiv
e
empirical
adjustmen
ts
in
the
car.
In
this
pap
er,
w
e
presen
t
a
rst
cut
for
a
metho
d-
ology
based
on
a
divide
and
conquer
approac
h
to
obtain
the
con
troller
and
formal
tec
hniques
to
guaran
tee
that
the
con
troller
is
con
tained
in
the
maximal
con
troller
and,
hence,
it
satises
the
sp
ecications.
In
our
case,
the
closed{lo
op
system
is
view
ed
as
comp
osed
of
three
sub-systems
(in
tak
e
manifold,
cylinders
and
p
o
w
er{train
sub-systems).
The
con-
trol
la
w
is
deriv
ed
b
y
simplifying
substan
tially
eac
h
of
the
sub-systems
so
that
the
h
ybrid
nature
of
the
mo
del
is
ignored
and
the
sub-systems
are
linearized
and
discretized
with
a
xed
sampling
time.
The
con
trol
la
w
is
syn
thesized
so
that
the
constrain
ts
are
satised
in
this
simplied
domain.
Then,
this
con
trol
la
w
is
applied
to
the
full-edged
system.
Of
course,
at
this
p
oin
t,
there
is
no
guar-
ante
e
that
the
con
trol
la
w
will
yield
a
closed{lo
op
system
that
satises
the
constrain
ts
ev
en
though
the
decomp

and
the
corresp
onding
simpli-
cations
ha
v
e
b
een
made
so
that
w
e
do
not

from
the
original
mo
del.
F

a

solution
to
this
problem.
Che

Carnegie

Univ
ersit
y
(see
Ch
utinan
and
Krogh
(1998,
2000))
has
b
een
tried,
but
the
complexit
y
of
the
mo
del
of
the
p
o
w
er
train
is
to
o
high
for
the
to
ol
to
complete
the
analysis
in
reasonable
time.
The
basic
idea
of
our
metho
dology
is
to
v
erify
eac
h
sub-system
in
isolation
assuming
that
the
b
eha
vior
of
the
other
sub-systems
satises
an
appropriate
set
of
condi-
tions.
Then,
the
consistency
of
the
assumptions
on
the
b
eha
viors
is
v
eried,
kno
wing
that
eac
h
of
the
sub-systems
w
orks
correctly
in
isolation.
The
sub-systems
are
the
same
as
the
ones
iden
tied
for
the
deriv
ation
of
the
con
trol
la
w.
Ho
w
ev
er,
the
b
eha
vior
of
the
closed-lo
op
p
o
w
er-train
sub-
system
is
still
to
o
complex
to
v
erify
formally
,
since
it
con
tains
the
h
ybrid
p
o
w
er{train
mo
del.
Hence,
the
h
ybrid
p
o
w
er{train
mo
del
is
decomp
osed
itself
in
the
con
tin
uous
part
and
the
discrete
part
and
v
eried
follo
wing
the
same
divide
and
conquer
approac
h.
Note
that
this
approac
h
is
a
particular
case
of
the
assume{guaran
tee
paradigm
widely
used
in
formal
v
erication.
While
our
metho
dol-
ogy
has
b
een
fully
dened,
w
e
still
ha
v
e
some
diÆ-
culties
with
the
application
of
the
formal
v

tion
to
ols
ev

the
decomp

T
o
summarize,
our
metho
dology
consists
of
divid-
ing
the
o
v
erall
system
in
a
set
of
in

sub-systems,

Due

our

is
to
decomp

to
devise
an
appropriate

for
eac

of

in

assuming
that
the
v
ariables
that
connect
the
sub-system
to
the
others
satisfy
an
appropriate
assumption.
The
in
terconnect
v
ariables
are
sub
ject
to
con

and
the
assumption
is
c
hosen
so
that
the
con

can
indeed
mak
e
them
true
when
applied
to
the
appropriate
sub-system.
Ev
en
with
this
divide
and
conquer
approac
h,
the
con

problem
for
eac
h
of
the
sub-system
is
highly
complicated.
Hence,
w
e
decided
to
eliminate

the

so
that

for

pro

that
the

of
the

b
elongs
to
a

In
other
w
ords,
w
e
need
to

that
a

of

is
a

for

applying

This
result
guaran
tees
that,
if

is

inside

then
the

and
the

Note
that
the
set
is
not
a
maximal
in
v

t
set,
but
a
subset.
In
Balluc

et

(2000a),
the

at

w
as
com-
puted
analytically
for
a

ybrid
mo
del,
where
the
nonlinear

w
ere
lin-
earized
and
no

w
ere
considered.
The
main
ob
jectiv

there
w
as
to
establish
the
b
est
p

ac
hiev
able
b
y
a
giv
en

without
adding
an
y
detail
and/or
constrain

on
the

con

The
appro
ximated
linear

w
ere
used
to
mak
e
the
analytical
com-
putation
feasible.
In
that
case,
the

of

for
whic
h
at

an

w

In

on
the

sp

actuator
dela
ys
and
dynamics
in
the
h

of
the
engine.
Hence,
the
v

task
is
more
complex
and
cannot
b
e
carried
out
analytically
.
W
e
need
to
sho

the

Due
to
the
added
details
on

c
haracteristics
and
due
to
the
c
hoice
of
a
particular
con

this
set
of
initial

will
b

necessarily
con

in
the
maximal

for

The

is
carried
out
using

Ho

the

Hence,
w

decided
to
apply
an

to

the

of

The

CONCLUSIONS
The
idle
sp
eed
con
trol
problem
has
b
een
formal-
ized
as
a
safet
y
sp
ecication
for
a
h
ybrid
mo
del
of
the
engine
and
the
p
o
w
er-train.
The
h
ybrid
mo
del
describ
es
the
in
tak
e
manifold
and
cylinder
lling
dynamics,
the
torque
generation
pro
cess
and
the
p
o
w
er{train,
as
w
ell
as
throttle
and
spark
ignition
actuators.
An
idle

eed

troller
has
b
een
designed
exploiting
the
decomp
osition
of
the
system
in
three
comp

the

the

the

that

w

apply
formal

to

that
the

es
indeed
meet
the

Since
formal
v

is
a
v
ery
complex
task,
w
e
applied
an
assume{guaran
tee
approac
h
that
views

as

for

The
