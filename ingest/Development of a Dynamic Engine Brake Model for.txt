Abstract — This paper presents the extension of an existing mean value 
dynamic engine model with new models for the combination of a compression 
release brake and an exhaust valve brake. The focus is on the prediction of 
engine brake torque, exhaust gas temperatures and mass flow rates. The 
implemented models are tuned on the basis of steady-state engine data. Transient 
simulation results, i.e. for the activation of the engine brake, show good 
agreement with measurements. The developed model has been used to analyze 
the possibility to use the engine brake to facilitate automatic gear switching. This 
has been verified by measurements on an actual vehicle and resulted in much 
smoother and faster gear shift.   
INTRODUCTION 
Engine brakes serve as a necessary alternative to wheel 
brakes for vehicle speed reduction. By applying the engine 
brake wheel brakes are relieved. This reduces wheel brake 
maintenance frequency and costs, helps to prevent brake 
overheating and allows for a faster reduction in engine 
speed. The faster reduction in engine speed may also be 
used to facilitate automatic gear switching.  
Traditionally, engine braking is performed by closing a 
throttle (in the form of a butterfly valve) in the exhaust 
system. Compression release brakes, in which the exhaust 
valve is opened at the end of the compression stroke, are 
more and more applied, [1][2],[3]. During compression 
release braking, the fuel injection is stopped and the engine 
functions as an air pump. By opening the exhaust valve at 
the end of the compression stroke the work performed by 
the piston during the compression stroke is not (partially) 
regained during the expansion stroke. The resulting 
negative work causes the engine speed to decrease. This 
technology is closely related to variable valve train 
operation, which is of great interest in engine development.  
During 
engine 
braking, 
manifold 
conditions 
(temperatures and pressures) and mass flow rates differ 
significantly from the conditions during normal engine 
operation. These conditions greatly influence the efficiency 
of the engine aftertreatment system. Therefore, for engine 
controller development, not only an accurate simulation of 
the engine brake torque and engine speed, is required, but 
also the prediction of exhaust temperatures and mass flow 
rates.  
Dynamic 
engine 
models 
used 
for 
powertrain 
simulations that include an engine brake are most 
frequently crankangle based models, see e.g. [4] and [5].  
The justification for this is that the relevant time scales of 
the relevant processes for switching from normal engine 
operation to braking operation are small and in the order of 
a single cylinder event. However, the higher accuracy 
obtained by applying a greater temporal resolution comes 
at the cost of an increase in computational effort. 
Therefore, in order for a model to be useable in real-time 
applications, as are typical for control algorithm validation 
(e.g. as part of a Hardware-In-the-Loop environments), the 
temporal resolution has to be decreased to limit the

computation time.  Here, mean value engine models, such 
as TNO’s DYNAmic engine MOdel DYNAMO [6], are a 
valuable 
tool. 
DYNAMO 
is 
implemented 
in 
a 
Matlab/Simulink environment and relies heavily on engine 
measurement data. It is a tool for concept studies and 
(model-based) controller development rather than a tool for 
fundamental analysis.  
Without significant modeling efforts, DYNAMO is 
already capable of simulating engine brake torque with 
good accuracy. However, for the simulation of mass flow 
rates and exhaust temperatures additional modeling is 
necessary. Accurate modeling of the engine dynamics 
during engine braking  is of great importance for controller 
development in the area of exhaust gas aftertreatment 
systems and, as a first application of the model used in this 
study, automatic gear switching.   
In this paper, the extension of TNO’s existing dynamic 
engine model with new models for the combination of 
compression release brake and exhaust valve brake, is 
presented. The focus will be on the improvement of mass 
flow rate prediction, which is closely related to the 
simulation of turbine behavior, and exhaust temperatures.  
First, the implementation of the new engine brake models 
will be presented. The brake models are tuned on the basis 
of steady-state engine data. The tuning process is not 
described in detail. Only the final results will be shown as a 
model validation. The complete engine model is then 
validated on the basis of both steady state and transient, i.e. 
for the activation of the engine brake, engine data. Finally, 
an example of model application will be presented: the 
developed model is used to examine the influence of 
engine braking on automatic gear switching. Measurements 
on an actual vehicle are performed and are shown for 
verification.    
1 IMPLEMENTATION OF BRAKE MODELS 
The engine brake models are implemented in a 
DYNAMO model of a 12.9 liter 6 cylinder DAF MX diesel 
engine. The used approach and technology can, however, 
also be applied to conventional diesel engines provided 
they have variable valve train equipment.  In figure 1 the 
architecture of the considered engine is depicted.  
The exhaust valve brake is positioned just downstream 
of the turbine.  The exhaust valve brake is explicitly added 
to the current model as an additional sub-model. Since 
DYNAMO is a mean value model, the resolution in time is 
larger than one engine cycle, i.e. in-cylinder phenomena are 
not explicitly modeled. As a result, the motion of the 
exhaust valve (gas exchange) is not described. The 
compression release brake can therefore be modeled 
implicitly only, i.e. by capturing its influence on the 
important engine variables. Table 1 shows an overview of 
the adaptations made to the existing mean value model with 
the required quantities that need to be determined.

1.1 Exhaust valve brake component model 
As mentioned, the exhaust valve brake is added as a 
new component to the mean value model. This component 
consists of a volume and a restriction with a variable flow 
area. An exhaust valve brake is a device that essentially 
creates a major restriction to the compressible flow in the 
exhaust system, thus causing a substantial exhaust 
backpressure. This backpressure remains in the cylinder for 
the entire exhaust stroke (exhaust valve open) and performs 
negative work on the piston. The result is a negative torque 
that slows down the engine.  
If the exhaust throttle is in the open position, the part of 
the exhaust system containing the exhaust valve brake is

duct,  p is the pressure, T is the temperature and R is the 
specific gas constant. The pressure is taken equal to the 
mean pressure over the restriction.  
To model the resistance to the flow as performed by the 
closed exhaust throttle (butterfly valve with a small 
orifice), the mass flow rate through the exhaust valve brake 
is described by the compressible valve flow equation:

Pressures and temperatures in (2) are total pressures and 
temperatures. However, the dynamic part of these 
quantities can be neglected. Index 1 and 2  refer to 
respectively the upstream and downstream conditions. The 
discharge coefficient 
d
C   has to be tuned to measurement 
data.  An instantaneous switch is made between equation 
(1) and (2) when the exhaust valve brake is activated. 
Equation (1) and (2) require the pressure upstream of 
the butterfly valve to be known. However, in current 
DYNAMO, the output of the turbine model is a mass flow 
rate. In order to be able to connect the butter-fly resistance 
model to the turbine model, a volume element, i.e. the duct 
between the two components, has to be added. In this 
volume, pressure is calculated using the ideal gas law:

where V  is the volume.  
Since the exhaust valve brake is positioned very close 
to the turbine outlet, the heat loss to the surroundings in the 
connecting duct is neglected. The temperature in the 
volume is assumed to be identical to the temperature of the 
incoming exhaust gas, i.e. turbine out temperature. 
1.2   Adaptation of diesel nucleus model 
The diesel nucleus component in DYNAMO calculates 
the engine torque generation, the engine mass flow rates to 
and from the engine and the temperature of the exhaust gas 
entering the exhaust manifold. Both the exhaust valve 
brake and the compression release brake (always used  in 
combination with the exhaust valve brake) have great 
influence on these variables.  First, the engine torque is 
considered followed by the engine mass flow rate and the 
temperature difference across the engine, i.e. the exhaust 
gas temperature.

frictional losses and

 is the engine speed. Because 
the fuel injection process is stopped during engine braking, 
the indicated power is zero. The frictional power is mainly 
a function of engine speed. It is assumed that the frictional 
power during braking is the same as for normal engine 
operation. The computation of the frictional power is 
therefore not altered. The exhaust valve brake interacts 
with the torque generation through the pumping work. The 
increase in backpressure results in an increase in the 
pumping work. The pumping work during normal engine 
operation is modeled as:

changed to model the pumping power during engine 
braking. However, the increased backpressure during 
braking, i.e. negative pressure difference across the engine, 
required the operating range to be extended to larger 
negative pressure differences across the engine.   
In addition to the increased pumping losses by the 
increased backpressure, resulting from the activation of the 
exhaust valve brake, the compression release brake further 
increases the braking power (i.e. larger negative engine 
torque). The pumping losses are assumed to be unaffected 
by the application of the compression release brake. The 
influence of the compression release brake on the engine 
torque is captured by adding a new power term
CRB
P
. By 
opening the exhaust valve at the end of the compression 
stroke, the engine performs compression work which is not 
(partially) regained during the subsequent expansion 
stroke. The performed compression work is mainly 
dependent on the amount of mass inside the cylinder at the 
start of compression. This in-cylinder mass is determined 
by the gas-exchange process, which is greatly affected by 
the pressure difference across the engine. The compression 
release brake power is therefore made a function of the 
pressure difference across the engine:

implemented as a one dimensional table in DYNAMO 
using the pressure difference across the engine as an input. 
The table is filled on the basis of steady-state engine 
measurements. It has to be noted here that the timing of the 
compression release brake is held fixed. The influence of 
compression release brake timing on engine behaviour was 
no subject in current study. 
1.2.2 
Engine aspirated mass flow rate – 
volumetric efficiency 
In the original model, the aspirated mass flow by the 
engine 
aspirated

 is taken proportional to the volumetric 
efficiency

 and a theoretical mass flow rate

mɺ
 
based on intake manifold conditions. The pressure 
difference across the engine is decisive for the gas 
exchange process and thus for the degree of filling of the 
cylinders with fresh charge. Pressure oscillations in the 
manifolds (i.e. manifold tuning), which are dependent on 
engine speed, also influence the volumetric efficiency. 
Therefore, in general, the volumetric efficiency is 
implemented as a map with the pressure difference across 
the engine and engine speed as input. The used model is 
given by:

For Heavy Duty applications,  engine speed  effects  on 
volumetric efficiency are limited. Therefore, only the 
pressure difference across the engine is used as an input.  
To capture the influence of engine braking on the 
volumetric efficiency, only the operating range of the used 
map has to be extended to larger negative pressure 
differences. No significant differences are found between 
the volumetric efficiencies for the exhaust valve brake and 
the combination of the exhaust valve brake and the 
compression release brake. Therefore, one operating map is 
used for both engine brake configurations.   
1.2.3 
Exhaust gas temperature 
 
In current DYNAMO, the temperature of the gas 
leaving the engine is computed as the sum of the intake 
manifold temperature and a certain temperature rise over 
the engine. For a given fuel, this temperature rise is 
dependent on the mass of fuel injected, engine speed and 
charge composition. The latter is modeled through an 
adjusted air-fuel ratio λ  in which the amount of exhaust 
gas residual in the charge is incorporated. Furthermore, a 
correction for the start of injection is implemented. During 
engine braking, the fuel injection is instantaneously 
stopped. Extrapolation of the current model to the limits 
0

 and λ →∞ gives inaccurate results. 
Therefore, as a first attempt, the temperature rise across the 
engine 
is 
directly 
taken 
from 
measurements 
and 
implemented in a table as function of engine speed.  
The engine condition can change stepwise from firing 
condition to engine braking, but the engine temperature 
will change more smoothly. Some dynamics has therefore 
been added to the engine out temperature model to capture 
these dynamics. When switching to “engine braking” the 
engine out temperature changes with a first order response 
from the current temperature to the steady-state “engine 
braking” temperature

The time constant τ  of this first order filter has to be 
fitted to transient test results. 
1.3    Adaptation of turbine model 
As mentioned before, the existing DYNAMO engine 
model is not capable of accurately simulating the mass flow 
rates during engine braking. This is mainly caused by the 
fact that the behavior of the turbo is not correctly captured. 
Analysis of preliminary simulation results learned that the 
pressure ratio over the turbine (
in
out
p
p
) is very low 
when using the exhaust brake. Consequently, the turbo 
speed is very low (10000 – 40000 RPM) too. These two 
factors cause the turbine to operate far outside the 
operating range described in the turbine manufacturer’s 
map. The operating range described by the compressor 
operating map is somewhat larger. For the steady-state 
measurements used in this study, the operating range lies 
just inside the map. However, it is possible that during 
transient operation, the compressor operates outside of the 
operating range for which data is available. At present, no 
corrections are made for this. 
The fact that the turbine operates outside of the turbine 
map, is the main reason for the deviations between 
measured and simulated mass flow rates during engine 
braking. The turbine efficiency derived from the maps is 
not correct which results in a severe under-prediction of 
turbospeeds. This finally results in too low mass flow rates 
delivered by the compressor and inaccurate simulation of 
the manifold conditions. 
For a good verification of engine behavior during 
exhaust brake operation, compressor and turbine maps 
should be made available for very low turbo speeds and 
pressure ratios. However, this data was not available in this 
project. As a pragmatic alternative to obtaining compressor 
and turbine maps for wider operating ranges, a model 
transition is proposed here. If the turbo speed drops below 
42,000 RPM and the pressure ratio over the turbine drops 
below 1.2, the turbine model changes into a simple 
compressible flow resistance. The mass flow rate through 
this restriction is again given by (1). The compressor model 
has not been changed for aforementioned reasons.   
The effective flow area

  in the 
compressible valve flow equation, see (1), describing the 
mass flow rate through the turbine, is tuned on the basis of 
steady state measurements for the combination of the 
exhaust valve brake and compression release brake. This 
effective flow area is held constant for all operating 
conditions. Figure 2 gives a comparison between the 
resulting simulated mass flow rates and the measured mass 
flow rate for different engine speeds. An acceptable 
accuracy is present (max. deviation <5% with respect to 
measured value).  Data presented in the figures is 
normalized on the basis of the maximum value from the 
corresponding measurements.

Apart from the turbine mass flow rate, the turbospeed 
and temperature drop over the turbine must also be 
described. The turbospeed is required in the compressor 
model to compute the compressor mass flow rate. The 
turbine out temperature is of great importance for the 
exhaust aftertreatment system. Both variables are fitted 
directly 
on 
steady-state 
measurement 
data. 
The 
determination of the turbospeed, which is proportional to 
the mass flow rate through the turbine, is based on the 
engine speed.  The turbine out temperature is computed as 
a function of the exhaust manifold temperature. 
2 SIMULATION RESULTS 
The implemented engine brake models are tuned on the 
basis of steady-state measurement data. In this section, first 
steady-state simulation results for the complete engine 
model will be compared with measurements for model 
validation. Here, results will be shown for both the exhaust 
valve brake and the combination of exhaust valve brake 
and compression release brake. Thereafter, the dynamics of 
the model will be validated through a comparison between 
transient simulation results and measurements, i.e. for the 
activation of the engine brake. Transient measurement data 
was only available for the configuration of the compression 
release brake (CRB) in combination with the exhaust valve 
brake (ExhB). The important variables to be considered 
here are the engine brake torque, which is of great 
importance for the engine braking efficiency, the aspirated 
mass flow rates and exhaust gas temperatures which are of 
great significance for the exhaust gas aftertreatment system.

2.1  Simulation results steady-state operation 
The steady-state results shown in this section are 
obtained by using the full engine model in DYNAMO. The 
only predefined model inputs are the engine speed, fuel 
mass flow rate (zero during engine braking) and ambient 
conditions.  These inputs are taken from the engine 
measurements.  
Figures 3 to 5 show a comparison between 
measurements and simulations for respectively the engine 
torque, aspirated air mass flow rate and exhaust manifold 
temperature. In the figures, the results for both the 
configuration of the exhaust valve brake (EhxB) and the 
combination of the exhaust valve brake and the 
compression release brake (CRB) are shown.

The figures show a good agreement between 
measurements and simulations for steady-state engine 
braking over a large range of engine speeds. The deviations 
between measured and simulated mass flow rate and engine 
torque are within 5% of the simulated values. For engine 
torque and aspirated air mass flow rate, these results 
confirm that they are mainly dependent upon the pressure 
difference across the engine as is assumed in the engine 
brake models. 
 
 
2.2. Simulation results for transient 
operation – activation of engine brake 
In order to validate the dynamic behavior of the model, 
transient measurements have been performed on the 
engine. During these tests, the engine is operating normally 
at a predefined steady-state operating point before the 
engine brake, i.e. the combination of the exhaust valve 
brake and compression release brake is activated. In these 
experiments, first the fuel flow is stopped. After one 
second, both the compression release brake and the exhaust 
valve brake are activated. For the exhaust valve brake it is 
assumed that the closing of the exhaust valve requires 0.3 
seconds. The compression release brake is activated 
instantaneously. The engine speed in the final steady state 
is also predefined.  In table 2 an overview of the initial and 
final steady states of four of the performed transient tests, 
326 
 
 
for which the results will be shown, is presented. In 
practice, transients A and D can be seen as activating the 
engine brake to maintain a constant velocity when going 
down a hill. Transients B and C can be considered as 
activating the engine brake to decrease vehicle speed, for 
example when stopping for a traffic light.

The actuation signals to the fuel injection system, 
exhaust valve brake, compression release brake and the 
engine speed are used as input variables in the DYNAMO 
simulations. It has to be noted here, that the actuator 
signals to the compression release brake and exhaust valve 
brake are not actually measured but have been numerically 
constructed. The input signal to the exhaust valve brake 
directly describes the opening percentage of the exhaust 
throttle.  Figure 6 shows the used inputs for transient A. 
As can be seen in figure 6, the engine speed drops as 
soon as the fuel flow is stopped. However, the 
dynamometer connected to the crankshaft has a set-point of 
2100 rpm. During the time period between the stopping of 
the fuel flow and the activation of the engine brake, the 
engine is driven by the dynamometer and the engine speed 
starts to increase. The activation of the engine brake results 
in a rapid decrease in engine speed before the 
dynamometer comes into play and speeds-up the engine to 
the desired final steady-state engine speed of 2100 rpm.

temperature and turbo speed. It has to be noted here, that 
the deviation present in the initial state for transients A and 
B are caused by inaccuracies in the original DYNAMO 
engine model and are not the result of the implemented 
engine brake models. The origin of the deviations in the 
initial conditions is an incorrect simulation of the exhaust 
manifold temperature, i.e. the temperature rise across the 
engine. In all figures the instantaneous events of stopping 
the fuel flow rate and activating the engine brake can be 
clearly seen as discontinuities in both the measurements 
and simulation results. As can be concluded from these 
figures, the predicted dynamic behavior is in good 
agreement with the measurements. The largest deviations 
are present in the turbo speed and exhaust manifold 
temperatures. The turbo speeds drops too slowly after the 
fuel flow has stopped. This is most probably the result of a 
defined turbo inertia which is too high in the original 
model.  This also causes the mass flow rates to remain too 
high during the time period between stopping of the fuel 
flow and activation of the engine brake. However, after the 
activation of the engine brake, the turbo speeds and mass 
flow rates are in good agreement with the measurements.  
This is an important conclusion for controller development 
for, amongst others, automatic gear switching algorithm 
development. If the engine brake is deactivated, the turbo 
speed is a decisive factor in the engine response.  The good 
agreement in mass flow rates and also in engine torque

The turbine-out temperatures in figure 9 show the 
largest deviations between simulations and measurements 
when the exhaust valve brake is activated. This is only 
partially caused by the large response time of the used 
thermocouples in the exhaust system.  The final steady 
states (not shown) show an acceptable accuracy with 
deviations < ~5% of the measured value. The used models 
for the determination of the exhaust manifold temperature 
and turbine-out temperature therefore need to be extended 
with a more physically based model to capture all of the 
influences and give a better approximation of the dynamic 
behavior.

3 MODEL APPLICATION 
The good agreement between measured and simulated 
mass flow rates and the reasonable agreement in exhaust 
gas temperature make the developed model a valuable tool 
for exhaust gas aftertreatment controller development.  The 
accurate simulation of the engine torque during the 
activation of the engine brake is beneficial for power train 
controller development. This has also been one of the first 
application of the developed engine model.  More 
specifically, the model has been used to examine the 
possibility of using the exhaust valve brake to facilitate 
automatic gear switching.  
The dynamic model has been used as a tool to verify 
that by activating the exhaust valve brake during gear 
switching the gear switching process can occur faster. The 
activation of the exhaust valve brake results in a more rapid 
decrease in engine speed. With the aid of the model a 
control algorithm (of the open loop type, i.e. feedforward) 
has been developed for this, which has subsequently been 
tested on an actual vehicle, i.e. complete power train.

Comparison between automatic gear switching 
measurements with and without the use of the exhaust 
valve brake.  
 
Figure 11 shows the measurements for both the 
situation with and without the application of the exhaust 
valve brake for up-shifting from 3rd to 9th gear. At every 
gear switch the exhaust valve brake is activated, which can 
be seen in the bottom graph which shows the pressure in 
the exhaust valve brake actuator and the exhaust manifold 
pressure. Both pressures increase during braking. The 
accelerator pedal remains at 100% (full load) during the 
whole shifting sequence. During activation of the exhaust 
valve, the engine torque and engine speed rapidly decrease. 
As can be observed from the figure, the decrease in engine 
speed is much faster when the exhaust valve brake is used. 
This will result in a much smoother and faster gear shift.  
4 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 
In this study, the implementation of engine brake 
models in an existing engine simulation tool, DYNAMO, is 
described. Although the implementation only requires 
minor adjustments to the current engine model through 
mostly empirical correlations, the model gives satisfactory 
results for both steady-state and transient (i.e. activation of 
engine brake) engine behavior during engine braking. The 
implemented 
models 
are 
based 
on 
steady-state 
measurement data. During braking the engine operates 
outside of the operating range for normal engine operation, 
e.g. higher backpressures. As a consequence, additional 
engine measurements need to be performed. However, no 
quantities are required that are not already measured in 
case of normal engine operation. The required data is 
therefore relatively easy to obtain.  
The predicted mass flow rates are greatly dependent on 
the turbo model (i.e. compressor and turbine). During 
engine braking, the turbine operates outside of its normal 
operating range for which data is available through the 
turbine manufacturers operating map.  A very pragmatic 
model for simulating the mass flow rate, turbine-out 
temperature and turbo speed is currently implemented as a 
first attempt. Results however show that already 
satisfactory agreement on mass flow rates and turbo speed 
are present with the use of these models. Only for the 
turbine-out temperature an extension of the current model, 
i.e. a more physically based model, is requested. 
Deviations present are not only coupled to the turbine 
model, but mainly to the prediction of the exhaust gas 
temperature exiting the engine.   
The benefits of the model are that it is relatively simple, 
computationally very efficient (real-time) and it able to 
calculate quantities during engine braking which are of 
great significance for exhaust gas aftertreatment system 
control, i.e. engine mass exhaust gas flow rate and 
temperature.  This is of great importance since in the future 
exhaust gas aftertreatment system controls will become 
more and more integrated in the engine control system. The 
accurate prediction of dynamic engine behavior during 
engine braking makes the model a valuable tool for 
controller development. In the present study, the model has 
been used to examine the possibility to apply the exhaust 
valve brake during automatic gear switching. With the aid 
of the model it was verified that the exhaust valve brake 
can facilitate the gear switching by decreasing the engine

speed more rapidly.  This has subsequently been checked 
on an actual vehicle.  
The present engine simulation tool, DYNAMO, is a 
mean value model. This means that in-cylinder phenomena 
are not explicitly modeled. The temporal resolution is 
greater than one engine cycle. Compression release braking 
and, most importantly, combustion and emission formation, 
are occurring on a much smaller time scale. Therefore, 
current research focuses on extending DYNAMO with a 
real-time in-cylinder model for combustion and emission 
formation 
evaluation. 
This 
will 
also 
include 
the 
incorporation of more advanced combustion concepts, such 
as 
Homogeneous 
Charge 
Compression 
Ignition 
Combustion.
