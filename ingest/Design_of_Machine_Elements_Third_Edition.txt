Preface
It was really a pleasure to receive an overwhelming response to the textbook Design of Machine Elements 
since it was published ﬁ rst in 1994. In fact, whenever I visit an engineering college in any part of the country, 
students and staff members of the Mechanical Engineering Department know me as  the ‘Machine Design 
author’ and the book has become my identity.
Machine design occupies a prominent position in the curriculum of Mechanical Engineering. It consists of 
applications of scientiﬁ c principles, technical information and innovative ideas for the development of a new 
or improved machine. The task of a machine designer has never been easy, since he has to consider a number 
of factors, which are not always compatible with the present-day technology. In the context of today’s techni-
cal and social climate, the designer’s task has become increasingly difﬁ cult. Today’s designer is required to 
account for many factors and considerations that are almost impossible for one individual to be thoroughly 
conversant with. At the same time, he cannot afford to play a role of something like that of a music director. 
He must have a special competence of his own and a reasonable knowledge of other ‘instruments.’
New to this Edition
After the publication of the second edition in 2007, it was observed that there was a need to incorporate a 
broader coverage of topics in the textbook to suit the content of ‘Machine Design’ syllabi of various uni-
versities in our country. One complete chapter on ‘Design of Engine Components’ (Chapter 25) and half 
a chapter on ‘Design of Riveted Joints’ (Chapter 8) are added to fulﬁ ll this requirement. Design of Engine 
Components includes cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts and valve-gear mechanism. Design of 
Riveted Joints includes strength equations, eccentrically loaded joints and riveted joints in boiler shells. 
Another important feature of the current edition is changing the style of solutions to numerical examples. 
A ‘step-by-step’ approach is incorporated in all solved examples of the book. This will further simplify and 
clarify the understanding of the examples.
Target Audience
This book is intended to serve as a textbook for all the courses in Machine Design. It covers the syllabi of all 
universities, technical boards and professional examining bodies such as Institute of Engineers in the country. 
It is also useful for the preparation of competitive examinations like UPSC and GATE. 
This textbook is particularly written for the students of the Indian subcontinent, who ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to 
adopt the textbooks written by foreign authors.

design. Chapter 3 explains in detail the manufacturing considerations in design. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss 
the various procedures for design against static load and ﬂ uctuating load correspondingly.
Chapter 6 describes power screws in detail while chapters 7 and 8 specify the features and varieties of 
threaded joints, and welded and riveted joints in that order. Similarly, chapters 9 to 22 are each devoted to 
a particular design element, that is, shafts, keys and couplings; springs; friction clutches; brakes; belt drives; 
chain drives; rolling contact bearings; sliding contact bearings; spur gears; helical gears; bevel gears; worm 
gears; ﬂ ywheel; cylinders and pressure vessels respectively.

Introduction
Chapter 1
1.1 MACHINE DESIGN
Machine design is deﬁ ned as the use of scientiﬁ c 
principles, technical information and imagination 
in the description of a machine or a mechanical 
system to perform speciﬁ c functions with maximum 
economy and efﬁ ciency. This deﬁ nition of machine 
design contains the following important features: 
 
(i) A designer uses principles of basic and 
engineering sciences such as physics, 
mathematics, 
statics 
and 
dynamics, 
thermodynamics and heat transfer, vibrations 
and ﬂ uid mechanics. Some of the examples 
of these principles are
 
(a) Newton’s laws of motion,
 
(b) D’ Alembert’s principle,
 
(c) Boyle’s and Charles’ laws of gases,
 
(d) Carnot cycle, and
 
(e) Bernoulli’s principle.
 (ii) The designer has technical information of 
the basic elements of a machine. These 
elements include fastening devices, chain, 
 1 Henry Dreyfuss–The Proﬁ le of Industrial Designer—Machine Design, July 22, 1967.
belt and gear drives, bearings, oil seals and 
gaskets, springs, shafts, keys, couplings, 
and so on. A machine is a combination of 
these basic elements. The designer knows 
the relative advantages and disadvantages of 
these basic elements and their suitability in 
different applications.
 (iii) The designer uses his skill and imagination 
to produce a conﬁ guration, which is a 
combination 
of 
these 
basic 
elements. 
However, 
this 
combination 
is 
unique 
and different in different situations. The 
intellectual part of constructing a proper 
conﬁ guration is creative in nature.
 (iv) The ﬁ nal outcome of the design process 
consists of the description of the machine. 
The description is in the form of drawings of 
assembly and individual components.
 (v) A design is created to satisfy a recognised 
need of customer. The need may be to 
perform a speciﬁ c function with maximum 
economy and efﬁ ciency.
If the point of contact between the product and people becomes a point of friction, then 
the industrial designer has failed. On the other hand, if people are made safer, more 
efﬁ cient, more comfortable—or just plain happier—by contact with the product, then the 
designer has succeeded.
Henry Dreyfuss1
2 Design of Machine Elements
Machine design is the creation of plans for 
a machine to perform the desired functions. 
The machine may be entirely new in concept, 
performing a new type of work, or it may more 
economically perform the work that can be done 
by an existing machine. It may be an improvement 
or enlargement of an existing machine for better 
economy and capability.
1.2 BASIC PROCEDURE OF MACHINE  
 
DESIGN
The basic procedure of machine design consists of 
a step-by-step approach from given speciﬁ cations 
about the functional requirements of a product to 
the complete description in the form of drawings 
of the ﬁ nal product. A logical sequence of steps, 
usually common to all design projects, is illustrated 
in Fig. 1.1. These steps are interrelated and 
interdependent, each reﬂ ecting and affecting all 
Fig. 1.1 The Design Process
other steps. The following steps are involved in the 
process of machine design.
Step 1: Product Speciﬁ cations
The ﬁ rst step consists of preparing a complete list of 
the requirements of the product. The requirements 
include the output capacity of the machine, and its 
service life, cost and reliability. In some cases, the 
overall dimensions and weight of the product are 
speciﬁ ed. For example, while designing a scooter, 
the list of speciﬁ cations will be as follows: 
 
(i) Fuel consumption = 40 km/l
 (ii) Maximum speed = 85 km/hr
 (iii) Carrying capacity = two persons with 10 kg  
 
luggage
 (iv) Overall dimensions
 
 Width = 700 mm
 
 Length = 1750 mm
 
 Height = 1000 mm
 (v) Weight = 95 kg 
 (vi) Cost =  Rs 40000 to Rs 45000 
In consumer products, external appearance, 
noiseless performance and simplicity in operation 
of controls are important requirements. Depending 
upon the type of product, various requirements are 
given weightages and a priority list of speciﬁ cations 
is prepared.
Step 2: Selection of Mechanism
After careful study of the requirements, the 
designer prepares rough sketches of different 
possible mechanisms for the product. For example, 
while designing a blanking or piercing press, the 
following mechanisms are possible:
 
(i) a mechanism involving the crank and 
connecting rod, converting the rotary motion 
of the electric motor into the reciprocating 
motion of the punch; 
 (ii) a mechanism involving nut and screw, which 
is a simple and cheap conﬁ guration but 
having poor efﬁ ciency; and
 (iii) a mechanism consisting of a hydraulic 
cylinder, piston and valves which is a costly 
conﬁ guration but highly efﬁ cient.
The alternative mechanisms are compared 
with each other and also with the mechanism 
of the products that are available in the market. 
An approximate estimation of the cost of each 
alternative conﬁ guration is made and compared 
with the cost of existing products. This will reveal 
the competitiveness of the product. While selecting 
the ﬁ nal conﬁ guration, the designer should 
Introduction 3
consider whether the raw materials and standard 
parts required for making the product are available 
in the market. He should also consider whether 
the manufacturing processes required to fabricate 
the non-standard components are available in the 
factory. Depending upon the cost-competitiveness, 
availability of raw materials and manufacturing 
facility, the best possible mechanism is selected for 
the product.
Step 3: Layout of Conﬁ guration
The next step in a design procedure is to prepare 
a block diagram showing the general layout of the 
selected conﬁ guration. For example, the layout of 
an Electrically-operated Overhead Travelling (EOT) 
crane will consist of the following components:
 
(i) electric motor for power supply;
 (ii) ﬂ exible coupling to connect the motor shaft 
to the clutch shaft;
 (iii) clutch to connect or disconnect the electric 
motor at the will of the operator;
 (iv) gear box to reduce the speed from 1440 rpm 
to about 15 rpm;
 (v) rope drum to convert the rotary motion of the 
shaft to the linear motion of the wire rope;
 (vi) wire rope and pulley with the crane hook to 
attach the load; and
 (vii) brake to stop the motion.
In this step, the designer speciﬁ es the joining 
methods, such as riveting, bolting or welding to 
connect the individual components. Rough sketches 
of shapes of the individual parts are prepared.
Step 4: Design of Individual Components
The design of individual components or machine 
elements is an important step in a design process. It 
consists of the following stages:
 
(i) Determine 
the 
forces 
acting 
on 
the 
component.
 (ii) Select proper material for the component 
depending upon the functional requirements 
such as strength, rigidity, hardness and wear 
resistance.
 (iii) Determine the likely mode of failure for the 
component and depending upon it, select the 
criterion of failure, such as yield strength, 
ultimate tensile strength, endurance limit or 
permissible deﬂ ection.
  (iv) Determine the geometric dimensions of the 
component using a suitable factor of safety 
and modify the dimensions from assembly 
and manufacturing considerations.
This stage involves detailed stress and deﬂ ection 
analysis. The subjects ‘Machine Design’ or 
‘Elements of Machine Design’ cover mainly 
the design of machine elements or individual 
components of the machine. Section 1.4 on Design 
of Machine Elements, elaborates the details of this 
important step in design procedure.
Step 5: Preparation of Drawings
The last stage in a design process is to prepare 
drawings of the assembly and the individual 
components. On these drawings, the material of 
the component, its dimensions, tolerances, surface 
ﬁ nish grades and machining symbols are speciﬁ ed. 
The designer prepares two separate lists of 
components—standard components to be purchased 
directly from the market and special components 
to be machined in the factory. In many cases, a 
prototype model is prepared for the product and 
thoroughly tested before ﬁ nalising the assembly 
drawings. 
It is seen that the process of machine design 
involves 
systematic 
approach 
from 
known 
speciﬁ cations 
to 
unknown 
solutions. 
Quite 
often, problems arise on the shop ﬂ oor during 
the production stage and design may require 
modiﬁ cations. In such circumstances, the designer 
has to consult the manufacturing engineer and ﬁ nd 
out the suitable modiﬁ cation.
1.3 BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF
 
MACHINE ELEMENTS
A machine consists of machine elements. Each part 
of a machine, which has motion with respect to some 
other part, is called a machine element. It is important 
to note that each machine element may consist of 
several parts, which are manufactured separately. 
For example, a rolling contact bearing is a machine 
element and it consists of an inner race, outer race, 
4 Design of Machine Elements
cage and rolling elements like balls. Machine elements 
can be classiﬁ ed into two groups—general-purpose 
and special-purpose machine elements. General-
purpose machine elements include shafts, couplings, 
clutches, bearings, springs, gears and machine frames 
Special-purpose machine elements include pistons, 
valves or spindles. Special-purpose machine elements 
are used only in certain types of applications. On the 
contrary, general-purpose machine elements are used 
in a large number of machines.
The broad objective of designing a machine 
element is to ensure that it preserves its operating 
capacity during the stipulated service life with 
minimum manufacturing and operating costs. 
In order to achieve this objective, the machine 
element should satisfy the following basic 
requirements:
(i) Strength: A machine part should not fail under 
the effect of the forces that act on it. It should have 
sufﬁ cient strength to avoid failure either due to 
fracture or due to general yielding.
(ii) Rigidity: A machine component should be rigid, 
that is, it should not deﬂ ect or bend too much due 
to forces or moments that act on it. A transmission 
shaft in many times designed on the basis of lateral 
and torsional rigidities. In these cases, maximum 
permissible deﬂ ection and permissible angle of 
twist are the criteria for design. 
(iii) Wear Resistance: Wear is the main reason for 
putting the machine part out of order. It reduces 
useful life of the component. Wear also leads to 
the loss of accuracy of machine tools. There are 
different types of wear such as abrasive wear, 
corrosive wear and pitting. Surface hardening 
can increase the wear resistance of the machine 
components, such as gears and cams.
(iv) Minimum Dimensions and Weight: A machine 
part should be sufﬁ ciently strong, rigid and wear-
resistant and at the same time, with minimum 
possible dimensions and weight. This will result in 
minimum material cost. 
(v) Manufacturability: Manufacturability is the 
ease of fabrication and assembly. The shape and 
material of the machine part should be selected in 
such a way that it can be produced with minimum 
labour cost.
(vi) Safety: The shape and dimensions of the 
machine parts should ensure safety to the operator 
of the machine. The designer should assume the 
worst possible conditions and apply ‘fail-safe’ or 
‘redundancy’ principles in such cases.
(vii) Conformance to Standards: A machine part 
should conform to the national or international 
standard covering its proﬁ le, dimensions, grade and 
material.
(viii) Reliability: Reliability is the probability that 
a machine part will perform its intended functions 
under desired operating conditions over a speciﬁ ed 
period of time. A machine part should be reliable, 
that is, it should perform its function satisfactorily 
over its lifetime.
(ix) Maintainability: A machine part should be 
maintainable. Maintainability is the ease with 
which a machine part can be serviced or repaired.
(x) Minimum: Life-cycle Cost: Life-cycle cost of 
the machine part is the total cost to be paid by the 
purchaser for purchasing the part and operating and 
maintaining it over its life span.
It will be observed that the above mentioned 
requirements serve as the basis for design projects 
in many cases.
1.4 DESIGN OF MACHINE ELEMENTS
Design of machine elements is the most important 
step in the complete procedure of machine design. 
In order to ensure the basic requirements of 
machine elements, calculations are carried out to 
ﬁ nd out the dimensions of the machine elements. 
These calculations form an integral part of the 
design of machine elements. The basic procedure 
of the design of machine elements is illustrated in 
Fig. 1.2. It consists of the following steps:
Introduction 5
Fig. 1.2 Basic Procedure of Design of Machine
 
Element
Step 1: Speciﬁ cation of Function
The design of machine elements begins with the 
speciﬁ cation of the functions of the element. The 
functions of some machine elements are as follows: 
 
(i) Bearing To support the rotating shaft and 
conﬁ ne its motion
 (ii) Key To transmit the torque between the 
shaft and the adjoining machine part like 
gear, pulley or sprocket
 (iii) Spring in Clock To store and release the 
energy
 (iv) Spring in Spring Balance To measure the 
force
 (v) Screw Fastening To hold two or more 
machine parts together
 (vi)  Power Screw To produce uniform and 
slow motion and to transmit the force
Step 2: Determination of Forces
In many cases, a free-body diagram of forces 
is constructed to determine the forces acting on 
different parts of the machine. The external and 
internal forces that act on a machine element are as 
follows:
 
(i) The external force due to energy, power or 
torque transmitted by the machine part, often 
called ‘useful’ load
 (ii) Static force due to deadweight of the 
machine part
 (iii) Force due to frictional resistance
 (iv) Inertia force due to change in linear or 
angular velocity
 (v) Centrifugal force due to change in direction 
of velocity
 (vi) Force due to thermal gradient or variation in 
temperature
 (vii) Force set up during manufacturing the part 
resulting in residual stresses
 (viii) Force due to particular shape of the part such 
as stress concentration due to abrupt change 
in cross-section
For every machine element, all forces in this 
list may not be applicable. They vary depending 
on the application. There is one more important 
consideration. The force acting on the machine 
part is either assumed to be concentrated at some 
point in the machine part or distributed over a 
particular area. Experience is essential to make 
such assumptions in the analysis of forces.
Step 3: Selection of Material
Four basic factors, which are considered in selecting 
the material, are availability, cost, mechanical 
properties and manufacturing considerations. 
For example, ﬂ ywheel, housing of gearbox 
or engine block have complex shapes. These 
components are made of cast iron because the 
casting process produces complicated shapes without 
involving machining operations. Transmission shafts 
are made of plain carbon steels, because they are 
available in the form of rods, besides their higher 
strength. The automobile body and hood are made 
of low carbon steels because their cold formability is 
essential to press the parts. Free cutting steels have 
excellent machinability due to addition of sulphur. 
They are ideally suitable for bolts and studs because 
of the ease with which the thread proﬁ les can be 
machined. The crankshaft and connecting rod are 
subjected to ﬂ uctuating forces and nickel–chromium 
steel is used for these components due to its higher 
fatigue strength. 
6 Design of Machine Elements
Step 4: Failure Criterion
Before ﬁ nding out the dimensions of the component, 
it is necessary to know the type of failure that the 
component may fail when put into service. The 
machine component is said to have ‘failed’ when it 
is unable to perform its functions satisfactorily. The 
three basic types of failure are as follows:
 
(i) failure by elastic deﬂ ection;
 (ii) failure by general yielding; and
 (iii) failure by fracture.
In applications like transmission shaft, which 
is used to support gears, the maximum force 
acting on the shaft is limited by the permissible 
deﬂ ection. When this deﬂ ection exceeds a 
particular value (usually, 0.001 to 0.003 times of 
span length between two bearings), the meshing 
between teeth of gears is affected and the shaft 
cannot perform its function properly. In this case, 
the shaft is said to have ‘failed’ due to elastic 
deﬂ ection. Components made of ductile materials 
like steel lose their engineering usefulness due to 
large amount of plastic deformation. This type of 
failure is called failure by yielding. Components 
made of brittle materials like cast iron fail because 
of sudden fracture without any plastic deformation. 
There are two basic modes of gear-tooth failure—
breakage of tooth due to static and dynamic load 
and surface pitting. The surface of the gear tooth 
is covered with small ‘pits’ resulting in rapid wear. 
Pitting is a surface fatigue failure. The components 
of ball bearings such as rolling elements, inner and 
outer races fail due to fatigue cracks after certain 
number of revolutions. Sliding contact bearings 
fail due to corrosion and abrasive wear by foreign 
particles.
Step 5: Determination of Dimensions
 The shape of the machine element depends on two 
factors, viz., the operating conditions and the shape 
of the adjoining machine element. For example, 
involute proﬁ le is used for gear teeth because it 
satisﬁ es the fundamental law of gearing. A V-belt 
has a trapezoidal cross-section because it results 
in wedge action and increases the force of friction 
between the surfaces of the belt and the pulley. On 
the other hand, the pulley of a V-belt should have a 
shape which will match with the adjoining belt. The 
proﬁ le of the teeth of sprocket wheel should match 
the roller, bushing, inner and outer link plates of the 
roller chain. Depending on the operating conditions 
and shape of the adjoining element, the shape of 
the machine element is decided and a rough sketch 
is prepared.
 The geometric dimensions of the component 
are determined on the basis of failure criterion. In 
simple cases, the dimensions are determined on the 
basis of allowable stress or deﬂ ection. For example, 
a tension rod, illustrated in Fig. 1.3, is subjected to 
a force of 5 kN. The rod is made of plain carbon
Fig. 1.3 Tension Rod
steel and the permissible tensile stress is 80 N/mm2. 
The diameter of the rod is determined on the basis 
of allowable stress using the following expression:

Therefore,

As a second example, consider a transmission

a gear. The shaft is made of steel and the modulus

Therefore,

The following observations are made from the 
above two examples:
 
(i) Failure mode for the tension rod is general 
yielding while elastic deﬂ ection is the failure 
criterion for the transmission shaft.
 (ii) The permissible tensile stress for tension rod 
is obtained by dividing the yield strength 
by the factor of safety. Therefore, yield 
strength is the criterion of design. In case 
of a transmission shaft, lateral deﬂ ection or 
rigidity is the criterion of design. Therefore, 
modulus of elasticity is an important 
property for ﬁ nding out the dimensions of 
the shaft.
Determination of geometric dimensions is an 
important step while designing machine elements. 
Various criteria such as yield strength, ultimate 
tensile strength, torsional or lateral deﬂ ection and 
permissible bearing pressure are used to ﬁ nd out 
these dimensions.
Step 6: Design Modiﬁ cations
The geometric dimensions of the machine element 
are modiﬁ ed from assembly and manufacturing 
considerations. For example, the transmission shaft 
illustrated in Fig. 1.4 is provided with steps and 
shoulders for proper mounting of gear and bearings. 
Revised calculations are carried out for operating 
capacity, margin of safety at critical cross-sections 
and resultant stresses taking into consideration the 
effect of stress concentration. When these values 
differ from desired values, the dimensions of the 
component are modiﬁ ed. The process is continued 
till the desired values of operating capacity, factor 
of safety and stresses at critical cross-sections are 
obtained.
Step 7: Working Drawing
The last step in the design of machine elements 
is to prepare a working drawing of the machine 
element showing dimensions, tolerances, surface 
ﬁ nish grades, geometric tolerances and special 
production requirements like heat treatment. 
The working drawing must be clear, concise and 
complete. It must have enough views and cross-
sections to show all details. The main view of the 
machine element should show it in a position, it 
is required to occupy in service. Every dimension 
must be given. There should not be scope for 
guesswork and a necessity for scaling the drawing. 
All dimensions that are important for proper 
assembly and interchangeability must be provided 
with tolerances.

1.5 TRADITIONAL DESIGN METHODS
There are two traditional methods of design—
design by craft evolution and design by drawing. 
Bullock cart, rowing boat, plow and musical 
instruments are some of the products, which are 
produced by the craft-evolution process. The salient 
features of this age-old technique are as follows:
 
(i) The craftsmen do not prepare dimensioned 
drawings of their products. They cannot 
offer adequate justiﬁ cation for the designs 
they make.
 (ii) These products are developed by trial and 
error over many centuries. Any modiﬁ cation 
in the product is costly, because the 
craftsman has to experiment with the 
product itself. Moreover, only one change 
at a time can be attempted and complete 
reorganization of the product is difﬁ cult.
 (iii) The essential information of the product 
such as materials, dimensions of parts, 
manufacturing 
methods 
and 
assembly 
techniques is transmitted from place to place 
and time to time by two ways. First, the 
product, which basically remains unchanged, 
is the main source of information. The exact 
memory of the sequence of operations 
required to make the product is second 
source of information. There is no symbolic 
medium to record the design information of 
the product.
With all these weaknesses, the craft-evolution 
process has successfully developed some of the 
complex structures. The craft-evolution method has 
become obsolete due to two reasons. This method 
cannot adapt to sudden changes in requirement. 
Secondly, the product cannot be manufactured on a 
mass scale.
 The essential features of design by drawing 
method are as follows:
 
(i) The dimensions of the product are speciﬁ ed 
in advance of its manufacture.
 (ii) The complete manufacturing of the product 
can be subdivided into separate pieces, which 
can be made by different people. This division 
of work is not possible with craft-evolution.
  (iii) When the product is to be developed by 
trial and error, the process is carried out on 
a drawing board instead of shop ﬂ oor. The 
drawings of the product are modiﬁ ed and 
developed prior to manufacture.
In this method, much of the intellectual activity 
is taken away from the shop ﬂ oor and assigned to 
design engineers.
1.6 DESIGN SYNTHESIS
Design synthesis is deﬁ ned as the process of 
creating or selecting conﬁ gurations, materials, 
shapes and dimensions for a product. It is a 
decision making process with the main objective 
of optimisation. There is a basic difference 
between design analysis and design synthesis. In 
design analysis, the designer assumes a particular 
mechanism, a particular material and mode of 
failure for the component. With the help of this 
information, he determines the dimensions of 
the product. However, design synthesis does 
not permit such assumptions. Here, the designer 
selects the optimum conﬁ guration from a number 
of alternative solutions. He decides the material 
for the component from a number of alternative 
materials. He determines the optimum shape 
and dimensions of the component on the basis of 
mathematical analysis.
 In design synthesis, the designer has to ﬁ x the 
objective. The objective can be minimum cost, 
minimum weight or volume, maximum reliability 
or maximum life. The second step is mathematical 
formulation of these objectives and requirements. 
The ﬁ nal step is mathematical analysis for 
optimisation and interpretation of the results. In 
order to illustrate the process of design synthesis, 
let us consider a problem of designing cylindrical 
cans. The requirements are as follows:
 
(i) The cylindrical can is completely enclosed 
and the cost of its material should be 
minimum.
 (ii) The cans are to be stored on a shelf and the 
dimensions of the shelf are such that the 
radius of the can should not exceed Rmax.
Introduction 9
The following notations are used in the analysis:
 r = radius of can
 h = height of can
 A = surface area of can
 V = volume of can
Therefore, 
 
A = 2pr2 + 2prh 
(a)
 
V = pr2h 
(b)
Substituting Eq. (b) in Eq. (a),
 
A = 2pr2 + 2V

It is seen from the above example, that design 
synthesis begins with the statement of requirements, 
which are then converted into mathematical 
expressions and ﬁ nally, equations are solved for 
optimisation.

1.7 USE OF STANDARDS IN DESIGN
Standardization is deﬁ ned as obligatory norms, to 
which various characteristics of a product should 
conform. The characteristics include materials, 
dimensions and shape of the component, method of 
testing and method of marking, packing and storing 
of the product. The following standards are used in 
mechanical engineering design:
(i) Standards 
for 
Materials, 
their 
Chemical 
Compositions, Mechanical Properties and Heat 
Treatment For example, Indian standard IS 210 
speciﬁ es seven grades of grey cast iron designated 
as FG 150, FG 200, FG 220, FG 260, FG 300, FG 
350 and FG 400. The number indicates ultimate 
tensile strength in N/mm2. IS 1570 (Part 4) 
speciﬁ es chemical composition of various grades of 
alloy steel. For example, alloy steel designated by 
55Cr3 has 0.5–0.6% carbon, 0.10–0.35% silicon, 
0.6–0.8% manganese and 0.6–0.8% chromium.
10 Design of Machine Elements
(ii) Standards for Shapes and Dimensions of 
Commonly used Machine Elements The machine 
elements include bolts, screws and nuts, rivets, 
belts and chains, ball and roller bearings, wire 
ropes, keys and splines, etc. For example, IS 2494
(Part 1) speciﬁ es dimensions and shape of the cross-
section of endless V-belts for power transmission. 
The dimensions of the trapezoidal cross-section of 
the belt, viz. width, height and included angle are 
speciﬁ ed in this standard. The dimensions of rotary 
shaft oil seal units are given in IS 5129 (Part 1). 
These dimensions include inner and outer diameters 
and width of oil seal units. 
(iii) Standards for Fits, Tolerances and Surface 
Finish of Component For example, selection of the 
type of ﬁ t for different applications is illustrated in IS 
2709 on ‘Guide for selection of ﬁ ts’. The tolerances or 
upper and lower limits for various sizes of holes and 
shafts are speciﬁ ed in IS 919 on ‘Recommendations 
for limits and ﬁ ts for engineering’. IS 10719 explains 
method for indicating surface texture on technical 
drawings. The method of showing geometrical 
tolerances is explained in IS 8000 on ‘Geometrical 
tolerancing on technical drawings’.
(iv) Standards for Testing of Products These 
standards, 
sometimes 
called 
‘codes’, 
give 
procedures to test the products such as pressure 
vessel, boiler, crane and wire rope, where safety 
of the operator is an important consideration. For 
example, IS 807 is a code of practice for design, 
manufacture, erection and testing of cranes and 
hoists. The method of testing of pressure vessels is 
explained in IS 2825 on ‘Code for unﬁ red pressure 
vessels’. 
(v) Standards 
for 
Engineering 
Drawing 
of 
Components For example, there is a special 
publication SP46 prepared by Bureau of Indian 
Standards on ‘Engineering Drawing Practice for 
Schools and Colleges’ which covers all standards 
related to engineering drawing.
There are two words—standard and code—
which are often used in standards. A standard 
is deﬁ ned as a set of speciﬁ cations for parts, 
materials or processes. The objective of a standard 
is to reduce the variety and limit the number of 
items to a reasonable level. On the other hand, 
a code is deﬁ ned as a set of speciﬁ cations for the 
analysis, design, manufacture, testing and erection 
of the product. The purpose of a code is to achieve 
a speciﬁ ed level of safety.
There are three types of standards used in design 
ofﬁ ce. They are as follows:
(i) Company standards They are used in a particular 
company or a group of sister concerns.
(ii) National standards These are the IS (Bureau 
of Indian Standards), DIN (German), AISI or SAE 
(USA) or BS (UK) standards.
(iii) International standards These are prepared by 
the International Standards Organization (ISO).
Standardization offers the following advantages: 
 (a) The reduction in types and dimensions of 
identical components to a rational number 
makes it possible to manufacture the standard 
component on a mass scale in a centralised 
process. For example, a specialised factory 
like Associated Bearing Company (SKF) 
manufactures ball and roller bearings, which 
are required by all engineering industries. 
Manufacture of a standard component on 
mass production basis reduces the cost. 
 (b) Since the standard component is manufactured 
by a specialised factory, it relieves the 
machine-building plant of the laborious work 
of manufacturing that part. Availability of 
standard components like bearings, seals, 
knobs, wheels, roller chains, belts, hydraulic 
cylinders 
and 
valves 
has 
considerably 
reduced the manufacturing facilities required 
by the individual organisation.
 (c) Standard parts are easy to replace when 
worn out due to interchangeability. This 
facilitates servicing and maintenance of 
machines. Availability of standard spare 
parts is always assured. The work of 
servicing and maintenance can be carried 
out even at an ordinary service station. 
These factors reduce the maintenance cost 
of machines.
 (d) The 
application 
of 
standard 
machine 
elements and especially the standard units 
Introduction 11
(e.g. couplings, cocks, pumps, pressure 
reducing valves and electric motors) reduce 
the time and effort needed to design a new 
machine. It is no longer necessary to design, 
manufacture and test these elements and 
units, and all that the designer has to do is 
to select them from the manufacturer’s 
catalogues. On the other hand, enormous 
amount of work would be required to design 
a machine if all the screws, bolts, nuts, 
bearings, etc., had to be designed anew each 
time. Standardization results in substantial 
saving in the designer’s effort.
 (e) The standards of speciﬁ cations and testing 
procedures of machine elements improve 
their 
quality 
and 
reliability. 
Standard 
components like SKF bearings, Dunlop belts 
or Diamond chains have a long-standing 
reputation for their reliability in engineering 
industries. Use of standard components 
improves the quality and reliability of the 
machine to be designed.
In design, the aim is to use as many standard 
components as possible for a given machine. The 
selection of standard parts in no way restricts the 
creative initiative of the designer and does not prevent 
him from ﬁ nding better and more rational solutions.
1.8 SELECTION OF PREFERRED SIZES
In engineering design, many a times, the designer 
has to specify the size of the product. The ‘size’ 
of the product is a general term, which includes 
different parameters like power transmitting 
capacity, load carrying capacity, speed, dimensions 
of the component such as height, length and 
width, and volume or weight of the product. 
These parameters are expressed numerically, e.g., 
5 kW, 10 kN or 1000 rpm. Often, the product is 
manufactured in different sizes or models; for 
instance, a company may be manufacturing seven 
different models of electric motors ranging from 
0.5 to 50 kW to cater to the need of different 
customers. Preferred numbers are used to specify 
the ‘sizes’ of the product in these cases. 
French 
balloonist 
and 
engineer 
Charles 
Renard ﬁ rst introduced preferred numbers in the 
19th century. The system is based on the use of 
geometric progression to develop a set of numbers. 
There are ﬁ ve basic series2, denoted as R5, R10, 
R20, R40 and R80 series, which increase in steps 
of 58%, 26%, 12%, 6%, and 3%, respectively. Each 
series has its own series factor. The series factors 
are given in Table 1.1.

 R40 Series

 R80 Series

 = 1.03
The series is established by taking the ﬁ rst 
number and multiplying it by a series factor to get 
the second number. The second number is again 
multiplied by a series factor to get the third number. 
This procedure is continued until the complete 
series is built up. The resultant numbers are rounded 
and shown in Table 1.2. As an example, consider 
a manufacturer of lifting tackles who wants to 
introduce nine different models of capacities 
ranging from about 15 to 100 kN. Referring to the 
R10 series, the capacities of different models of the 
lifting tackle will be 16, 20, 25, 31.5, 40, 50, 63, 80 
and 100 kN.

It is observed from Table 1.2 that small sizes 
differ from each other by small amounts, while 
large sizes by large amounts. In the initial stages, 
the product is manufactured in a limited quantity 
and use is made of the R5 series. As the scale of 
production is increased, a change over is made 
from R5 to R10 series, introducing new sizes 
of intermediate values of R10 series. Preferred 
numbers minimise unnecessary variation in sizes. 
They assist the designer in avoiding selection of 
sizes in an arbitrary manner. The complete range 
is covered by minimum number of sizes, which is 
advantageous to the producer and consumer.
There are two terms, namely, ‘basic series’ 
and ‘derived series’, which are frequently used in 
relation to preferred numbers. R5, R10, R20, R40 
and R80 are called basic series. Any series that 
is formed on the basis of these ﬁ ve basic series 
is called derived series. In other words, derived 
series are derived from basic series. There are 
two methods of forming derived series, namely, 
reducing the numbers of a particular basic series or 
increasing the numbers.
In the ﬁ rst method, a derived series is obtained 
by taking every second, third, fourth or pth term 
of a given basic series. Such a derived series 
is designated by the symbol of the basic series 
followed by the number 2, 3, 4 or p and separated 
by ‘/’ sign. If the series is limited, the designation 
also includes the limits inside the bracket. If the 
series is unlimited, at least one of the numbers of 
that series is mentioned inside the bracket. Let us 
consider the meaning of these designations.
 
(i) Series R 10/3 (1, … ,1000) indicates a derived 
series comprising of every third term of the 
R10 series and having the lower limit as 1 
and higher limit as 1000.
 (ii) Series R 20/4 (…, 8, …) indicates a derived 
series comprising of every fourth term of 
the R20 series, unlimited in both sides and 
having the number 8 inside the series.
 (iii) Series R 20/3 (200, …) indicates a derived 
series comprising of every third term of the 
R20 series and having the lower limit as 200 
and without any higher limit.
 (iv) Series R 20/3 (…200) indicates a derived 
series comprising of every third term of the 
R20 series and having the higher limit as 
200 and without any lower limit.
In the second method, the derived series is 
obtained by increasing the numbers of a particular 
basic series. Let us consider an example of a 
derived series of numbers ranging from 1 to 
1000 based on the R5 series. From Table 1.2, the 
Table 1.2 Contd
Introduction 13
numbers belonging to the R5 series from 1 to 10 
are as follows:
1, 1.6, 2.5, 4, 6.3, 10
The next numbers are obtained by multiplying 
the above numbers by 10. They are as follows:
16, 25, 40, 63, 100
The same procedure is repeated and the next 
numbers are obtained by multiplying the above 
numbers by 10.
160, 250, 400, 630, 1000
Therefore, the complete derived series on the 
basis of R5 series is as follows:
1, 1.6, 2.5, 4, 6.3, 10, 16, 25, 40, 63, 100, 160, 
250, 400, 630, 1000
The advantage of derived series is that one can 
obtain geometric series for any range of numbers, 
that is, with any value of the ﬁ rst and the last 
numbers. Also, one can have any intermediate 
numbers between these two limits. 
Example 1.1 Find out the numbers of the R5 basic 
series from 1 to 10.

Step II Calculation of numbers
The series R5 is established by taking the ﬁ rst 
number and multiplying it by a series factor to get 
the second number. The second number is again 
multiplied by a series factor to get the third number. 
This procedure is continued until the complete 
series is built up. The numbers thus obtained are 
rounded. 
First number = 1
Second number = 1 (1.5849) = 1.5849 = (1.6)
Third number = (1.5849)(1.5849) = (1.5849)2
 
= 2.51 = (2.5)
Fourth number = (1.5849)2(1.5849) = (1.5849)3
 
= 3.98 = (4)
Fifth number = (1.5849)3(1.5849) = (1.5849)4
 
= (6.3)
Sixth number = (1.5849)4(1.5849) = (1.5849)5
 
= (10)
In above calculations, the rounded numbers are 
shown in brackets.

Third number = 100(1.5848)(1.5848) = 100(1.5848)2 
 
= 251.16 = (250)
Fourth number = 100(1.5848)2(1.5848)
 
= 100(1.5848)3 = 398.04 = (400)
Fifth number = 100(1.5848)3(1.5848)
 
= 100(1.5848)4 = 630.81= (630)
Sixth number = 100(1.5848)4(1.5848)
 
= 100(1.5848)5 = 999.71 = (1000)
In the above calculations, the rounded numbers 
are shown in brackets. The complete series is given

The diameters of shafts will be as follows:
100(f)0, 100(f)1, 100(f)2, 100(f)3, …, 100(f)10

of the R10 series given in Table 1.2 are multiplied 
by 100. The diameter series is written as follows:

1.9 AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS  
 
IN DESIGN
Each product has a deﬁ nite purpose. It has to 
perform speciﬁ c functions to the satisfaction of 
customer. The contact between the product and 
the people arises due to the sheer necessity of this 
functional requirement. The functional requirement 
of an automobile car is to carry four passengers 
at a speed of 60 km/hr. There are people in cities 
who want to go to their ofﬁ ce at a distance of 15 
km in 15 minutes. So they purchase a car. The 
speciﬁ c function of a domestic refrigerator is to 
preserve vegetables and fruits for a week. There is 
a housewife in the city who cannot go to the market 
daily and purchase fresh vegetables. Therefore, 
she purchases the refrigerator. It is seen that such 
functional requirements bring products and people 
together.
However, when there are a number of products 
in the market having the same qualities of 
efﬁ ciency, durability and cost, the customer is 
attracted towards the most appealing product. 
Introduction 15
External appearance is an important feature, 
which not only gives grace and lustre to the 
product but also dominates sale in the market. 
This is particularly true for consumer durables like 
automobiles, household appliances and audiovisual 
equipment.
The growing realisation of the need of aesthetic 
considerations in product design has given rise to 
a separate discipline known as ‘industrial design’. 
The job of an industrial designer is to create new 
forms and shapes, which are aesthetically pleasing. 
The industrial designer has, therefore, become the 
fashion maker in hardware.
Like in fashion, the outward appearance of a 
product undergoes many changes over the years. 
There are ﬁ ve basic forms—step, stream, taper, 
shear and sculpture. The step form is similar to the 
shape of a ‘skyscraper’ or multistorey building. This 
involves shapes with a vertical accent rather than a 
horizontal. The stream or streamline form is seen 
in automobiles and aeroplane structures. The taper 
form consists of tapered blocks interlocked with 
tapered plinths or cylinders. The shear form has a 
square outlook, which is suitable for free-standing 
engineering products. The sculpture form consists 
of ellipsoids, paraboloids and hyperboloids. The 
sculpture and stream forms are suitable for mobile 
products like vehicles, while step and shear forms 
are suitable for stationary products.
There is a relationship between functional 
requirement and appearance of the product. In 
many cases, functional requirements result in 
shapes which are aesthetically pleasing. The 
evolution of the streamlined shape of the Boeing is 
the result of studies in aerodynamics for effortless 
speed. The robust outlook and sound proportions 
of a high-capacity hydraulic press are the results 
of requirements like rigidity and strength. The 
objective of chromium plating of the parts of 
household appliances is corrosion resistance rather 
than pleasing appearance.
Selection of proper colour is an important 
consideration in product aesthetics. The choice of 
colour should be compatible with the conventional 
ideas of the operator. Many colours are associated 
with different moods and conditions. Morgan has 
suggested the meaning of colours that are given in 
Table 1.3.

The external appearance of the product 
does not depend upon only the two factors of 
form and colour. It is a cumulative effect of a 
number of factors such as rigidity and resilience, 
tolerances and surface ﬁ nish, motion of individual 
components, materials, manufacturing methods 
and noise. The industrial designer should select 
a form which is in harmony with the functional 
requirements of the product. The economics and 
availability of surface-treating processes like 
anodizing, plating, blackening and painting should 
be taken into account before ﬁ nalising the external 
appearance of the product.
1.10 ERGONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
 
IN DESIGN
Ergonomics is deﬁ ned as the relationship between 
man and machine and the application of anatomical, 
physiological and psychological principles to solve 
the problems arising from man–machine relationship. 
The word ‘ergonomics’ is coined from two Greek 
words—‘ergon’, which means ‘work’ and ‘nomos’, 
which means ‘natural laws’. Ergonomics means the 
natural laws of work. From design considerations, 
the topics of ergonomic studies are as follows:
 
(i) Anatomical factors in the design of a driver’s 
seat
 (ii) Layout of instrument dials and display panels 
for accurate perception by the operators
 (iii) Design of hand levers and hand wheels
 (iv) Energy expenditure in hand and foot 
operations
16 Design of Machine Elements
 (v) Lighting, noise and climatic conditions in 
machine environment
Ergonomists have carried out experiments to 
determine the best dimensions of a driver’s seat, 
the most convenient hand or foot pressure or 
dimensions of levers and hand wheels.
The machine is considered as an entity in itself 
in machine design. However, ergonomists consider 
a man–machine joint system, forming a closed loop 
as shown in Fig. 1.6. From display instruments, the 
operator gets the information about the operations 
of the machine. If he feels that a correction is 
necessary, he will operate the levers or controls. 
This, in turn, will alter the performance of the 
machine, which will be indicated on display panels. 
The contact between man and machine in this 
closed-loop system arises at two places—display 
instruments, which give information to the operator, 
and controls with which the operator adjusts the 
machine.
Fig. 1.6 Man–Machine Closed-Loop System
The visual display instruments are classiﬁ ed into 
three groups:
 
(i) Displays giving quantitative measurements, 
such as speedometer, voltmeter or energy meter
 (ii) Displays giving the state of affairs, such as 
the red lamp indicator
 (iii) Displays indicating predetermined settings, 
e.g., a lever which can be set at 1440 rpm, 
720 rpm or ‘off’ position for a two-speed 
electric motor.
Moving scale or dial-type instruments are 
used for quantitative measurements, while lever-
type indicators are used for setting purposes. The 
basic objective behind the design of displays is to 
minimise fatigue to the operator, who has to observe 
them continuously. The ergonomic considerations in 
the design of displays are as follows:
 
(i) The scale on the dial indicator should be 
divided in suitable numerical progression 
like 0 –10 –20 –30 and not 0 –5 –30 –55.
 (ii) The 
number 
of 
subdivisions 
between 
numbered divisions should be minimum.
 (iii) The size of letters or numbers on the 
indicator should be as follows: 
 Height of letter or number > Reading distance
200
 (iv) Vertical ﬁ gures should be used for stationary 
dials, while radially oriented ﬁ gures are 
suitable for rotating dials.
 (v) The pointer should have a knife-edge with a 
mirror in the dial to minimise parallax error.
The controls used to operate the machines 
consist of levers, cranks, hand wheels, knobs, 
switches, push buttons and pedals. Most of them are 
hand operated. When a large force is required to 
operate the controls, levers and hand wheels are 
used. When the operating forces are light, push 
buttons or knobs are preferred. The ergonomic 
considerations in the design of controls are as 
follows:
 (i) The controls should be easily accessible and 
logically positioned. The control operation 
should involve minimum motions and avoid 
awkward movements.
 (ii) The shape of the control component, which 
comes in contact with hands, should be in con-
formity with the anatomy of human hands.
 (iii) Proper colour produces beneﬁ cial psycholo-
gical effects. The controls should be painted 
in red colour in the grey background of 
machine tools to call for attention.
The aim of ergonomics is to reduce the 
operational difﬁ culties present in a man–machine 
joint system, and thereby reduce the resulting 
physical and mental stresses.
The shape and dimensions of certain machine 
elements like levers, cranks and hand wheels 
are decided on the basis of ergonomic studies. 
The resisting force, i.e., the force exerted by the 
operator without undue fatigue is also obtained by 
Introduction 17
ergonomic considerations. Ergonomic textbooks3,  4 
give exhaustive details of the dimensions and 
resisting forces of different control elements. In this 
article, we will restrict the consideration to levers, 
cranks and hand wheels, which are frequently 
required in machine design. The nomenclature for 
the dimensions of lever, crank and hand wheel are 
shown in Fig. 1.7. Their dimensions and magnitude 
of resisting force are given in Tables 1.4 to 1.6.

1.11 CONCURRENT ENGINEERING
Conventional design process is sequential, where 
the main activities are executed in a sequence as 
shown in Fig. 1.8. It begins with market survey, 
with the objective of ﬁ nding out the requirements 
of the customer. This information is then handed 
over to the design department in the form of a 
‘product brief ’. The design department prepares 
the design and makes a few prototype samples 
for testing. The assembly and detail drawings are 
then prepared and passed on to the production 
department for their approval. Usually, the 
18 Design of Machine Elements
production 
department 
suggests 
changes 
in 
design from manufacturing considerations and the 
drawings are sent back to the design department. 
This process of sending the drawings by the design 
department to the production department and from 
the production department back to the design 
department continues till the design is ﬁ nalised and 
in between valuable time is lost. Engineers who 
design new products and manufacturing personnel 
who have to ﬁ gure out how to make the product are 
often at odds because of their different backgrounds 
and points of view. Many times, designers are 
creative artists who overlook the capabilities of 
the plant’s machinery. Manufacturing engineers on 
the other hand, are realistic. They prefer standard 
materials, simple manufacturing methods, standard 
components and as few of them as possible. Due 
to this difference in background, many a times the 
designer comes up with a new product and throws 
it ‘over the wall’ to the manufacturing personnel, 
who says “We can’t make this”. Then there is a lot 
of ﬁ nger pointing. In the sequential design process, 
the production department suggests a number of 
design modiﬁ cations, after the design is ﬁ nalised. 
In past, this has resulted in time consuming re-
designs and missed time schedules in a number of 
projects. Personality conﬂ icts and departmental 
barriers often create more problems. Due to these 
reasons, sequential design is often called ‘over the 
wall’ design.
Fig. 1.8 Sequential Design Process
In recent years, there is a fundamental shift in 
the way the designs are prepared. The sequential 
design process is being replaced by simultaneous or 
concurrent engineering, where various activities are 
carried out in parallel, instead of in series. The trend 
is to bring the design and manufacturing activities 
together as a single engineering discipline.
Concurrent engineering is deﬁ ned as the design 
process that brings both design and manufacturing 
engineers together during the early phases of 
design process. In this process, a team of specialists 
examines the design from different angles as shown 
in Fig. 1.9. The specialists include a manufacturing 
engineer, 
tool 
engineer, 
ﬁ eld 
personnel, 
reliability engineer and safety engineer. They 
consider various aspects of the product such as 
feasibility, manufacturability, assembly, testability, 
performance, reliability, maintainability, safety 
and cost. All these aspects are simultaneously 
considered early in the design stage. For example, 
manufacturing and assembly is simultaneously 
considered with stress analysis. This results in 
smaller number of modiﬁ cations in the design at a 
later stage and reduces the ‘time interval’ from the 
conceptual stage to the marketing stage.
Fig. 1.9 Simultaneous Design Process
An example of a company making measuring 
instruments is interesting5. Keithley Instruments, 
Solon, USA applied the concept of concurrent 
engineering in development of a digital multi-
meter. The number of parts in the new instrument 
were reduced from 131 to 76, the number of 
assembly screws were reduced from 30 to 8 and 
assembly time was reduced by 35% requiring only 
one screwdriver instead of multiple assembly tools.

2.1 STRESS–STRAIN DIAGRAMS
A very useful information concerning the behaviour 
of material and its usefulness for engineering 
applications can be obtained by making a tension 
test and plotting a curve showing the variation of 
stress with respect to strain. A tension test is one 
of the simplest and basic tests and determines 
values of number of parameters concerned with 
mechanical properties of materials like strength, 
ductility and toughness. The following information 
can be obtained from a tension test: 
 
(i) Proportional limit
 (ii) Elastic limit
 (iii) Modulus of elasticity
 (iv) Yield strength
 (v) Ultimate tension strength
 (vi) Modulus of resilience
 (vii) Modulus of toughness
 (viii) Percentage elongation
 (ix) Percentage reduction in area
The specimen used in a tension test is illustrated 
in Fig. 2.1. The shape and dimensions of this 
specimen are standardised. They should conform to 
IS 1608 : 19721. The cross-section of the specimen 
can be circular, square or rectangular. The standard 
gauge length l0 is given by,

where A0 is the cross-sectional area of the 
specimen.
For circular cross-section,
 
l0 ≈ 5d0
Fig. 2.1 Specimen of Tension-test
In a tension test, the specimen is subjected to 
axial tension force, which is gradually increased 
and the corresponding deformation is measured. 
Initially, the gauge length is marked on the 
specimen and initial dimensions d0 and l0 are 
measured before starting the test. The specimen 
is then mounted on the machine and gripped in 
the jaws. It is then subjected to an axial tension 
force, which is increased by suitable increments. 
After each increment, the amount by which the 
gauge length l0 increases, i.e., deformation of 
gauge length, is measured by an extensometer. 
The procedure of measuring the tension force and 
corresponding deformation is continued till fracture

Engineering Materials 21
occurs and the specimen is broken into two pieces. 
The tensile force divided by the original cross-
sectional area of the specimen gives stress, while 
the deformation divided by gauge length gives the 
strain in the specimen. 
Therefore, the results of a tension test are 
expressed by means of stress–strain relationship 
and plotted in the form of a graph. A typical stress–
strain diagram for ductile materials like mild steel 
is shown in Fig. 2.2. The following properties of a 
material can be obtained from this diagram:
Fig. 2.2 Stress–Strain Diagram of Ductile Materials
(i) Proportional Limit It is observed from the 
diagram that stress–strain relationship is linear 
from the point O to P. OP is a straight line and 
after the point P, the curve begins to deviate from 
the straight line. Hooke’s law states that stress 
is directly proportional to strain. Therefore, it 
is applicable only up to the point P. The term 
proportional limit is deﬁ ned as the stress at which 
the stress–strain curve begins to deviate from the 
straight line. Point P indicates the proportional 
limit.
(ii) Modulus of Elasticity The modulus of 
elasticity or Young’s modulus (E) is the ratio of 
stress to strain up to the point P. It is given by the 
slope of the line OP. Therefore,

=

(iii) Elastic Limit Even if the specimen is 
stressed beyond the point P and up to the point E, 
it will regain its initial size and shape when the 
load is removed. This indicates that the material 
is in elastic stage up to the point E. Therefore, E 
is called the elastic limit. The elastic limit of the 
material is deﬁ ned as the maximum stress without 
any permanent deformation. 
 The proportional limit and elastic limit are very 
close to each other, and it is difﬁ cult to distinguish 
between points P and E on the stress–strain 
diagram. In practice, many times, these two limits 
are taken to be equal. 
(iv) Yield Strength When the specimen is stressed 
beyond the point E, plastic deformation occurs and 
the material starts yielding. During this stage, it is 
not possible to recover the initial size and shape of 
the specimen on the removal of the load. It is seen 
from the diagram that beyond the point E, the strain 
increases at a faster rate up to the point Y1. In other 
words, there is an appreciable increase in strain 
without much increase in stress. In case of mild 
steel, it is observed that there is a small reduction 
in load and the curve drops down to the point Y2 
immediately after yielding starts. The points Y1 
and Y2 are called the upper and lower yield points, 
respectively. For many materials, the points Y1 and 
Y2 are very close to each other and in such cases, 
the two points are considered as same and denoted 
by Y. The stress corresponding to the yield point 
Y is called the yield strength. The yield strength is 
deﬁ ned as the maximum stress at which a marked 
increase in elongation occurs without increase in 
the load.
 Many varieties of steel, especially heat-treated 
steels and cold-drawn steels, do not have a well-
deﬁ ned yield point on the stress–strain diagram. 
As shown in Fig. 2.3, the material yields gradually 
after passing through the elastic limit E. If the 
loading is stopped at the point Y, at a stress level 
slightly higher than the elastic limit E, and the 
specimen is unloaded and readings taken, the curve 
would follow the dotted line and a permanent 
set or plastic deformation will exist. The strain 
corresponding to this permanent deformation is 
indicated by OA. For such materials, which do 
not exhibit a well-deﬁ ned yield point, the yield 
strength is deﬁ ned as the stress corresponding to 
22 Design of Machine Elements
a permanent set of 0.2% of gauge length. In such 
cases, the yield strength is determined by the offset 
method. A distance OA equal to 0.002 mm/mm 
strain (corresponding to 0.2% of gauge length) is 
marked on the X-axis. A line is constructed from 
the point A parallel to the straight line portion OP 
of the stress–strain curve. The point of intersection 
of this line and the stress–strain curve is called Y 
or the yield point and the corresponding stress is 
called 0.2% yield strength.

Fig. 2.3 Yield Stress by Offset Method
 The terms proof load or proof strength are 
frequently used in the design of fasteners. Proof 
strength is similar to yield strength. It is determined 
by the offset method; however the offset in this case 
is 0.001 mm/mm corresponding to a permanent 
set of 0.1% of gauge length. 0.1% Proof strength, 
denoted by symbol Rp0.1, is deﬁ ned as the stress 
which will produce a permanent extension of 0.1% 
in the gauge length of the test specimen. The proof 
load is the force corresponding to proof stress.
(v) Ultimate Tensile Strength We will refer back 
to the stress–strain diagram of ductile materials 
illustrated in Fig. 2.2. After the yield point Y2, 
plastic deformation of the specimen increases. The 
material becomes stronger due to strain hardening, 
and higher and higher load is required to deform 
the material. Finally, the load and corresponding 
stress reach a maximum value, as given by the 
point U. The stress corresponding to the point U 
is called the ultimate strength. The ultimate tensile 
strength is the maximum stress that can be reached 
in the tension test.
 For ductile materials, the diameter of the 
specimen begins to decrease rapidly beyond 
the maximum load point U. There is a localised 
reduction in the cross-sectional area, called necking. 
As the test progresses, the cross-sectional area at the 
neck decreases rapidly and fracture takes place at the 
narrowest cross-section of the neck. This fracture is 
shown by the point F on the diagram. The stress at 
the time of fracture is called breaking strength. It is 
observed from the stress–strain diagram that there 
is a downward trend after the maximum stress has 
been reached. The breaking strength is slightly lower 
than the ultimate tensile strength. 
 The stress–strain diagram for brittle materials 
like cast iron is shown in Fig. 2.4. It is observed that 
such materials do not exhibit the yield point. The 
deviation of the stress–strain curve from straight line 
begins very early and fracture occurs suddenly at 
the point U with very small plastic deformation and 
without necking. Therefore, ultimate tensile strength 
is considered as failure criterion in brittle materials.

(vi) Percentage Elongation After the fracture, the 
two halves of the broken test specimen are ﬁ tted 
together as shown in Fig. 2.5(b) and the extended 
gauge length l is measured. The percentage elongation 
is deﬁ ned as the ratio of the increase in the length of the 
gauge section of the specimen to original gauge length, 
expressed in per cent. Therefore,

A0 = original cross-sectional area of the test  
 
specimen
A = ﬁ nal cross-sectional area after fracture
Percentage reduction in area, like percentage 
elongation, is a measure of the ductility of the 
material. If porosity or inclusions are present in 
the material or if damage due to overheating of the 
material has occurred, the percentage elongation as 
well as percentage reduction in area are drastically 
decreased. Therefore, percentage elongation or 
percentage reduction in area is considered as an 
index of quality for the material.
2.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
ENGINEERING MATERIALS
Materials are characterised by their properties. 
They may be hard, ductile or heavy. Conversely, 
they may be soft, brittle or light. The mechanical 
properties of materials are the properties that 
describe the behaviour of the material under the 
action of external forces. They usually relate 
to elastic and plastic behaviour of the material. 
Mechanical properties are of signiﬁ cant importance 
in the selection of material for structural machine 
components. In this article, we will consider the 
following mechanical properties:
 (1) strength
 (2) elasticity
 (3) plasticity
 (4) stiffness 
 (5) resilience
 (6) toughness
 (7) malleability
 (8) ductility
 (9) brittleness
 (10) hardness
Strength is deﬁ ned as the ability of the material 
to resist, without rupture, external forces causing 
various types of stresses. Strength is measured 
by different quantities. Depending upon the type 
of stresses induced by external loads, strength is 
expressed as tensile strength, compressive strength 
or shear strength. Tensile strength is the ability of 
the material to resist external load causing tensile 
stress, without fracture. Compressive strength 
is the ability to resist external load that causes 
compressive stress, without failure. The terms yield 
strength and ultimate tensile strength are explained 
in the previous article. 
Elasticity is deﬁ ned as the ability of the material 
to regain its original shape and size after the 
deformation, when the external forces are removed. 
All engineering metals are elastic but the degree 
of elasticity varies. Steel is perfectly elastic within 
a certain elastic limit. The amount of elastic 
deformation which a metal can undergo is very 
small. During the elastic deformation, the atoms of 
the metal are displaced from their original positions 
but not to the extent that they take up new positions. 
Therefore, when the external force is removed, the 
atoms of the metal return to their original positions 
and the metal takes back its original shape. 
Plasticity is deﬁ ned as the ability of the material 
to retain the deformation produced under the load 
on a permanent basis. In this case, the external 
forces deform the metal to such an extent that 
it cannot fully recover its original dimensions. 
During plastic deformation, atoms of the metal 
are permanently displaced from their original 
positions and take up new positions. The ability 
24 Design of Machine Elements
of some metals to be extensively deformed in the 
plastic range without fracture is one of the useful 
engineering properties of materials. For example, 
the extensive plastic deformability of low carbon 
steels enables automobile parts such as the body, 
hood and doors to be stamped out without fracture. 
The difference between elasticity and plasticity is 
as follows:
 
(i) Elasticity is the ability of a metal to regain its 
original shape after temporary deformation 
under an external force. Plasticity is the 
ability to retain the deformation permanently 
even after the load is removed.
 (ii) The amount of elastic deformation is very 
small while plastic deformation is relatively 
more.
 (iii) During elastic deformation, atoms of metal 
are temporarily displaced from their original 
positions but return back when the load is 
removed. During plastic deformation, atoms 
of metal are permanently displaced from 
their original positions and take up new 
positions.
 (iv) For majority of materials, the stress–strain 
relationship is linear in the elastic range and 
non-linear in the plastic range.
 (v) Elasticity is an important consideration in 
machine-tool components while plasticity 
is desirable for components made by press 
working operations.
Stiffness or rigidity is deﬁ ned as the ability of 
the material to resist deformation under the action 
of an external load. All materials deform when 
stressed, to a more or less extent. For a given stress 
within elastic limit, the material that deforms least 
is the stiffest. Modulus of elasticity is the measure 
of stiffness. The values of the modulus of elasticity 
for aluminium alloy and carbon steel are 71 000 
and 207 000 N/mm2 respectively. Therefore, carbon 
steel is stiffer than aluminium alloy. Stiffness 
is an important consideration in the design of 
transmission shafting.
Resilience is deﬁ ned as the ability of the 
material to absorb energy when deformed 
elastically and to release this energy when 
unloaded. A resilient material absorbs energy 
within elastic range without any permanent 
deformation. This property is essential for spring 
materials. Resilience is measured by a quantity, 
called modulus of resilience, which is the strain 
energy per unit volume that is required to stress the 
specimen in a tension test to the elastic limit point. 
It is represented by the area under the stress–strain 
curve from the origin to the elastic limit point.
Toughness is deﬁ ned as the ability of the 
material to absorb energy before fracture takes 
place. In other words, toughness is the energy 
for failure by fracture. This property is essential 
for machine components which are required to 
withstand impact loads. Tough materials have the 
ability to bend, twist or stretch before failure takes 
place. All structural steels are tough materials. 
Toughness is measured by a quantity called 
modulus of toughness. Modulus of toughness is the 
total area under stress–strain curve in a tension test, 
which also represents the work done to fracture 
the specimen. In practice, toughness is measured 
by the Izod and Charpy impact testing machines. 
Toughness decreases as the temperature increases. 
The difference between resilience and toughness is 
as follows:
 
(i) Resilience is the ability of the material 
to absorb energy within elastic range. 
Toughness is the ability to absorb energy 
within elastic and plastic range.
 (ii) Modulus of resilience is the area below the 
stress–strain curve in a tension test up to 
the yield point. Modulus of toughness is the 
total area below the stress–strain curve.
 (iii) Resilience is essential in spring applications 
while toughness is required for components 
subjected to bending, twisting, stretching or 
to impact loads. Spring steels are resilient 
while structural steels are tough.
Figures 2.6(a) and (b) show the difference 
between modulii of resilience and toughness.
Engineering Materials 25
Fig. 2.6 Modulii of Resilience and Toughness
Malleability is deﬁ ned as the ability of a 
material to deform to a greater extent before the 
sign of crack, when it is subjected to compressive 
force. The term ‘malleability’ comes from a word 
meaning ‘hammer’, and in a narrow sense, it means 
the ability to be hammered out into thin sections. 
Malleable metals can be rolled, forged or extruded 
because these processes involve shaping under 
compressive force. Low carbon steels, copper 
and aluminium are malleable metals. In general, 
malleability increases with temperature. Therefore, 
processes like forging or rolling are hot working 
processes where hot ingots or slabs are given a 
shape.
Ductility is deﬁ ned as the ability of a material to 
deform to a greater extent before the sign of crack, 
when it is subjected to tensile force. In other words, 
ductility is the permanent strain that accompanies 
fracture in a tension test. Ductile materials are those 
materials which deform plastically to a greater 
extent prior to fracture in a tension test. Mild steel, 
copper and aluminium are ductile materials. Ductile 
metals can be formed, drawn or bent because these 
processes involve shaping under tension. Ductility 
is a desirable property in machine components 
which are subjected to unanticipated overloads 
or impact loads. Ductility is measured in units of 
percentage elongation or percentage reduction 
in area in a tension test. The ductility of metal 
decreases as the temperature increases because 
metals become weak at increasing temperature. 
All ductile materials are also malleable; however, 
the converse is not always true. Some metals are 
soft but weak in tension and, therefore, tend to tear 
apart under tension. Both malleability as well as 
ductility are reduced by the presence of impurities 
in the metal. The difference between malleability 
and ductility is as follows:
 
(i) Malleability is the ability of a material to 
deform under compressive force. Ductility is 
the ability to deform under tensile force. 
 (ii) Malleability increases with temperature, 
while ductility decreases with increasing 
temperature.
 (iii) All ductile materials are also malleable, but 
the converse is not true. 
 (iv) Malleability is an important property when 
the component is forged, rolled or extruded. 
Ductility is desirable when the component is 
formed or drawn. It is also desirable when 
the machine component is subjected to shock 
loads.
Brittleness is the property of a material which 
shows negligible plastic deformation before fracture 
takes place. Brittleness is the opposite to ductility. 
A brittle material is that which undergoes little 
plastic deformation prior to fracture in a tension 
test. Cast iron is an example of brittle material. In 
ductile materials, failure takes place by yielding. 
Brittle components fail by sudden fracture. A 
tensile strain of 5% at fracture in a tension test is 
considered as the dividing line between ductile and 
brittle materials. The difference between ductility 
and brittleness is as follows:
 
(i) Ductile materials deform to a greater 
extent before fracture in a tension test. 
Brittle materials show negligible plastic 
deformation prior to fracture.
26 Design of Machine Elements
 (ii) Steels, copper and aluminium are ductile 
materials, while cast iron is brittle. 
 (iii) The energy absorbed by a ductile specimen 
before fracture in a tension test is more, 
while brittle fracture is accompanied by 
negligible energy absorption.
 (iv) In ductile materials, failure takes place by 
yielding which is gradual. Brittle materials 
fail by sudden fracture.
Hardness is deﬁ ned as the resistance of the 
material to penetration or permanent deformation. 
It 
usually 
indicates 
resistance 
to 
abrasion, 
scratching, cutting or shaping. Hardness is an 
important property in the selection of material for 
parts which rub on one another such as pinion and 
gear, cam and follower, rail and wheel and parts 
of ball bearing. Wear resistance of these parts 
is improved by increasing surface hardness by 
case hardening. There are four primary methods 
of measuring hardness—Brinell hardness test, 
Rockwell hardness test, Vicker hardness test and 
Shore scleroscope. In the ﬁ rst three methods, 
an indenter is pressed onto the surface under a 
speciﬁ c force. The shape of the indenter is either 
a ball, pyramid or cone. The indenters are made 
of diamond, carbide or hardened steel, which are 
much more harder than the surface being tested. 
Depending upon the cross-sectional area and depth 
of indentation, hardness is expressed in the form of 
an empirical number like Brinell hardness number. 
In a Shore scleroscope, the height of rebound from 
the surface being tested indicates the hardness. 
Hardness test is simpler than tension test. It is non-
destructive because a small indentation may not be 
detrimental to the performance of the product.
Hardness of the material depends upon the 
resistance to plastic deformation. Therefore, as the 
hardness increases, the strength also increases. For 
certain metals like steels, empirical relationships 
between strength and hardness are established. For 
steels,
Sut = 3.45 (BHN)
where Sut is ultimate tensile strength in N/mm2.
2.3 
CAST IRON
Cast iron is a generic term, which refers to a family 
of materials that differ widely in their mechanical 
properties. By deﬁ nition, cast iron is an alloy of 
iron and carbon, containing more than 2% of 
carbon. In addition to carbon, cast iron contains 
other elements like silicon, manganese, sulphur and 
phosphorus. There is a basic difference between 
steels and cast iron. Steels usually contain less than 
1% carbon while cast iron normally contains 2 to 
4% carbon. Typical composition of ordinary cast 
iron is as follows: 
carbon 
= 3.0 – 4.0%
silicon 
= 1.0 – 3.0%
manganese = 0.5 – 1.0%
sulphur 
= up to 0.1%
phosphorus = up to 0.1%
iron 
= remainder
The 
mechanical 
properties 
of 
cast 
iron 
components are inferior to the parts, which are 
machined from rolled steels. However, even with 
this drawback, cast iron offers the only choice under 
certain conditions. From design considerations, cast 
iron offers the following advantages:
 
(i) It is available in large quantities and is 
produced on a mass scale. The tooling 
required for the casting process is relatively 
simple and inexpensive. This reduces the 
cost of cast iron products.
 (ii) Cast iron components can be given any 
complex shape without involving costly 
machining operations.
 (iii) Cast iron has a higher compressive strength. 
The compressive strength of cast iron is 
three to ﬁ ve times that of steel. This is an 
advantage in certain applications.
 (iv) Cast iron has an excellent ability to damp 
vibrations, which makes it an ideal choice 
for machine tool guides and frames.
 (v) Cast iron has more resistance to wear 
even under the conditions of boundary 
lubrication.
Engineering Materials 27
 (vi) The mechanical properties of cast iron parts 
do not change between room temperature 
and 350°C.
 (vii) Cast iron parts have low notch sensitivity.
Cast iron has certain drawbacks. It has a poor 
tensile strength compared to steel. Cast iron parts 
are section-sensitive. Even with the same chemical 
composition, the tensile strength of a cast iron part 
decreases as the thickness of the section increases. 
This is due to the low cooling rate of thick sections. 
For thin sections, the cooling rate is high, resulting 
in increased hardness and strength. Cast iron does 
not offer any plastic deformation before failure 
and exhibits no yield point. The failure of cast 
iron parts is sudden and total. Cast iron parts 
are, therefore, not suitable for applications where 
permanent deformation is preferred over fracture. 
Cast iron is brittle and has poor impact resistance. 
The machinability of cast iron parts is poor 
compared to the parts made of steel.
Cast irons are classiﬁ ed on the basis of 
distribution of carbon content in their micro-
structure. There are three popular types of cast 
iron—grey, malleable and ductile. Grey cast 
iron is formed when the carbon content in the 
alloy exceeds the amount that can be dissolved. 
Therefore, some part of carbon precipitates and 
remains present as ‘graphite ﬂ akes’ distributed in 
a matrix of ferrite or pearlite or their combination. 
When a component of grey cast iron is broken, 
the fractured surface has a grey appearance due to 
the graphite ﬂ akes. Grey cast iron is speciﬁ ed by 
the symbol FG followed by the tensile strength in
N/mm2 for a 30-mm section. For example, FG 
200, in general, means a grey cast iron with an 
ultimate tensile strength of 200 N/mm2. Grey cast 
iron is used for automotive components such as 
cylinder block, brake drum, clutch plate, cylinder 
and cylinder head, gears and housing of gear 
box, ﬂ ywheel and machine frame, bed and guide.
White cast iron is formed when most of the 
carbon content in the alloy forms iron carbide and 
there are no graphite ﬂ akes. Malleable cast iron is 
ﬁ rst cast as white cast iron and then converted into 
malleable cast iron by heat treatment. In malleable 
cast iron, the carbon is present in the form of 
irregularly shaped nodules of graphite called 
‘temper’ carbon. There are three basic types of 
malleable cast iron—blackheart, pearlitic and 
whiteheart—which are designated by symbols 
BM, PM and WM, respectively and followed by 
minimum tensile strength in N/mm2. For example,
 
(i) BM 350 is blackheart malleable cast iron 
with a minimum tensile strength of 350 N/
mm2;
 (ii) PM 600 is pearlitic malleable cast iron with 
a minimum tensile strength of 600 N/mm2; 
and
 (iii) WM 400 is whiteheart malleable cast 
iron with a minimum tensile strength of 400 
N/mm2.
Blackheart malleable cast iron has excellent 
castability and machinability. It is used for brake 
shoes, pedal, levers, wheel hub, axle housing and 
door hinges. Whiteheart malleable cast iron is 
particularly suitable for the manufacture of thin 
castings which require ductility. It is used for pipe 
ﬁ ttings, switch gear equipment, ﬁ ttings for bicycles 
and motorcycle frames. Pearlitic malleable iron 
castings can be hardened by heat treatment. It is 
used for general engineering components with 
speciﬁ c dimensional tolerances. 
Ductile cast iron is also called nodular cast 
iron or spheroidal graphite cast iron. In ductile 
cast iron, carbon is present in the form of spherical 
nodules called ‘spherulites’ or ‘globules’ in a 
relatively ductile matrix. When a component of 
ductile cast iron is broken, the fractured surface 
has a bright appearance like steel. Ductile cast 
iron is designated by the symbol SG (spheroidal 
graphite) followed by the minimum tensile strength 
in N/mm2 and minimum elongation in per cent. For 
example, SG 800/2 is spheroidal graphite cast iron 
with a minimum tensile strength of 800 N/mm2 
and a minimum elongation of 2%. Ductile cast 
iron is used for crankshaft, heavy duty gears and 
automobile door hinges. Ductile cast iron combines 
the processing advantages of grey cast iron with 
the engineering properties of steel. Spheroidal 
graphite cast iron is dimensionally stable at high 
temperatures and, therefore, used for furnace doors, 
furnace components and steam plants. Because 
28 Design of Machine Elements
of excellent corrosion resistance, it is used for 
pipelines in chemical and petroleum industries.

2.4 BIS SYSTEM OF DESIGNATION OF 
STEELS
A large number of varieties of steel are used for 
machine components. Steels are designated by a 
group of letters or numbers indicating any one of 
the following three properties: 5, 6
 
(i) tensile strength;
 (ii) carbon content; and
 (iii) composition of alloying elements.
Steels, which are standardised on the basis of 
their tensile strength without detailed chemical 
composition, are speciﬁ ed by two ways—a symbol 
Fe followed by the minimum tensile strength in 
N/mm2 or a symbol FeE followed by the yield 
strength in N/mm2. For example, Fe 360 indicates 
a steel with a minimum tensile strength of 360 
N/mm2. Similarly, FeE 250 indicates a steel with a 
minimum yield strength of 250 N/mm2.
The designation of plain carbon steel consists of 
the following three quantities:
 
(i) a ﬁ gure indicating 100 times the average 
percentage of carbon;
 (ii) a letter C; and
 (iii) a ﬁ gure indicating 10 times the average 
percentage of manganese.
As an example, 55C4 indicates a plain carbon 
steel with 0.55% carbon and 0.4% manganese. 
A steel with 0.35–0.45% carbon and 0.7–0.9% 
manganese is designated as 40C8.
The designation of unalloyed free cutting steels 
consists of the following quantities:
 
(i) a ﬁ gure indicating 100 times the average 
percentage of carbon;
 (ii) a letter C;
 (iii) a ﬁ gure indicating 10 times the average 
percentage of manganese;
 (iv) a symbol ‘S’, ‘Se’, ‘Te’ or ‘Pb’ depending 
upon the element that is present and which 
makes the steel free cutting; and
 (v) a ﬁ gure indicating 100 times the average 
percentage of the above element that makes 
the steel free cutting.
As an example, 25C12S14 indicates a free 
cutting steel with 0.25% carbon, 1.2% manganese 
and 0.14% sulphur. Similarly, a free cutting steel 
with an average of 0.20% carbon, 1.2% manganese 
and 0.15% lead is designated as 20C12Pb15. 
The term ‘alloy’ steel is used for low and 
medium alloy steels containing total alloying 
elements not exceeding 10%. The designation of 
alloy steels consists of the following quantities:
 
(i) a ﬁ gure indicating 100 times the average 
percentage of carbon; and
 (ii) chemical symbols for alloying elements 
each followed by the ﬁ gure for its average 
percentage content multiplied by a factor. 
The multiplying factor depends upon the 
alloying element. The values of this factor 
are as follows:
Elements
Multiplying factor
Cr, Co, Ni, Mn,
4
Si and W 
Al, Be, V, Pb, Cu,
10
Nb, Ti, Ta, Zr and 
Mo
P, S, N
100
In alloy steels, the symbol ‘Mn’ for manganese is 
included only if the content of manganese is equal 
to or greater than 1%. The chemical symbols and 
their ﬁ gures are arranged in descending order of 
their percentage content.
As an example, 25Cr4Mo2 is an alloy steel 
having average 0.25% of carbon, 1% chromium 
and 0.2% molybdenum. Similarly, 40Ni8Cr8V2 is 
an alloy steel containing average 0.4% of carbon, 
2% nickel, 2% chromium and 0.2% vanadium. 
Consider an alloy steel with the following 
composition:
carbon 
= 0.12–0.18%
silicon 
= 0.15–0.35%
manganese = 0.40–0.60%
chromium = 0.50–0.80%
 5 IS 1762–1974: Code for designation of steels.
 6 IS 1570–1978: Schedule for wrought steels.
30 Design of Machine Elements
The average percentage of carbon is 0.15%, 
which is denoted by the number (0.15 ¥ 100) or 15. 
The percentage content of silicon and manganese is 
negligible and, as such, they are deleted from the 
designation. The signiﬁ cant element is chromium 
and its average percentage is 0.65. The multiplying 
factor for chromium is 4 and (0.65 ¥ 4) is 2.6, 
which is rounded to 3. Therefore, the complete 
designation of steel is 15Cr3. As a second example, 
consider a steel with the following chemical 
composition:
carbon 
= 0.12–0.20%
silicon 
= 0.15–0.35%
manganese = 0.60–1.00%
nickel 
= 0.60–1.00%
chromium = 0.40–0.80%
The average percentage of carbon is 0.16% and 
multiplying this value by 100, the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure in the 
designation of steel is 16. The average percentage 
of silicon and manganese is very small and, as 
such, the symbols Si and Mn are deleted. Average 
percentages of nickel and chromium are 0.8 and 
0.6, respectively, and the multiplying factor for 
both elements is 4. Therefore,
nickel: 0.8 ¥ 4 = 3.2 rounded to 3 or Ni3
chromium: 0.6 ¥ 4 = 2.4 rounded to 2 or Cr2.
The complete designation of steel is 16Ni3Cr2. 
The term ‘high alloy steels’ is used for alloy 
steels containing more than 10% of alloying 
elements. The designation of high alloy steels 
consists of the following quantities:
 
(i) a letter ‘X’;
 (ii) a ﬁ gure indicating 100 times the average 
percentage of carbon;
 (iii) chemical symbol for alloying elements 
each followed by the ﬁ gure for its average 
percentage content rounded off to the nearest 
integer; and
 (iv) chemical symbol to indicate a specially added 
element to attain desired properties, if any.
As an example, X15Cr25Ni12 is a high alloy 
steel with 0.15% carbon, 25% chromium and 12% 
nickel. As a second example, consider a steel with 
the following chemical composition:
carbon 
= 0.15–0.25%
silicon 
= 0.10–0.50%
manganese = 0.30–0.50%
nickel 
= 1.5–2.5%
chromium = 16–20%
The average content of carbon is 0.20%, which 
is denoted by a number (0.20 ¥ 100) or 20. The 
major alloying elements are chromium (average 
18%) and nickel (average 2%). Hence, the 
designation of steel is X20Cr18Ni2.
2.5 
PLAIN CARBON STEELS
Depending upon the percentage of carbon, plain 
carbon steels are classiﬁ ed into the following three 
groups:
(i) Low Carbon Steel Low carbon steel contains 
less than 0.3% carbon. It is popular as ‘mild 
steel’. Low carbon steels are soft and very ductile. 
They can be easily machined and easily welded. 
However, due to low carbon content, they are 
unresponsive to heat treatment.
(ii) Medium Carbon Steel Medium carbon steel 
has a carbon content in the range of 0.3% to 0.5%. 
It is popular as machinery steel. Medium carbon 
steel is easily hardened by heat treatment. Medium 
carbon steels are stronger and tougher as compared 
with low carbon steels. They can be machined well 
and they respond readily to heat treatment.
(iii) High Carbon Steel High carbon steel contains 
more than 0.5% carbon. They are called hard 
steels or tool steels. High carbon steels respond 
readily to heat treatments. When heat treated, high 
carbon steels have very high strength combined 
with hardness. They do not have much ductility 
as compared with low and medium carbon steels. 
High carbon steels are difﬁ cult to weld. Excessive 
hardness is often accompanied by excessive 
brittleness. 
Plain carbon steels are available in the form of 
bar, tube, plate, sheet and wire. The mechanical 
properties of plain carbon steels7 are given in 
Table 2.2.

(Note: Minimum yield strength = 55% of minimum tensile strength)
Many times, a designer is faced with the aspect 
of choosing a correct carbon content for a particular 
application. This is an important decision because 
by merely changing the carbon content, one can get 
totally different properties of steels.
The guidelines for deciding carbon content in 
plain carbon steels are as follows:
 
(i) In applications like automobile bodies 
and hoods, the ability of the material to 
deform to a grater extent or ‘ductility’ is 
the most important consideration. Such 
a material should have high ductility. 
Ductility is measured in terms of percentage 
elongation. It is observed from Table 2.2, 
that lower the percentage of carbon, higher 
is the percentage of elongation or ductility. 
Therefore, a plain carbon steel, like 7C4, 
which has a lower percentage of carbon and 
a higher percentage of elongation, is selected 
for these parts.
 (ii) In 
applications 
like 
gears, 
machine 
tool spindles and transmission shafts, 
strength, toughness and response to heat 
treatment are important considerations. In 
these components, the surface is heavily 
stressed, while the stresses in the core are 
of comparatively small magnitude. These 
components  require a soft core and a hard 
surface. This is achieved by case hardening 
of gears, shafts and spindles. Medium and 
high carbon steels, such as 40C8, 45C8, 
50C4, 55C8, and 60C4 which are stronger, 
tougher and respond readily to heat 
treatment are, therefore, selected for these 
components. They can also be machined 
well to the required accuracy.
 (iii) Spring wires are subjected to severe 
stress and strength is the most important 
consideration in selection of their material. 
High carbon steel, such as 65C6, having 
maximum tensile strength, is selected for 
helical and leaf springs.
 (iv) Low and medium carbon steels can be 
satisfactorily welded. However, low carbon 
steels are the most easily welded. Higher the 
percentage of carbon in steel, more difﬁ cult 
it is to weld. Therefore, welded assemblies 
are made of low and medium carbon steels.
 (v) Low and medium carbon steels can be 
satisfactorily forged. However, low carbon 
steels that are very soft and ductile, are the 
most easily forged. Higher the percentage 
of carbon in steel, the more difﬁ cult it is to 
forge the part. Therefore, forged components 
such as levers, rocker arm, yoke or tie rod are 
made of low carbon steel 30C8. However, 
there are some forged components like 
connecting rod and crankshaft, which also 
require heat treatment after forging. They are 
32 Design of Machine Elements
made of medium carbon steel 40C8, which 
responds readily to heat treatment.
 (vi) All steels have essentially the same 
modulus of elasticity. Thus, if rigidity is 
the requirement of the component, all steels 
perform equally well. In this case, the least 
costly steel should be selected.
Some of the important applications of plain 
carbon steels are as follows:
7C4 Components 
made 
by 
severe 
drawing 
operation such as automobile bodies and hoods
10C4 Case hardened components such as cams 
and cam shaft, worm, gudgeon pin, sprocket and 
spindle
30C8 Cold formed and case hardened parts such 
as socket, tie rod, yoke, lever and rocker arm
40C8 Transmission shaft, crank shaft, spindle, 
connecting rod, stud and bolts
45C8 Transmission shaft, machine tool spindle, 
bolts and gears of large dimensions
50C4 Transmission shaft, worm, gears and cylinder
55C8 Components with moderate wear resistance 
such as gears, cam, sprocket, cylinder and key
60C4 Machine tool spindle, hardened bolt and 
pinion
65C6 Coil and leaf springs
2.6 
FREE CUTTING STEELS
Steels of this group include carbon steel and 
carbon–manganese steel with a small percentage 
of sulphur. Due to addition of sulphur, the 
machinability 
of 
these 
steels 
is 
improved. 
Machinability is deﬁ ned as the ease with which 
a component can be machined. It involves three 
factors—the ease of chip formation, the ability 
to achieve a good surface ﬁ nish and ability to 
achieve an economical tool life. Machinability 
is an important consideration for parts made by 
automatic machine tools. Typical applications 
of free cutting steels are studs, bolts and nuts. 
Mechanical properties of free cutting steels8 are 
given in Table 2.3.

ALLOY STEELS
Alloy steel is deﬁ ned as carbon steel to which one 
or more alloying elements are added to obtain 
certain beneﬁ cial effects. The commonly added 
elements include silicon, manganese, nickel, 
chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. The term 
‘alloy steels’ usually refers to ‘low’ alloy steels 
containing from about 1 to 4 per cent of alloying 
elements. On the other hand, stainless and heat-
resisting steels are called ‘high’ alloy steels. Plain 
carbon steels are successfully used for components 
subjected to low 
or 
medium 
stresses. 
These 
steels are cheaper than alloy steels. However, plain 
carbon steels have the following limitations:
 8 IS 1570 (Part 3)–1979: Schedules for wrought steel—carbon and carbon-manganese free cutting steels.
Engineering Materials 33
 
(i) The tensile strength of plain carbon steels 
cannot be increased beyond 700 N/mm2 
without substantial loss in ductility and 
impact resistance.
 (ii) Components with large section thickness 
cannot 
be produced 
with 
martensitic 
structure. In other words, plain carbon steels 
are not deep hardenable.
 (iii) Plain carbon steels have low corrosion 
resistance.
 (iv) Medium carbon steels must be quenched 
rapidly to obtain a fully martensitic structure. 
Rapid quenching results in distortion and 
cracking in heat-treated components.
 (v) Plain 
carbon 
steels have 
poor 
impact 
resistance at low temperatures.
To overcome these deﬁ ciencies of plain carbon 
steels, alloy steels have been developed. Alloy 
steels cost more than plain carbon steels. However, 
in many applications, alloy steel is the only choice 
to meet the requirements. Alloy steels have the 
following advantages:
 
(i) Alloy steels have higher strength, hardness 
and toughness.
 (ii) High values of hardness and strength can be 
achieved for components with large section 
thickness.
 (iii) Alloy steels possess higher hardenability, 
which has great signiﬁ cance in heat 
treatment of components.
 (iv) Alloy steels retain their strength and 
hardness at elevated temperatures.
 (v) Alloy steels have higher resistance to 
corrosion and oxidation compared with plain 
carbon steels.
Alloying elements can affect constitution, 
characteristics and behaviour of these steels. The 
effects of major alloying elements are as follows:
(i) Silicon Silicon is present in almost all steels. It 
increases strength and hardness without lowering 
the ductility. Silicon is purposely added in spring 
steel to increase its toughness.
(ii) 
Manganese Most 
steels 
contain 
some 
manganese remaining from the deoxidisation 
and desulphurisation processes. However, when 
it exceeds 1 per cent, it is regarded as an alloying 
element. Manganese is one of the least expensive 
alloying elements. It increases hardness and 
strength. It also increases the depth of hardening. 
Manganese is an important alloying element in free 
cutting steels.
(iii) Nickel Nickel increases strength, hardness 
and 
toughness 
without 
sacriﬁ cing 
ductility.
It increases hardenability of steel and impact 
resistance at low temperature. The main effect of 
nickel is to increase toughness by limiting grain 
growth during the heat treatment process.
(iv) Chromium Chromium increases hardness and 
wear resistance. Chromium steel components can 
be readily hardened in heavy sections. They retain 
strength and hardness at elevated temperatures. 
Chromium steels containing more than 4 per cent 
chromium have excellent corrosion resistance. 
(v) Molybdenum Molybdenum increases hardness 
and wear resistance. It resists softening of steel 
during tempering and heating.
(vi) Tungsten Tungsten and molybdenum have 
similar effects. It is an expensive alloying element 
and about 2 to 3 per cent tungsten is required 
to replace 1 per cent of molybdenum. It is an 
important alloying element in tool steels. 
Many times, a designer is faced with the aspect 
of choosing the correct alloying element of steels 
for a particular application. This is an important 
decision because by merely changing an alloying 
element, one can get totally different combinations 
of mechanical properties for steels. 
The guidelines for selecting alloy steels are as 
follows:
 
(i) Spring wires are subjected to severe 
stresses, and strength is the most important 
consideration in selection of their material. 
Silicon increases strength. Therefore, silicon 
steel, such as 55Si7, is selected for helical 
and leaf springs.
 (ii) In case of highly stressed screws, bolts 
and axles, high strength and toughness are 
important considerations. Nickel increases 
strength and toughness without loss of 
34 Design of Machine Elements
ductility. Therefore, nickel steel such as 
40Ni14 is used for these severely stressed 
components.
 (iii) In applications like gears, surface hardness, 
wear resistance and response to heat 
treatment are important considerations. In 
these components, the surface is heavily 
stressed, while the stresses in the core are 
of comparatively small magnitude. These 
components require a soft core and a hard 
surface. Chromium increases hardness and 
wear resistance. Also, chromium steels 
are readily hardened in heavy sections. 
Therefore, chromium steels, such as 40Cr4 
is selected for all types of gears. 
 (iv) In a number of components like gears, cams, 
camshafts, and transmission shafts, combined 
properties such as hardness and toughness, 
strength and ductility are required. This is 
achieved by using nickel and chromium as 
alloying elements and selecting proper heat 
treatment. Nickel–chromium steels, like 
16Ni3Cr2 or 30Ni16Cr5, which combines 
hardness and toughness, are selected for 
these parts.
Some of the important applications of alloy 
steels are as follows:
55Si7 Leaf and coil springs
37C15 Axle, shaft and crankshaft
35Mn6Mo3 Bolt, stud, axle, lever and general 
engineering components
16Mn5Cr4 Gears and shaft
40Cr4 Gears, axle and steering arm

and camshaft

OVERSEAS STANDARDS
Cast iron and steel are the essential ingredients in 
any product. A large variety of steel and cast iron 
is developed for a number of applications. In our 
country, collaborations with foreign industries have 
resulted in use of different overseas standards and 
designations. Some important designations for 
ferrous materials are as follows,10, 11, 12
 
(i) The American Society for Testing Materials 
(ASTM) has classiﬁ ed grey cast iron by 
means of a number. This class number 
gives minimum tensile strength in kpsi. For 
example, ASTM Class No. 20 has minimum 
ultimate tensile strength of 20000 psi. 
Similarly, a cast iron with minimum ultimate 
tensile strength of 50000 psi is designated 
as ASTM Class No. 50. Commonly used 
ASTM classes of cast iron are 20, 25, 30, 35, 
40, 50 and 60.

by minimum ultimate tensile strength in

grey cast iron with minimum ultimate tensile 
strength of 12 kgf/mm2. Similarly, grey cast 
iron with minimum ultimate tensile strength 
of 26 kgf/mm2 is designated as GG-26. The 
common varieties of grey cast iron according 
to DIN standard are GG-12, GG-14, GG-18, 
GG-22,GG-26 and GG-30.
 (iii) A numbering system for carbon and alloy 
steels is prescribed by the Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE) of USA and 
American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). 
It is based on chemical composition of the 
steel. The number is composed of four or 
ﬁ ve digits. The ﬁ rst two digits indicate the 
type or alloy classiﬁ cation. The last two or 
three digits give the carbon content. Since 
carbon is the most important element in 
steel, affecting the strength and hardness, it 
is given proper weightage in this numbering 
system. The basic numbers for various types 
of steel are given in Table 2.5. For example, 
plain carbon steel has 1 and 0 as its ﬁ rst 
two digits. Thus, a steel designated as 1045 
indicates plain carbon steel with 0.45% 
carbon. Similarly, a nickel–chromium steel 
with 1.25% Ni, 0.60% Cr and 0.40% carbon 
is speciﬁ ed as SAE 3140.
The AISI number for steel is the same as the 
SAE number. In addition, there is a capital letter A, 
B, C, D or E that is preﬁ xed to the number. These 
capital letters indicate the manufacturing process of 
steel. The meaning of these letters is as follows:
A—Basic open-hearth alloy steel
B—Acid Bessemer carbon steel
C—Basic open-hearth carbon steel
D—Acid open-hearth carbon steel
E—Electric furnace alloy steel
The British system designates steel is a series of 
numbers known as ‘En’ series. The En number of 
a steel has no correlation either with the chemical 
composition such as carbon content and types of 
alloying element or mechanical properties such as 
ultimate tensile strength. For example, the number 
3 in En3 steel has no relationship with the carbon 
content, alloying element or strength of steel. Table 
2.6 shows the overseas equivalent designations of 
some popular varieties of steel.

HEAT TREATMENT OF STEELS
The heat treatment process consists of controlled 
heating and cooling of components made of either 
plain carbon steel or alloy steel, for the purpose of 
changing their structure in order to obtain certain 
desirable properties like hardness, strength or 
ductility. The major heat treatment processes are as 
follows:
 
(i) Annealing consists of heating the component 
to a temperature slightly above the critical 
temperature, followed by slow cooling. It 
reduces hardness and increases ductility.
 (ii) Normalising is similar to annealing, except 
that the component is slowly cooled in air. It 
is used to remove the effects of the previous 
heat treatment processes.

 (iii) Quenching 
consists 
of 
heating 
the 
component to the critical temperature and 
cooling it rapidly in water or air. It increases 
hardness and wear resistance. However, 
during the process, the component becomes 
brittle and ductility is reduced.
 (iv) Tempering 
consists 
of 
reheating 
the 
quenched component to a temperature 
below the transformation range, followed 
by cooling at a desired rate. It restores the 
ductility and reduces the brittleness due to 
quenching.
The recommended hardening and tempering 
treatments and temperature ranges can be obtained 
from the standards. The selection of a proper heat 
treatment process depends upon the desirable 
properties of the component.
2.10 CASE HARDENING OF STEELS
In number of situations, the stress distribution 
across the cross-section of a component is not 
uniform. In some cases, the surface is heavily 
stressed, while the stress in the core is of 
comparatively small magnitude. The examples of 
this type of stress distribution are gear, cam and 
rolling contact bearing. The surface failure of these 
components can be avoided by case hardening. 
38 Design of Machine Elements
Case hardening can be achieved by the following 
two ways:
 
(i) by altering the structure at the surface by 
local hardening, e.g., ﬂ ame or induction 
hardening.
 (ii) by altering the structure as well as the 
composition at the surface, e.g., case 
carburising, nitriding, cyaniding and carbo-
nitriding.
Flame hardening consists of heating the 
surface above the transformation range by means 
of a ﬂ ame, followed by quenching. The distortion 
of the component is low because the bulk of the 
work piece is not heated. Flame hardening can be 
done in stages, such as hardening of tooth by tooth 
of a gear blank. The minimum case depth obtained 
by this process is 1 mm, although case depths up 
to 6 mm are quite common. Flame hardening is 
recommended under the following situations:
 
(i) where the component is large;
 (ii) where a small area of the work piece is to be 
hardened; and
 (iii) where dimensional accuracy is desirable.
Carbon steels containing more than 0.4% carbon 
are generally employed for ﬂ ame hardening.
The induction-hardening process consists of 
heating the surface by induction in the ﬁ eld of an 
alternating current. The amount of heat generated 
depends upon the resistivity of the material. 
Induction hardening produces case depths as small 
as 0.1 mm. There is not much difference between 
ﬂ ame and induction hardening, except for the mode 
of heating and minimum case depth. 
Case carburising consists of introducing 
carbon at the surface layer. Such a component has 
a high-carbon surface layer and a low-carbon core 
with a gradual transformation from one zone to 
the other. Different methods are used to introduce 
carbon, but all involve heating from 880 to 980°C. 
The carburising medium can be solid, liquid or gas. 
Case carburising is recommended for case depths 
up to 2 mm.
Carbo-nitriding consists of introducing carbon 
and nitrogen simultaneously at the surface layer. 
The component is heated from 650 to 920°C 
in the atmosphere of anhydrous ammonia and 
then quenched in a suitable medium. Nitrogen 
is concentrated at the surface and backed up by a 
carburised case. Medium carbon steels are carbo-
nitrided with case depths up to 0.6 mm. The 
process gives a higher wear resistance compared to 
the case-carburising process. Cyaniding is similar 
to carbo nitriding except that the medium is liquid.
Nitriding consists of exposing the component to 
the action of nascent nitrogen in a gaseous or liquid 
medium from 490 to 590°C. This process does not 
involve any subsequent quenching. The gaseous 
medium consists of dry ammonia. The liquid 
medium can be of cyanides and cyanates. The 
nitrided case consists of two zones—a brittle white 
zone next to the surface, consisting of nitrides, 
followed by a tougher diffusion zone, where 
nitrides are precipitated in the matrix. Case depths 
up to 0.1 mm are obtained by this process. Nitrided 
components are used for applications requiring 
high resistance to abrasion, high endurance limit 
and freedom from distortion. The disadvantages of 
this process are as follows:
 
(i) The components cannot be used for 
concentrated loads and shocks;
 (ii) The case depth is limited to 0.5 mm; and
 (iii) Considerable time is required for the process 
due to long cycle time.
The applications of the nitrided component 
are indexing worms, high-speed spindles and 
crankshafts.
2.11 CAST STEEL
Pouring 
molten 
steel 
of 
desired 
chemical 
composition into a mould and allowing the steel 
to solidify produces cast steel components. Steel 
castings can be made from any type of carbon 
and low alloy steels. Cast steel components 
and wrought steel components of equivalent 
chemical composition respond similarly to heat 
treatment, have the same weldability and have 
similar 
physical 
and 
mechanical 
properties. 
However, cast steel components do not exhibit the 
effects of directionality on mechanical properties 
that are typical of wrought steels. This non-
directional characteristic of cast steel components 
is 
advantageous 
where 
application 
involves 
multi-directional forces. Compared with cast 
Engineering Materials 39
iron components, the cast steel parts are lighter 
for the same strength. However, cast steels are 
costly and their superior mechanical properties 
are justiﬁ ed only in certain applications. Cast steel 
in its liquid form has poor ﬂ uidity compared with 
cast iron. Therefore, the wall thickness or section 
thickness cannot be made less than 6.5 mm. During 
solidiﬁ cation, cast steel shrinks to a greater extent. 
This results in residual stresses which cannot be 
completely relieved by the normalising process. 
Poor ﬂ uidity and excessive contraction should be 
taken into account while designing a component 
made of cast steel. It is always advisable to divide 
complicated one piece castings into simple parts 
and join them at the stage of assembly.
There are two varieties of steel castings: carbon 
steel castings and high tensile steel castings.13, 14 
Carbon steel castings are used for heavy duty 
machinery, highly stressed parts and gears. There 
are ﬁ ve grades of carbon steel castings. They are 
classiﬁ ed on the basis of minimum yield stress and 
tensile strength values respectively, expressed in 
N/mm2. For example, a carbon steel casting of 
grade 200–400 has a yield stress of 200 N/mm2 
and an ultimate tensile strength of 400 N/mm2. A 
carbon steel casting of yield stress and ultimate 
tensile strength of 280 and 520 N/mm2 respectively, 
will be designated as a carbon steel casting of grade 
280–520. The mechanical properties of carbon steel 
castings are given in Table 2.7.

High tensile steel castings have higher strength, 
good toughness and high resistance to wear. These 
castings are used in transportation equipment and 
agricultural machinery. There are ﬁ ve grades of 
high tensile steel castings which are classiﬁ ed 
according to the ultimate tensile strength, for 
example CS 640 is a steel casting with minimum 
ultimate tensile strength of 640 N/mm2. A high 
tensile steel casting with minimum ultimate tensile 
strength of 1030 N/mm2 is designated as CS 1030. 
The mechanical properties of high tensile steel 
castings are given in Table 2.8.

2.12 ALUMINIUM ALLOYS
Aluminium alloys are recent in origin compared 
with copper or steel. However, due to a unique 
combination of certain mechanical properties, they 
have become the most widely used nonferrous 
metal. Aluminium alloys offer the following design 
advantages: 
40 Design of Machine Elements
(i) Low Speciﬁ c Gravity The relative density of 
aluminium alloys is 2.7 compared with 7.9 of steel, 
i.e., roughly one third of steel. This results in light 
weight construction and reduces inertia forces in 
applications like connecting rod and piston, which 
are subjected to reciprocating motion.
(ii) Corrosion Resistance Aluminium has high 
afﬁ nity for oxygen and it might be expected that 
aluminium components will oxidise or rust very 
easily. However, in practice it has an excellent 
resistance to corrosion. This is due to the thin but 
very dense ﬁ lm of oxide (alumina skin) which 
forms on the surface of metal and protects it from 
further atmospheric attack. It is due to alumina skin 
that there is comparatively dull appearance on the 
surface of a polished aluminium component.
(iii) Ease of Fabrication Aluminium alloys have 
a face-centered cubic crystal structure with many 
slip planes. This makes the material ductile and 
easily shaped. They can be cast, rolled, forged 
or extruded. Aluminium alloys can be formed, 
hot or cold, with considerable ease. They can 
be machined easily if suitable practice and 
proper tools are used. They can be joined by 
fusion welding, resistance welding, soldering 
and brazing. Due to excellent malleability, it is 
possible to produce very thin aluminium foil 
suitable for food packaging. 
(iv) High Thermal Conductivity As a material for 
constructional components, aluminium has poor 
strength compared with steel. In ‘soft’ condition, 
the tensile strength of pure aluminium is only 90 
N/mm2, while even in work-hardened state, it is 
no more than 135 N/mm2. Hence, for engineering 
applications, aluminium is alloyed in order to 
obtain high strength to weight ratio. Some of the 
high strength aluminium alloys with suitable heat 
treatment have tensile strength in excess of 600 
N/mm2. There are two varieties of aluminium 
alloys–wrought and cast—which are used for 
machine components. Wrought aluminium alloys 
are available in the form of plates, sheets, strips, 
wires, rods and tubes. There are three methods of 
casting aluminium alloys, viz., sand casting, gravity 
die casting and pressure die casting.
Aluminium alloys are designated by a particular 
numbering system. The numbers given to alloying 
elements are given in Table 2.9.

Cast aluminium alloys are speciﬁ ed by a ‘four-
digit’ system while wrought alloys by a ‘ﬁ ve-digit’ 
system15, 16, 17, 18. The meaning of these digits is as 
follows:
First digit It identiﬁ es the major alloying element.
Second digit It identiﬁ es the average percentage of 
the major alloying element, halved and rounded off.
Third, fourth and ﬁ fth digits They identify the 
minor alloying elements in order of their decreasing 
percentage.
 As an example, consider an aluminium alloy 
casting with 9.8% Cu, 1.0% Fe and 0.25% Mg.

Some of the important applications of cast 
aluminium alloy are as follows:
Alloy 4450 Engine cylinder blocks, castings for 
valve body and large fan blades
Alloy 4600 Intricate and thin-walled castings, 
motor housings, water cooled manifolds and pump 
casings
Alloy 2280 Connecting rods and ﬂ ywheel housings
Alloy 2285 Pistons and cylinder heads
(Y-alloy) 
Alloy 2250 Castings for hydraulic equipment
Alloy 4652 Pistons for internal combustion engines.
The alloy 4600 is used for pressure die casting 
parts. It has excellent ﬂ uidity, which facilitates the 
production of complex castings of large surface 
area and thin walls. The mechanical properties of 
aluminium alloy castings are given in Table 2.10. 
The 
important 
applications 
of 
wrought 
aluminium alloy are as follows:
Alloy 24345 Heavy duty forging and structures
Alloy 24534 Stressed components of aircraft
Alloy 54300 Welded structures and tank
Alloy 64430 Roof truss and deep-drawn container
Alloy 74530 Welded pressure vessels.
The mechanical properties of wrought aluminium 
alloy are given in Table 2.11 on next page.
2.13 COPPER ALLOYS
Copper possesses excellent thermal and electrical 
conductivity. It can be easily cast, machined and 
brazed. It has good corrosion resistance. However, 
even with these advantages, pure copper is not

used in any structural application due to its poor 
strength. The tensile strength of copper is about 
220 N/mm2. Pure copper is mainly used for 
electrical and thermal applications. For structural 
applications, copper alloys are used instead of 
pure copper. Some of the popular copper alloys are 
brass, bronze, gunmetal and monel metal. Their 
properties and applications are brieﬂ y discussed in 
this article.

Engineering Materials 43
(i) Brass The most commonly used copper 
alloy is brass. It is an alloy of copper and zinc. 
Sometimes, it may contain small amounts of tin, 
lead, aluminium and manganese. Brass has the 
following advantages:
 
(i) The tensile strength of brass is higher than 
that of copper.
 (ii) Brass is cheaper than copper.
 (iii) Brass has excellent corrosion resistance.
 (iv) Brass has better machinability.
 (v) Brass has good thermal conductivity.
The strength and ductility of brass depend upon 
the zinc content. As the amount of zinc increases, 
the strength of brass increases and ductility 
decreases. The best combination of strength and 
ductility is obtained when the amount of zinc is 
30 per cent. Brass can be used either in rolled 
condition or as cast. Some of the commonly 
used varieties of brass are yellow brass, naval 
brass, cartridge brass and muntz metal. Typical 
applications of brass in the ﬁ eld of mechanical 
engineering are tubes for condensers and heat 
exchangers, automotive radiator cores, rivets, valve 
stems and bellow springs.
(ii) Bronze Bronze is an alloy of copper and 
elements other than zinc. In some cases, bronze 
may contain a small amount of zinc. There are 
three important varieties of bronze—aluminium 
bronze, phosphor bronze and tin bronze. Aluminium 
bronze contains 5 to 10 per cent aluminium. It has 
excellent corrosion resistance, high strength and 
toughness, low coefﬁ cient of friction and good 
damping properties. It is used for hydraulic valves, 
bearings, cams and worm gears. The colour of 
aluminium bronze is similar to that of 22 carat 
gold and it is frequently called ‘imitation’ gold. 
Aluminium bronze is difﬁ cult to cast because its 
casting temperature is around 1000°C. At this 
temperature, aluminium oxidises and creates 
difﬁ culties in casting.
Phosphor bronze contains about 0.2 per cent 
phosphorus. The effect of phosphorus is to increase 
the tensile strength and corrosion resistance and 
reduce the coefﬁ cient of friction. In cast form, 
phosphor bronze is widely used for worm wheels 
and bearings. In wrought form, it is used for 
springs, bellows, pumps, valves and chemical 
equipment. Tin bronze contains up to 18 per cent 
tin and sometimes small amounts of phosphorus, 
zinc or lead. It has excellent machinability, wear 
resistance and low coefﬁ cient of friction. It is used 
for pump castings, valve ﬁ ttings and bearings. High 
prices of both copper and tin, put limitations on the 
use of tin bronze.
In general, all varieties of bronze have the 
following advantages:
 
(i) excellent corrosion resistance;
 (ii) low coefﬁ cient of friction; and
 (iii) higher tensile strength than copper or brass.
The main limitation of bronze is its high cost.
(iii) Gunmetal Gunmetal is an alloy of copper 
which contains 10% tin and 2% zinc. The presence 
of zinc improves ﬂ uidity of gunmetal during 
casting process. Zinc is considerably cheaper than 
tin. Therefore, the total cost of gunmetal is less 
than that of bronze. In cast form, gunmetal is used 
for bearings. It has excellent corrosion resistance, 
high strength and low coefﬁ cient of friction.
(iv) Monel Metal Monel metal is a copper–nickel 
alloy. It contains 65% nickel and 32% copper. It has 
excellent corrosion resistance to acids, alkalis, brine 
water, sea water and other chemicals. It is mainly 
used for handling sulphuric and hydrochloric acids. 
It is also used for pumps and valves for handling 
the chemicals in process equipment.
2.14 DIE CASTING ALLOYS
The die casting process consists of forcing the 
molten metal into a closed metal die. This process 
is used for metals with a low melting point. 
The advantages of the die casting process are as 
follows:
 
(i) Small parts can be made economically in 
large quantities.
 (ii) Surface ﬁ nish obtained by this method is 
excellent and requires no further ﬁ nishing.
 (iii) Very thin sections or complex shapes can be 
obtained easily.
The drawbacks include the cost of dies and 
restriction on the size of the component, since only 
small parts can be die cast.
44 Design of Machine Elements
Die casting alloys are made from zinc, 
aluminium and magnesium. Brass can be die cast 
but its casting temperature is high. Zinc die castings 
are more popular due to their high strength, long die 
life and moderate casting temperature. Aluminium 
and magnesium die castings are light in weight but 
their casting temperature is higher than that of zinc 
die castings.
2.15 CERAMICS
Ceramics can be deﬁ ned as a compound of metallic 
and non-metallic elements with predominantly 
‘ionic’ interatomic bonding. The word ‘ceramic’ 
is derived from the Greek word keramos which 
means 
‘potter’s 
clay’. 
Traditional 
ceramics 
include refractories, glass, abrasives, enamels and 
insulating materials. However, many substances, 
which are now classed as ceramics in fact, contain 
no clay. Modern ceramics include metal oxides, 
carbides, borides, nitrides and silicates. Some of 
their examples are Magnesia (MgO), Alumina 
(Al2O3), Zirconia (ZrO2), Beryllia (BeO), Silicon 
carbide (SiC) and Tungsten carbide (TiC).
The advantages of modern engineering ceramics 
are as follows:
 
(i) Most of the ceramics possess high hardness. 
This increased hardness is due to the 
operation of strong covalent bonds between 
atoms in their crystal structure. Materials 
like silicon carbide and boron nitride are the 
examples of ceramics with high hardness. It 
is this property which makes them useful as 
abrasive powder and cutting tools.
 (ii) Ceramics 
have 
high 
melting 
points. 
Materials such as magnesia and alumina 
have melting points of 2800°C and 2040°C 
respectively. This property makes them 
excellent refractory materials for the lining 
of the furnaces.
 (iii) Ceramics are good thermal insulators. In 
most of the ceramics, there are no free 
conducting electrons and heat is conducted 
only by transfer of vibration energy from one 
atom to another. This is unlike free electrons 
in metals. Hence, ceramics possess excellent 
insulating property. This is another reason to 
use them as refractory material.
 (iv) Ceramics have extremely high electrical 
resistivity. Hence, they are used for electrical 
insulators. Porcelain is a popular insulating 
material. Alumina is used for spark-plug 
insulation.
 (v) The densities of ceramics are low compared 
with those of engineering metals. This 
results in lightweight components.
 (vi) Ceramics are chemically resistant to most 
of the acids, alkalis and organic substances. 
They are also unaffected by oxygen. 
This increases the durability of ceramic 
components.
Ceramics have certain drawbacks. Their main 
disadvantages are as follows:
 
(i) Ceramics are brittle in nature. They are 
highly susceptible to stress concentration. 
Presence of even a micro-crack may lead 
to failure because it acts as a stress raiser. 
In ceramics, there is no plastic deformation 
like metals and no redistribution of stresses. 
This results in brittle fracture like cast iron 
components.
 (ii) In ceramics, ductility is almost zero. This is 
mainly due to the presence of small voids in 
the structure of ceramic parts.
 (iii) Ceramics have poor tensile strength.
 (iv) There is a wide variation in strength values 
of ceramics. Even in identical specimens, 
the properties vary due to variation of 
internal pores. Hence, in design of ceramic 
components, 
a 
statistical 
approach 
is 
essential for calculating the values of 
strength.
 (v) Ceramics are difﬁ cult to shape and machine.
In this article, we will consider only recent 
applications of advanced ceramics in the automobile 
industry. A number of parts of automotive engines 
are nowadays made of ceramics. They include 
cylinder liners, pistons, valves and engine blocks. 
The principal advantages of ceramic engine 
components over conventional metal parts are as 
follows:
Engineering Materials 45
 
(i) ability 
to 
withstand 
higher 
operating 
temperature;
 (ii) excellent wear and corrosion resistance;
 (iii) lower frictional loss;
 (iv) ability to operate without cooling system; 
and
 (v) light weight construction with low inertia 
force.
Research is being conducted on gas turbine 
engines that employ ceramic rotors, stators, 
regenerators and combustion housings. Other 
applications include turbine blades for aircraft 
engines and surface coatings for the engine parts.
2.16 PLASTICS
Plastics are synthetic materials processed by heat 
and pressure. They are perhaps the most widely 
used group of polymers. There are two terms, 
which are used in understanding the construction of 
plastics, viz., monomer and polymer. A monomer 
is a group of atoms that constitutes one unit of a 
polymer chain. When monomers are subjected to 
heat and pressure, they join together to form a chain 
called polymer. A polymer is a non-metallic organic 
compound of high molecular weight consisting 
of a very long chain of monomers. The process 
of combining monomers into polymers is called 
polymerization. Figure 2.7 shows the construction 
of typical monomers and their corresponding 
polymers. In this ﬁ gure, atoms of carbon, hydrogen 
and other elements are represented by their 
chemical symbols and their bonds by radial lines.
When a short polymer chain is lengthened by 
adding more and more monomer units, the material 
becomes more dense and passes from gaseous state 
to liquid state, from liquid state to semi-solid state 
and ﬁ nally becomes a tough solid material. Let us 
consider the example of addition of (CH2) unit to a 
polymer chain as shown in Fig. 2.8.
 
(i) Initial composition is (CH4) which is 
methane gas.
 (ii) Addition of one unit of (CH2) to a methane 
molecule results in heavier ethane gas with 
(C2H6) composition.
 (iii) Further addition of (CH2) units to the ethane 
chain results in pentane, which is in liquid 
form with (C5H12) composition.

46 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 2.8 Monomer Chains
 (iv) If the process of adding (CH2) units to the 
pentane chain is continued, parafﬁ n wax 
is obtained. It is in a semi-solid stage with
(C18 H38) composition.
 (v) If the process is further continued, a solid 
plastic called low-density polyethylene 
is obtained at approximately (C100 H102) 
composition.
 (vi) In the next stage, high-density polyethylene 
is obtained. It contains about half-million 
(CH2) units in a single chain. It is a very 
tough solid plastic.
Adding a terminal link called terminator, which 
satisﬁ es the bonds at each end of the chain, stops 
the linking of monomer units.
Knowing the construction of a monomer and 
polymer, we can deﬁ ne the term plastic at this 
stage. A plastic can be deﬁ ned as a solid material 
consisting of an organic polymer of a long 
molecular chain and high molecular weight. It may 
also contain some additives like ﬁ llers, plasticisers, 
ﬂ ame retardants and pigments. A ﬁ ller is an inert 
foreign substance added to a polymer to improve 
certain properties such as tensile and compressive 
strengths, abrasion resistance, toughness and 
dimensional and thermal stability. Filler materials 
include ﬁ nely powdered sawdust, silica ﬂ oor and 
sand, clay, limestone and talc. A plasticiser is low-
molecular weight polymer additive that improves 
ﬂ exibility, ductility and toughness and reduces 
brittleness and stiffness. They include polyvinyl 
chloride and acetate copolymers. A ﬂ ame retardant 
is an additive which increases ﬂ ammability 
resistance. Most polymers are ﬂ ammable in their 
pure form. A ﬂ ame retardant interferes with the 
combustion process and prevents burning. A 
pigment or colourant imparts a speciﬁ c colour to 
the plastic material.
Plastics are divided into two basic groups 
depending 
on 
their 
behaviour 
at 
elevated 
temperatures, viz., thermoplastics and thermosetting 
plastics. A thermoplastic is a polymeric material 
which softens when heated and hardens upon 
cooling. A thermosetting plastic is a polymeric 
material, which once having cured or hardened 
by a chemical reaction does not soften or melt 
upon subsequent heating. In short, a thermoplastic 
softens with heat while a thermosetting plastic 
does not. A thermoplastic material can be moulded 
and remoulded repeatedly. This difference in 
properties of thermoplastic and thermosetting 
plastic materials is due to molecular structures of 
their polymer chains. A thermoplastic material has 
a linear polymer chain while a thermosetting plastic 
material consists of a cross-linked polymer chain as 
Fig. 2.9 Linear and Cross-linked Polymer Chains
shown in Fig. 2.9. The difference between the two 
categories of plastic is as follows:
 
(i) A thermoplastic material has a linear 
polymer chain. A thermosetting plastic 
material has cross-linked polymer chain.
 (ii) A thermoplastic material can be softened, 
hardened or resoftened repeatedly by the 
application of heat. Alternate heating and 
Engineering Materials 47
cooling can reshape them. On the other hand, 
thermosetting plastic materials, once set and 
hardened, cannot be remelted or reshaped.
 (iii) Thermoplastic materials can be recycled. 
Therefore, thermoplastic components are 
environmentally friendly. It is not possible 
to recycle a thermosetting plastic material. 
Disposal of components made of thermosetting 
plastic material, after their useful life, creates a 
problem.
 (iv) Molecules in a linear chain can slide 
over each other. Therefore, thermoplastic 
materials are ﬂ exible. On the other hand, 
cross-linked thermosetting materials are 
more rigid. Their rigidity increases with the 
number of cross-links.
 (v) Common 
examples 
of 
thermoplastic 
materials are polyethylene, polypropylene, 
polyvinylchloride 
(PVC), 
polystyrene, 
polytetraﬂ uoethylene (PTFE) and nylon. 
Common examples of thermosetting plastic 
materials are phenolics, aminos, polyesters, 
epoxies and phenal-formaldehyde.
As a material for machine component, plastics 
offer the following advantages:
 
(i) Plastic materials have low speciﬁ c gravity 
resulting in lightweight construction. The 
speciﬁ c gravity of the heaviest plastic is 2.3 
compared with 7.8 of cast iron.
 (ii) Plastics have high corrosion resistance in 
any atmospheric condition. This is the most 
important advantage of plastic materials over 
metals. Many varieties of plastic materials 
are acid-resistant and can endure chemicals 
for a long period of time. PVC has excellent 
resistance to acids and alkalis.
 (iii) Some 
plastic 
materials 
have 
low 
coefﬁ cient of friction and self-lubricating 
property. The coefﬁ cient of friction of 
polytetraﬂ uoroethylene, commonly called 
Teﬂ on, is as low as 0.04. Such materials are 
ideally suitable for bearings.
 (iv) Fabrication 
of 
plastic 
components 
is 
easy. Raw material is available in the 
form of powders, granules or compressed 
pills. The raw material is converted into 
plastic parts by compression moulding, 
injection moulding, transfer moulding or 
extrusion process. Compression moulding 
is commonly used for components made of 
thermosetting plastic materials. Injection 
moulding is widely used for parts made 
of 
thermoplastics. 
Complicated 
parts 
performing several functions can be moulded 
from plastic material in a single operation.
Plastic materials have the following disadvan-
tages:
 
(i) Plastic materials have poor tensile strength 
compared with other construction materials. 
The tensile strength of plastic materials 
varies from 10 N/mm2 to 80 N/mm2.
 (ii) Mechanical 
properties 
of 
engineering 
metals do not vary much within the range 
of ambient temperatures encountered in 
practice. For many polymers, particularly 
thermoplastic materials, the mechanical 
properties vary considerably with tempera-
ture in the ambient region. For example, a 
thermoplastic material may have a tensile 
strength of 70 N/mm2 at 0°C, falling to 40 
N/mm2 at 25°C and further to 10 N/mm2 at 
80°C.
 (iii) A number of polymeric materials display 
viscoelastic mechanical behaviour. These 
materials behave like a glass at low 
temperatures, a rubbery solid at intermediate 
temperatures and a viscous liquid as the 
temperature is further increased. Therefore, 
such materials are elastic at low temperature 
and obey Hooke’s law and at high 
temperatures, a liquid-like behaviour prevails. 
At intermediate temperatures, the rubberlike 
solid state exhibits combined mechanical 
characteristics of these two extremes. This 
condition is called viscoelasticity.
 (iv) Many plastic materials are susceptible 
to time-dependent deformation when the 
stress level is maintained constant. Such 
deformation is called creep. This type of 
deformation is signiﬁ cant even at room 
temperature and under moderate stresses, 
which are even below the yield strength 
48 Design of Machine Elements
of the material. Due to creep, a machine 
component of plastic material under load 
may acquire a permanent set even at room 
temperature.
Although a large number of plastics are 
developed, we will consider a few materials in 
this article. These materials are mainly used for 
machine components. The names in brackets 
indicate popular trade names of the material.
(i) Polyamide (Nylon, Capron Nylon, Zytel, 
Fosta) Polyamide is a thermoplastic material. It 
has excellent toughness and wear resistance. The 
coefﬁ cient of friction is low. It is used for gears, 
bearings, conveyor rollers and automotive cooling 
fans.
(ii) Low-density Polyethylene (Polythene) It is a 
thermoplastic material. It is ﬂ exible and tough, light 
in weight, easy to process and a low-cost material. 
It is used for gaskets, washers and pipes.
(iii) Acetal (Delrin) It is a thermoplastic and 
a strong engineering material with exceptional 
dimensional stability. It has low coefﬁ cient of 
friction and high wear resistance. It is used for self-
lubricating bearings, cams and running gears.
(iv) Polyurethane (Duthane, Texin) It is a 
thermoplastic and a tough, abrasion-resistant and 
impact-resistant material. It has good dimensional 
properties and self-lubricating characteristics and is 
used for bearings, gears, gaskets and seals.
(v) 
Polytetraﬂ uoroethylene 
(Teﬂ on) It 
is 
a 
thermoplastic material. It has low coefﬁ cient of 
friction and self-lubricating characteristics. It can 
withstand a wide range of temperatures from –260 
to + 250°C. It is ideally suitable for self-lubricating 
bearing.
(vi) Phenolic It is a thermosetting plastic material. 
It has low cost with a good balance of mechanical 
and thermal properties. It is used in clutch and 
brake linings as ﬁ ller material. Glass reinforced 
phenolic is used for pulleys and sheaves.
The mechanical properties of plastic materials 
are given in Table 2.12.

2.17 FIBRE REINFORCED PLASTICS
Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) is a composite 
material in which the low strength of the polymeric 
material is increased by means of high strength 
ﬁ bres. There are two main constituents of ﬁ bre 
reinforced plastic, viz., matrix and ﬁ bres. The 
function of the matrix is to provide a rigid base for 
holding the ﬁ bres in correct position. The function 
of the ﬁ bres is to transmit the load acting on the 
component. The bond between the surface of the 
ﬁ bres and surrounding matrix is usually chemical. 
The matrix protects the ﬁ bres from surface damage 
and from the action of environment. The ﬁ bres used 
in composite should be long enough so that the 
bonding force between the surface of the ﬁ bre and 
the surrounding matrix is greater than the tensile 
strength of the ﬁ bre.
Two types of ﬁ bres are widely used, viz., 
glass and carbon ﬁ bres. The advantages of glass 
reinforced plastics (GRP) are as follows:
 
(i) Glass can be easily drawn into ﬁ bres from 
the molten state.
 (ii) Glass is cheaper and readily available.
 (iii) Glass ﬁ bre is relatively strong.
 (iv) Glass is chemically inert with respect to 
plastic matrix materials.
The disadvantages of glass reinforced plastic are 
as follows:
 
(i) Glass reinforced plastic has poor rigidity and 
stiffness.
Engineering Materials 49
 (ii) Its application is limited up to a temperature 
of 300°C.
Glass reinforced plastic is used for automotive 
bodies, pipes, valve bodies, pump casings and 
storage containers. It is more popular for vehicle 
bodies due to low speciﬁ c gravity resulting in 
lightweight construction.
The advantages of carbon reinforced plastics 
(CRP) are as follows:
 
(i) Carbon 
ﬁ bre 
has 
maximum 
strength 
compared with all other ﬁ bre materials.
 (ii) Carbon ﬁ bre retains its strength at elevated 
temperature.
 (iii) Moisture, acids and solvents at ambient 
temperature do not affect carbon ﬁ bre.
 (iv) Carbon reinforced plastic is relatively cheap.
There is one limitation for carbon reinforced 
plastic. Manufacturing techniques required to 
produce carbon ﬁ bre are relatively complicated. 
Carbon reinforced plastic is used for pressure 
vessels, aircraft components and casings of rocket 
motors.
Matrix material used in GRP and CRP should 
remain stable at the temperatures encountered 
in the application. It should not be affected by 
moisture and surrounding atmosphere. Both 
thermoplastic and thermosetting plastics are used 
as matrix materials. Nylon is a commonly used 
thermoplastic, while phenolic resins are popular 
thermosetting plastics for the matrices of the 
reinforced composites.
As an engineering material for structural 
components, ﬁ bre reinforced plastic offers the 
following advantages:
 
(i) It has low speciﬁ c gravity resulting in 
lightweight construction.
 (ii) It has high speciﬁ c strength and modulus of 
elasticity.
 (iii) It has good resistance to fatigue failure, 
particularly parallel to the direction of the 
ﬁ bres.
 (iv) It has good resistance to corrosion.
The term speciﬁ c strength means the ratio of 
the tensile strength to the speciﬁ c gravity of the 
material.
The disadvantages of ﬁ bre reinforced plastic are 
as follows:
 
(i) A composite material containing ﬁ bres in 
a single direction is extremely anisotropic. 
The tensile strength of such a material in 
a direction perpendicular to that of ﬁ bres 
may be 5% or even less than that measured 
in the direction of ﬁ bres. Many times, the 
transverse strength is less than that of the 
matrix material because of the presence 
of discontinuities and insufﬁ cient binding 
between the ﬁ bres and the surrounding 
matrix material.
 (ii) The design of components made of ﬁ bre 
reinforced plastics is complex. It is necessary 
to know the direction of principal stresses 
in such components. The ﬁ bres are aligned 
along the direction of principal stresses.
 (iii) The manufacturing and testing of ﬁ bre 
reinforced components is highly specialised. 
Fibre reinforced composite is a comparatively 
new material. It is being increasingly used for 
machine and structural parts such as motor shafts, 
gears and pulleys. Such materials are ‘custom-
made’ materials, which combine the desirable 
characteristics of two or more materials in a given 
required manner.
2.18 NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC  
 
 
RUBBERS
Natural rubber is obtained from rubber latex, which 
is a milky liquid obtained from certain tropical 
trees. It is a low cost elastomer. Different varieties 
of rubber are obtained by adding carbon, silica and 
silicates. Vulcanised rubber is obtained by adding 
sulphur, which is followed by heating. Addition of 
carbon makes the rubber hard. Natural rubber, in 
hard and semi-hard conditions, is used for belts, 
bushes, ﬂ exible tubes and vibration mounts. It is 
also used for production of coatings, protective 
ﬁ lms and adhesives. Rubber coatings provide 
protection in a chemical environment.
Synthetic rubber has properties similar to those 
of natural rubber. It can be thermoplastic or a 
thermosetting plastic. It is, however, costlier than 
50 Design of Machine Elements
natural rubber. A few applications of synthetic 
rubber are as follows:
(i) Chloroprene (Neoprene) Conveyors and V 
belts, brake diaphragms and gaskets
(ii) Nitrile Butadiene (NBR) Bushes for ﬂ exible 
coupling and rubber rollers
(iii) Polysulﬁ de (Thikol) Gaskets, washers and 
diaphragms
(iv) Chlorosulfonyl Polyethylene (Hypalon) Tank 
lining, high temperature conveyor belts, seals and 
gaskets
(iv) Silicone Seals, gaskets and O-rings
2.19 CREEP
When a component is under a constant load, it may 
undergo progressive plastic deformation over a 
period of time. This time-dependent strain is called 
creep. Creep is deﬁ ned as slow and progressive 
deformation of the material with time under a 
constant stress. Creep deformation is a function 
of stress level and temperature. Therefore, creep 
deformation is higher at higher temperature and 
creep becomes important for components operating 
at elevated temperatures. Creep of bolts and pipes 
is a serious problem in thermal power stations. 
The material of steam or gas turbine blades should 
have a low creep rate, so that blades can remain 
in service for a long period of time before having 
to be replaced due to their reaching the maximum 
allowable strain. These blades operate with very 
close clearances and permissible deformation is 
an important consideration in their design. Design 
of components working at elevated temperature is 
based on two criteria. Deformation due to creep 
must remain within permissible limit and rupture 
must not occur during the service life. Based on 
these two criteria, there are two terms—creep 
strength and creep rupture strength. Creep strength 
of the material is deﬁ ned as the maximum stress 
that the material can withstand for a speciﬁ ed 
length of time without excessive deformation. 
Creep rupture strength of the material is the 
maximum stress that the material can withstand for 
a speciﬁ ed length of time without rupture.
An idealised creep curve is shown in Fig. 2.10. 
When the load is applied at the beginning of the 
creep test, the instantaneous elastic deformation 
OA occurs. This elastic deformation is followed
Fig. 2.10 Creep Curve
by the creep curve ABCD. Creep occurs in three 
stages. The ﬁ rst stage called primary creep is 
shown by AB on the curve. During this stage, the 
creep rate, i.e., the slope of the creep curve from 
A to B progressively decreases with time. The 
metal strain hardens to support the external load. 
The creep rate decreases because further strain 
hardening becomes more and more difﬁ cult. The 
second stage called secondary creep is shown by 
BC on the curve. During this stage, the creep rate 
is constant. This stage occupies a major portion of 
the life of the component. The designer is mainly 
concerned with this stage. During secondary 
creep, recovery processes involving highly mobile 
dislocations counteract the strain hardening so 
that the metal continues to elongate at a constant 
rate. The third stage called tertiary creep is 
shown by CD on the creep curve. During this 
stage, the creep rate is accelerated due to necking 
and also due to formation of voids along the grain 
boundaries. Therefore, creep rate rapidly increases 
and ﬁ nally results in fracture at the point D. Creep 
properties are determined by experiments and these 
experiments involve very long periods stretching 
into months.

2.20 SELECTION OF MATERIAL
Selection of a proper material for the machine 
component is one of the most important steps in the 
process of machine design. The best material is one 
which will serve the desired purpose at minimum 
cost. It is not always easy to select such a material 
and the process may involve the trial and error 
method. The factors which should be considered 
while selecting the material for a machine 
component are as follows:
(i) Availability The material should be readily 
available in the market, in large enough quantities 
to meet the requirement. Cast iron and aluminium 
alloys are always available in abundance while 
shortage of lead and copper alloys is a common 
experience.
(ii) Cost For every application, there is a limiting 
cost beyond which the designer cannot go. When 
this limit is exceeded, the designer has to consider 
other alternative materials. In cost analysis, there 
are two factors, namely, cost of material and 
the cost of processing the material into ﬁ nished 
goods. It is likely that the cost of material might 
be low, but the processing may involve costly 
manufacturing operations.
(iii) Mechanical Properties Mechanical properties 
are the most important technical factor governing 
the selection of material. They include strength 
under static and ﬂ uctuating loads, elasticity, 
plasticity, stiffness, resilience, toughness, ductility, 
malleability and hardness. Depending upon the 
service conditions and the functional requirement, 
different mechanical properties are considered 
and a suitable material is selected. For example, 
the material for the connecting rod of an internal 
combustion engine should be capable to withstand 
ﬂ uctuating stresses induced due to combustion 
of fuel. In this case, endurance limit becomes the 
criterion of selection. The piston rings should have 
a hard surface to resist wear due to rubbing action 
with the cylinder surface, and surface hardness is 
the selection criterion. In case of bearing materials, 
a low coefﬁ cient of friction is desirable while 
clutch or brake lining requires a high coefﬁ cient 
of friction. The material for automobile bodies and 
hoods should have the ability to be extensively 
deformed in plastic range without fracture, and 
plasticity is the criterion of material selection. 
(iv) 
Manufacturing 
Considerations In 
some 
applications, machinability of material is an 
important consideration in selection. Sometimes, 
an expensive material is more economical than 
a low priced one, which is difﬁ cult to machine. 
Free cutting steels have excellent machinability, 
which is an important factor in their selection for 
high strength bolts, axles and shafts. Where the 
product is of complex shape, castability or ability 
of the molten metal to ﬂ ow into intricate passages 
is the criterion of material selection. In fabricated 
assemblies of plates and rods, weldability becomes 
the governing factor. The manufacturing processes, 
such as casting, forging, extrusion, welding and 
machining govern the selection of material. 
Past experience is a good guide for the selection 
of material. However, a designer should not 
overlook the possibilities of new materials.
2.21 WEIGHTED POINT METHOD
In recent years, systematic methods have been 
developed for selection of materials. One such 
method is the weighted point method. It consists of 
the following four steps:
 
(i) The ﬁ rst step consists of the study of the 
given application and preparing a list of the 
desirable properties of the material for the 
application. 
 (ii) The desirable properties are then assigned 
values. The approximate range of these 
properties, such as yield strength, endurance 
strength, hardness, etc., is speciﬁ ed.
 (iii) The desirable properties are divided into 
two groups—Go-no-go parameters and 
discriminating parameters. The Go-no-
go parameters are the constraints. As an 
example, if a material is not available, or if 
it cannot be fabricated into a given shape, it 
is totally rejected. This is a screening step 
52 Design of Machine Elements
and only those materials, which meet the 
essential requirement, are allowed further 
consideration.
 (iv) The discriminating parameters are the 
properties of the material which can be given 
quantitative values. The weightage depends 
upon the importance of that particular 
property in the given application. As an 
example, in case of a connecting rod, the 
endurance strength may be given a weighting 
factor of 5, compared with the cost having 
a weighting factor of 1. In general, the 
weighting factor varies from 1 to 5, with 1 for 
the poorest and 5 for the best.
Then each property of the candidate material is 
assigned a rating, ranging from 1 to 5, depending 
upon how closely it meets the requirements. These 
ratings are multiplied by the weighting factors for 
each property. These numbers are ﬁ nally added and 
materials are arranged in descending order of their 
total points.
The main drawback of this method is the 
skill and judgement required for assigning the 
weightage. The results may not be numerically 
correct; however, one can get a priority list of 
materials for a given application.
Example 2.1 
It is required to select a material 
by the weighted point method. There are four 
candidate materials, viz., low alloy steel, plain 
carbon steel, stainless steel and chromium steel, 
which have passed through screening test. For a 
particular application, the designer has given a 
5-point weightage for ultimate tensile strength, 
3-point weightage for hardenability and 2-point 
weightage for cost-economy. Table 2.13 gives the 
data for the candidate materials.

3.1 SELECTION OF MANUFACTURING
 
METHOD
Manufacturing of the product is an important link in 
the chain of events that begins with the concept of a 
probable product and ends with a competitive product 
in the market place. Product design, selection of 
materials and processing the materials into ﬁ nished 
components are closely related to one another. 
Manufacturing can be considered as processing the 
available material into useful components of the 
product, e.g., converting a mild steel sheet into car 
body, converting a billet of cast iron into a machine 
tool bed or converting a steel bar into a transmission 
shaft. The manufacturing   processes can be broadly 
classiﬁ ed into the following three categories:
(i) Casting Processes In these processes, molten 
metals such as cast iron, copper, aluminium or non-
metals like plastic are poured into the mould and 
solidiﬁ ed into the desired shape, e.g., housing of 
gear box, ﬂ ywheel with rim and spokes, machine 
tool beds and guides.
(ii) Deformation Processes In these processes, a 
metal, either hot or cold, is plastically deformed 
into the desired shape. Forging, rolling, extrusion, 
press working are the examples of deformation 
processes.    The   products    include   connecting 
rods, crankshafts,  I-section beams, car bodies and 
springs.
(iii) Material Removal or Cutting Processes In 
these processes, the material is removed by means 
of sharp cutting tools. Turning, milling, drilling, 
shaping, planing, grinding, shaving and lapping are 
the examples of material removal processes. The 
products include transmission shafts, keys, bolts 
and nuts.
In addition, there are joining processes like 
bolting, welding and riveting. They are essential for 
the assembly of the product.
Many times, a number of manufacturing methods 
are available to make the component. In such cases, 
the optimum manufacturing method is selected by 
considering the following factors:
 
(i) Material of the component
 
(ii) Cost of manufacture
 (iii) Geometric shape of the component
 (iv) Surface ﬁ nish and tolerances required
 
(v) Volume of production
One of the easiest methods to convert the raw 
material into the ﬁ nished component is casting. 
There are several casting processes such as sand 
casting, shell-mould casting, permanent mould 
casting, die casting, centrifugal casting or investment 
casting. Sand casting is the most popular casting 
process. The advantages of sand casting process as 
a manufacturing method are as follows:
 
(i) The tooling required for casting process 
is relatively simple and inexpensive. This 
56 Design of Machine Elements
reduces the cost. Sand casting is one of the 
cheapest methods of manufacturing. 
 
(ii) Almost any metal such as cast iron, 
aluminium, brass or bronze can be cast by 
this method.
 (iii) Any component, even with a complex shape, 
can be cast. There is no limit on the size of 
the component. Even large components can 
be cast.
The disadvantages of the sand casting process 
are as follows:
 
(i) It is not possible to achieve close tolerances 
for cast components. Therefore, cast 
components require additional machining 
and ﬁ nishing, which increases cost.
 
(ii) Cast components have a rough surface 
ﬁ nish.
 (iii) Long and thin sections or projections are not 
possible for cast components.
One of the important deformation processes 
is forging. In forging, the metal in the plastic 
stage, rather than in the molten stage, is forced to 
ﬂ ow into the desired shape. There are a number 
of forging processes such as hand forging, drop 
forging, press forging or upset forging. The drop-
forging method accounts for more than 80% of the 
forged components. The advantages of forging as a 
manufacturing method are as follows:
 
(i) The ﬁ brelines of a forged component can be 
arranged in a predetermined way to suit the 
direction of external forces that will act on 
the component when in service. Therefore, 
forged components have inherent strength 
and toughness. They are ideally suitable 
for applications like connecting rods and 
crankshafts.
 
(ii) In forging, there is relatively good utilisation 
of material compared with machining.
 (iii) Forged components can be provided with 
thin sections, without reducing the strength. 
This results in lightweight construction.
 (iv) The tolerances of forged parts can be held 
between close limits, which reduce the 
volume of material removal during the ﬁ nal 
ﬁ nishing stages.
 
(v) The forging process has a rapid production 
rate and good reproducibility.
The disadvantages of the forging process are as 
follows:
 
(i) Forging is a costly manufacturing method. 
The equipment and tooling required for 
forging is costly.
 
(ii) Forging becomes economical only when the 
parts are manufactured on a large scale.
Material removal or cutting processes are the most 
versatile and most common manufacturing methods. 
Almost every component is subjected to some kind 
of machining operation in its ﬁ nal ﬁ nishing stage. 
Metal removal processes are broadly divided into 
three categories—metal cutting processes, grinding 
processes and unconventional machining processes. 
Depending upon the shape of machined surfaces, 
the metal removal processes are selected in the 
following way:
 
(i) For machining ﬂ at surfaces, shaping, planing 
and milling processes are usually used. A ﬂ at 
surface can also be machined on a lathe by 
the facing operation. Broaching and surface 
grinding are ﬁ nishing methods for ﬂ at 
surfaces.
 
(ii) For machining external cylindrical surface, 
turning on lathe is a popular method. Such 
surfaces are ﬁ nished by the cylindrical 
grinding method.
 (iii) For machining internal cylindrical surfaces, 
drilling and boring are popular processes. 
Reaming and cylindrical grinding are 
ﬁ nishing processes.
The advantages of metal cutting processes as a 
manufacturing method are as follows:
 
(i) Almost any metal can be machined.
 
(ii) It is possible to achieve close tolerances for 
machined components.
 (iii) Machined components have a good surface 
ﬁ nish.
The disadvantages of machining processes are as 
follows:
 
(i) Machining processes are costly and the rate 
of production is low compared with casting 
or forging.
Manufacturing Considerations in Design 57
 
(ii) It is not possible to machine thin sections or 
projections.
 (iii) There is wastage of material during material 
removal process.
In drilling operation, the cost of the hole increases 
linearly with the depth of the hole. However, when 
the depth is more than three times the diameter, the 
cost increases more rapidly. 
3.2 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF   
CASTINGS
Complex parts, which are otherwise difﬁ cult to 
machine, are made by the casting process using 
sand mould. Almost any metal can be melted and 
cast. Most of the sand cast parts are made of cast 
iron, aluminium alloys and brass. The size of the 
sand casting can be as small as 10 g and as large 
as 200 ¥ 103 kg. Sand castings have irregular and 
grainy surfaces and machining is required if the 
part is moving with respect to some other part or 
structure. Cast components are stable, rigid and 
strong compared with machined or forged parts. 
Typical examples of cast components are machine 
tool beds and structures, cylinder blocks of internal 
combustion engines, pumps and gear box housings.
Poor shaping of a cast iron component can 
adversely affect its strength more than the 
composition of the material. Before designing 
castings, the designer should consult the foundry 
man and the patternmaker, whose cooperation 
is essential for a successful design. The general 
principles for the design of casting1 are as follows:
Always Keep the Stressed Areas of the Part in 
Compression Cast iron has more compressive 
strength than its tensile strength. The balanced 
sections with equal areas in tension and compression 
are not suitable for cast iron components. The 
castings should be placed in such a way that they are 
subjected to compressive rather than tensile stresses 
as illustrated in Fig. 3.1. When tensile stresses are 
unavoidable, a clamping device such as a tie rod 
or a bearing cap as illustrated in Fig. 3.2 should be 
considered. The clamping device relieves the cast 
iron components from tensile stresses.

Round 
All 
External 
Corners It 
has 
two 
advantages—it increases the endurance limit of 
the component and reduces the formation of brittle 
chilled edges. When the metal in the corner cools 
faster than the metal adjacent to the corner, brittle 
chilled edges are formed due to iron carbide.

Appropriate ﬁ llet radius, as illustrated in Fig. 3.3 
reduces the stress concentration. The values of the 
corner radii for different section thickness are given

Wherever Possible, the Section Thickness 
throughout should be Held as Uniform as 
Compatible with Overall Design Considera-
tions Abrupt changes in the cross-section result 
in high stress concentration. If the thickness is to 
be varied at all, the change should be gradual as 
illustrated in Fig. 3.4.
Fig. 3.4 Change in Section-thickness
Avoid Concentration of Metal at the Junctions At 
the junction as shown in Fig. 3.5, there is a 
concentration of metal. Even after the metal on the 
surface solidiﬁ es, the central portion still remains 
in the molten stage, with the result that a shrinkage 
cavity or blowhole may appear at the centre. There 
are two ways to avoid the concentration of metal. 
One is to provide a cored opening in webs and ribs, 
as illustrated in Fig. 3.6. Alternatively, one can 
stagger the ribs and webs, as shown in Fig. 3.7.
Fig. 3.5
Fig. 3.6 Cored Holes
Fig. 3.7 Staggered Ribs
Avoid Very Thin Sections In general, if the 
thickness of a cast iron component is calculated 
from strength considerations, it is often too small. 
In such cases, the thickness should be increased to 
certain practical proportions. The minimum section 
thickness depends upon the process of casting, such 
as sand casting, permanent mould casting or die 
Manufacturing Considerations in Design 59
casting. The minimum thickness for a grey cast iron 
component is about 7 mm for parts up to 500 mm 
long, which gradually increases to 20 mm for large 
and heavy castings.
Shot Blast the Parts wherever Possible The shot 
blasting process improves the endurance limit of the 
component, particularly in case of thin sections.
Some ways to improve the strength of castings 
are illustrated in Figs 3.8 to 3.11. In Fig. 3.8, the 
inserted stud will not restore the strength of the 
original thickness. The wall adjacent to the drilled 
hole should have a thickness equivalent to the 
thickness of the main body. Figure 3.9 shows cored 
holes in webs or ribs. Oval-shaped holes are preferred 
with larger dimensions along the direction of forces. 
Patterns without a draft make a mould difﬁ cult and 
costly. A minimum draft of 3° should be provided, 
as illustrated in Fig. 3.10. Outside bosses should be 
omitted to facilitate a straight pattern draft as shown 
in Fig. 3.11.

3.3 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF 
FORGINGS
Forged components are widely used in automotive 
and aircraft industries. They are usually made 
of steels and non-ferrous metals. They can be as 
small as a gudgeon pin and as large as a crankshaft. 
Forged components are used under the following 
circumstances:
 
(i) Moving components requiring light weight 
to reduce inertia forces, e.g., connecting rod 
of IC engines.
 
(ii) Components subjected to excessive stresses, 
e.g., aircraft structures.
 (iii) Small components that must be supported by 
other structures or parts, e.g., hand tools and 
handles.
 (iv) Components requiring pressure tightness 
where the part must be free from internal 
cracks, e.g., valve bodies.
 
(v) Components whose failure would cause 
injury and expensive damage are forged for 
safety.
In order to obtain maximum beneﬁ t from forged 
components, the following principles should be 
adopted:
 
(i) While designing a forging, advantage should 
be taken of the direction of ﬁ bre lines. The 
grain structure of a crankshaft manufactured 
by the three principal methods, viz., 
60 Design of Machine Elements
casting, machining and forging, is shown in
Fig. 3.12. There are no ﬁ bre lines in the cast 
component and the grains are scattered. In 
case of a component prepared by machining 
methods, such as turning or milling, the 
original ﬁ bre lines of rolled stock are broken. 
It is only in case of forged parts that the ﬁ bre 
lines are arranged in a favourable way to 
withstand stresses due to external load. While 
designing a forging, the proﬁ le is selected 
in such a way that ﬁ bre lines are parallel to 
tensile forces and perpendicular to shear 
forces. Machining that cuts deep into the 
forging should be avoided, otherwise the ﬁ bre 
lines are broken and the part becomes weak.
Fig. 3.12 Grain Structure
 
(ii) The forged component should be provided 
with an adequate draft as illustrated in
Fig. 3.13. The draft angle is provided for 
an easy removal of the part from the die 
impressions. The angles a and b are drafts 
for outside and inside surfaces. As the 
material cools, it shrinks, and a gap is formed 
between the outer surface of the forging and 
the inner surfaces of the die cavity, with 
the result that the draft angle for the outer 
surface is small. On the other hand, when 
the material cools, its inner surfaces tend 
to shrink and grip the projecting surface of 
the die, with the result that the draft angle 
for the inner surface is large. For steels, the 
recommended values of a and b are  7°  and 
10° respectively.

Fig. 3.13 Draft for Forgings
 (iii) There are two important terms related to 
forgings, as illustrated in Fig. 3.14. The 
parting line is a plane in which the two 
halves of the forging dies meet and in which 
ﬂ ash is formed. A forging plane is a plane, 
which is perpendicular to the die motion. 
In most of the cases, the parting line and 
forging plane coincide, as illustrated in
Fig. 3.15. There are two basic principles 
for the location of the parting line—the 
parting line should be in one plane as far 
as possible and it should divide the forging 
into two equal parts. When the parting line 
is broken, as shown in Fig. 3.16, it results 
in unbalanced forging forces, which 
tend to displace the two die halves. Such 
forces are balanced either by a counter 
lock or by forging the two components 
simultaneously in a mirror-image position. 
A parting line that divides the forging into 
two halves ensures the minimum depth to 
which the steel must ﬂ ow to ﬁ ll the die 
impressions.

 (iv)  The forging should be provided with adequate 
ﬁ llet and corner radii. A small radius results 
in folds on the inner surface and cracks on the 
outer surface. A large radius is undesirable, 
particularly if the forged component is to be 
machined, during which the ﬁ bre lines are 
broken. Sharp corners result in increasing 
difﬁ culties in ﬁ lling the material, excessive 
forging forces, and poor die life. The 
magnitude of ﬁ llet radius depends upon the 
material, the size of forging and the depth 
of the die cavity. For moderate size steel 
forgings, the minimum corner radii are 1.5, 
2.5 and 3.5 mm for depths up to 10, 25 and 
50 mm respectively.
 
(v) Thin sections and ribs should be avoided in 
forged components. A thin section cools at 
a faster rate in the die cavity and requires 
excessive force for plastic deformation. It 
reduces the die life, and the removal of the 
component from the die cavities becomes 
difﬁ cult. For steel forgings, the recommended 
value of the minimum section thickness is
3 mm.
A properly designed forging is not only sound with 
regard to strength but it also helps reduce the forging 
forces, improves die life and simpliﬁ es die design. 
If the design is poor, the best of steel and forging 
methods will not give a satisfactory component.
3.4 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF 
MACHINED PARTS
Machined components are widely used in all 
industrial products. They are usually made from 
ferrous and non-ferrous metals. They are as small 
as a miniature gear in a wristwatch and as large as 
a huge turbine housing. Machined components are 
used under the following circumstances:
 
(i) Components requiring precision and high 
dimensional accuracy
 
(ii) Components requiring ﬂ atness, roundness, 
parallelism or circularity for their proper 
functioning
 (iii) Components of interchangeable assembly
 (iv) Components, which are in relative motion 
with each other or with some ﬁ xed part
The general principles for the design of machined 
parts are as follows: 
(i) 
Avoid 
Machining Machining 
operations 
increase cost of the component.  Components made 
by casting or forming methods are usually cheaper. 
Therefore, as far as possible, the designer should 
avoid machined surfaces.
(ii) Specify Liberal Tolerances The secondary 
machining operations like grinding or reaming are 
costly. Therefore, depending upon the functional 
62 Design of Machine Elements
requirement of the component, the designer should 
specify the most liberal dimensional and geometric 
tolerances. Closer the tolerance, higher is the cost.
(iii) Avoid Sharp Corners Sharp corners result in 
stress concentration. Therefore, the designer should 
avoid shapes that require sharp corners.
(iv) Use Stock Dimensions Raw material like 
bars are available in standard sizes. Using stock 
dimensions eliminates machining operations. For 
example, a hexagonal bar can be used for a bolt, and 
only the threaded portion can be machined. This will 
eliminate machining of hexagonal surfaces.
(v) Design Rigid Parts Any machining operation 
such as turning or shaping induces cutting forces on the 
components. The component should be rigid enough 
to withstand these forces. In this respect, components 
with thin walls or webs should be avoided.
(vi) Avoid Shoulders and Undercuts Shoulders and 
undercuts usually involve separate operations and 
separate tools, which increase the cost of machining.
(vii) Avoid Hard Materials Hard materials are 
difﬁ cult to machine. They should be avoided unless 
such properties are essential for the functional 
requirement of the product.
3.5 HOT AND COLD WORKING OF 
METALS
The temperature at which new stress-free grains are 
formed in the metal is called the recrystallization 
temperature. There are two types of metal 
deformation methods, namely, hot working and 
cold 
working. 
Metal 
deformation 
processes 
that are carried out above the recrystallization 
temperature are called hot working processes. Hot 
rolling, hot forging, hot spinning, hot extrusion, 
and hot drawing are hot working processes. Metal 
deformation processes that are carried out below 
the recrystallization temperature are called cold 
working processes. Cold rolling, cold forging, cold 
spinning, cold extrusion, and cold drawing are cold 
working processes. Hot working processes have the 
following advantages:
 
(i) Hot working reduces strain hardening.
 
(ii) Hot rolled components have higher toughness 
and ductility. They have better resistance to 
shocks and vibrations.
 (iii) Hot working increases the strength of metal 
by reﬁ ning the grain structure and aligning 
the grain of the metal with the ﬁ nal counters 
of the part. This is particularly true of forged 
parts.
 (iv) Hot working reduces residual stresses in the 
component.
Hot working processes have the following 
disadvantages:
 
(i) Hot working results in rapid oxidation of the 
surface due to high temperature.
 
(ii) Hot rolled components have poor surface 
ﬁ nish than cold rolled parts.
 (iii) Hot working requires expensive tools.
Cold working processes have the following 
advantages:
 
(i) Cold rolled components have higher hardness 
and strength.
 
(ii) Cold worked components have better surface 
ﬁ nish than hot rolled parts.
 (iii) The dimensions of cold rolled parts are very 
accurate.
 (iv) The tooling required for cold working is 
comparatively inexpensive. 
Cold working processes have the following 
disadvantages:
 
(i) Cold working reduces toughness and 
ductility. Such components have poor 
resistance to shocks and vibrations.
 
(ii) Cold working induces residual stresses in 
the component. Proper heat treatment is 
required to relieve these stresses.
3.6 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF 
WELDED ASSEMBLIES
Welding is the most important method of joining the 
parts into a complex assembly. Design of welded 
joints is explained in a separate chapter on welded 
joints. In this article, general principles in design of 
welded assemblies are discussed. The guidelines are 
as follows:
Manufacturing Considerations in Design 63
(i) Select the Material with High Weldability In 
general, a low carbon steel is more easily welded 
than a high carbon steel. Higher carbon content tends 
to harden the welded joint, as a result of which the 
weld is susceptible to cracks. For ease in welding, 
maximum carbon content is usually limited to 0.22 
per cent2.
(ii) Use Minimum Number of Welds Distortion is 
a serious problem in welded assemblies.  It creates 
difﬁ culties in maintaining correct shape, dimensions 
and tolerances of ﬁ nished assemblies.  A   metallic   
plate or component  does not distort, when it is 
heated or cooled as a total unit uniformly and it has 
freedom to expand or contract in all directions. In 
welding, however, only the adjoining area of the 
joint is heated up, which has no freedom to expand 
or contract. Uneven expansion and contraction 
in this adjoining area and parent metal results in 
distortion. When distortion is prevented by clamping 
ﬁ xtures, residual stresses are built up in the parts 
and annealing is required to relieve these stresses. 
Since distortion always occurs in welding, the 
design should involve a minimum number of welds 
and avoid over welding. It will not only reduce the 
distortion but also the cost.
(iii) Do not Shape the Parts Based on Casting or 
Forging In designing a welded assembly to replace 
a casting, it is incorrect to duplicate its appearance 
or shape by providing protrusions, brackets and 
housing. The designer should appreciate that 
welded assemblies are different from castings, 
having an appearance of their own. A correctly 
designed welded assembly is much lighter than 
the corresponding casting. It should reﬂ ect its 
lightweight characteristic, ﬂ exibility and economy 
of the material.
(iv) Use Standard Components The designer 
should specify standard sizes for plates, bars and 
rolled sections. Non-standard sections involve ﬂ ame 
cutting of plates and additional welding. Standard 
tubular sections should be used for torsional 
resistance. As far as possible, the designer should 
select plates of equal thickness for a butt joint.
(v) Avoid Straps, Laps and Stiffeners The stiffness 
of a plate can be increased by making bends, 
indentations in the form of ribs or corrugations by 
press working. If at all a stiffener is required to 
provide rigidity to the plate, it should be designed 
properly with minimum weight. Use of a separate 
stiffener involves additional welding increasing 
distortion and cost.
(vi) Select Proper Location for the Weld There are 
two aspects of selecting the correct location for a 
welded joint. The welded joint should be located in 
an area where stresses and deﬂ ection are not critical. 
Also, it should be located at such a place that the 
welder and welding machine has unobstructed 
access to that location. It should be possible to carry 
out pre-weld machining, post-weld heat treatment 
and ﬁ nally weld inspection at the location of the 
weld.
(vii) Prescribe Correct Sequence of Welding The 
designer should consider the sequence in which 
the parts should be welded together for minimum 
distortion. This is particularly important for a 
complex job involving a number of welds. An 
incorrect sequence of welding causes distortion and 
sometimes cracks in the weld metal due to stress 
concentration at some point in fabrication. A correct 
welding sequence distributes and balances the 
forces and stresses induced by weld contraction. For 
example, to prevent angular distortion in a double V 
butt joint, a sequence is recommended to lay welding 
runs alternatively on opposite sides of the joint.
Examples of ‘incorrect’ and ‘correct’ ways 
of welded design are illustrated from Fig. 3.17 
to Fig. 3.19. In Fig. 3.17(a), it is necessary to 
prepare bevel edges for the components prior to 
welding operation. This preparatory work can be 
totally eliminated by making a slight change in the 
arrangement of components, which is shown in Fig. 
3.17(b). Many times, fabrication is carried out by 
cutting steel plates followed by welding. The aim 
 2 IS 1871–1965: Commentary on Indian Standard wrought steels for general engineering purposes.
64 Design of Machine Elements
of the designer is to minimise scrap in such process. 
This is illustrated in Fig. 3.18. The circular top 
plate and annular bottom plate are cut from two 
separate plates resulting in excess scrap as shown in 
Fig. 3.18(a). Making a slight change in design, the 
top plate and annual bottom plate can be cut from 
one plate reducing scrap and material cost, which 
is shown in Fig. 3.18(b). Accumulation of welded 
joints results in shrinkage stresses. A method to 
reduce this accumulation is illustrated in Fig. 3.19.

3.7 DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURE AND 
ASSEMBLY (DFMA)
The design effort makes up only about 5% of the total 
cost of a product. However, it usually determines 
more than 70% of the manufacturing cost of the 
product. Therefore, at best only 30% of the product’s 
cost can be changed once the design is ﬁ nalised and 
drawings are prepared. Using statistical process 
control or improving manufacturing methods during 
production stage after the design has been ﬁ nalised 
has marginal or little effect on the product’s cost. The 
best strategy to lower product cost is to recognise 
the importance of manufacturing early in the design 
stage. Design for manufacture and assembly are 
simple guidelines formulated by Bart Huthwaite, 
Director of Institute for Competitive Design, 
Rochester, USA3. These guidelines, although simple, 
are used to simplify design, decrease assembly cost, 
improve product reliability and reduce operation 
time required to bring a new product into the market. 
Little technology is required to implement these 
guidelines. The guidelines are as follows:
(i) Reduce the Parts Count Design engineers 
should try for a product design that uses a minimum 
number of parts. Fewer parts result in lower costs. 
It also makes the assembly simpler and less prone 
to defects.
(ii) Use Modular Designs Modular design reduces 
the number of parts being assembled at any one time 
and also simpliﬁ es ﬁ nal assembly. Field service 
becomes simple, fast and cheap because dismantling 
is faster and requires fewer tools.
(iii) Optimize Part Handling Parts should be 
designed so that they do not become tangled, 
struck together or require special handling prior to 
assembly. Flexible parts such as those with wires or 
cables should be avoided   because they   complicate  
automated assembly. Whenever possible, parts 
should retain the same orientation from the point of 
manufacture to assembly.
 3 Bart Huthwaite—Checklist for DFM—Machine Design—February 8, 1990—vol. 8, no. 3.
Manufacturing Considerations in Design 65
(iv)  Assemble in the Open Assembly operation 
should be carried out in clear view. This is important 
for manual assembly. It also decreases the chances of 
manufacturing defects slipping past the inspector.
(v) Do not Fight Gravity Design products so that 
they can be assembled from the bottom to top along 
the vertical axis. This allows simple robots and 
insertion tools because gravity is used to assist the 
assembly process. On the other hand, expensive 
clamping ﬁ xtures are required for assembly along 
horizontal axes.
(vi) Design for Part Identity For both manual and 
automated assembly, symmetric parts are easier 
to handle and orient. As assembly rate increases, 
symmetry becomes more important. Features 
should be added to enhance symmetry. Asymmetric 
parts should be designed so that their other surfaces 
make them easily identiﬁ able. Asymmetry can be 
added or exaggerated to force correct alignment and 
orientation and make mistakes impossible.
(vii) Eliminate Fasteners Fasteners are a major 
obstacle to efﬁ cient assembly and should be avoided 
wherever possible. They are difﬁ cult to handle and 
can cause jamming, if defective. In manual assembly, 
the cost of driving a screw can be six to ten times the 
cost of the screw itself.  If the use of fasteners cannot 
be avoided, limit the number of different types of 
fasteners used.
(viii) Design Parts for Simple Assembly  Assembling 
parts can be a major challenge in automated 
operations. Misalignment is a serious problem when 
parts from different vendors are put together. Part 
compliance is the ability of one part to move so that 
it is seated properly with another. The product should 
be designed for part compliance. Features such as 
added chamfers on both parts and adequate guiding 
surfaces make assembly faster and more reliable.
(ix) Reduce, Simplify and Optimise Manufactu-
ring Process The number of processes needed to 
assemble a product should be kept to a minimum. 
Processes that are difﬁ cult to control, such as 
welding or brazing, should be avoided.
3.8 TOLERANCES
Due to the inaccuracy of manufacturing methods, it 
is not possible to machine a component to a given 
dimension. The components are so manufactured that 
their dimensions lie between two limits—maximum 
and minimum. The basic dimension is called the 
normal or basic size, while the difference between 
the two limits is called permissible tolerance. 
Tolerance is deﬁ ned as permissible variation in the 
dimensions of the component. The two limits are 
sometimes called the upper and lower deviations. 
These deﬁ nitions are illustrated in Fig. 3.20, with 
reference to shaft and hole in clearance ﬁ t.

66 Design of Machine Elements
There are two systems of speciﬁ cation for 
tolerances, namely, unilateral and bilateral. In the 
unilateral system, one tolerance is zero, while the 
other takes care of all permissible variation in basic 
size. For example,
100
100
0 04
0 00
0 00
0 04
+
+
+
-
.
.
.
.
or
In case of bilateral tolerances, the variations 
are given in both directions from normal size. The 
upper limit in this case is the basic size plus non-zero 
positive tolerance, and the lower limit is the basic size 
plus non-zero negative tolerance. For example,
25
25
0 4
0 4
0 2
±
+
-
.
.
.
or
In bilateral tolerances, the two tolerances are 
often equal, but this  is not a necessary condition. 
Unilateral tolerances are used for shafts and holes.
3.9 TYPES OF FITS
When two parts are to be assembled, the relationship 
resulting from the difference between their sizes before 
assembly is called a ﬁ t. Depending upon the limits 
of the shaft and the hole, ﬁ ts are broadly classiﬁ ed 
into three groups—clearance ﬁ t, transition ﬁ t and 
interference ﬁ t. Clearance ﬁ t is a ﬁ t which always 
provides a positive clearance between the hole and 
the shaft over the entire range of tolerances. In this 
case, the tolerance zone of the hole is entirely above 
that of the shaft. Interference ﬁ t is a ﬁ t which always 
provides a positive interference over the whole range 
of tolerances. In this case, the tolerance zone of the 
hole is completely below that of the shaft. Transition 
ﬁ t is a ﬁ t which may provide either a clearance or 
interference, depending upon the actual values of the 
individual tolerances of the mating components. In 
this case, the tolerance zones of the hole and the shaft 
overlap. These deﬁ nitions are illustrated in Fig. 3.21.
Fig. 3.21 Types of Fits: (a) Clearance Fit
 
(b) Transition Fit (c) Interference Fit
There are two basic systems for giving tolerances 
to the shaft and the hole, namely, the hole-basis 
system and the shaft-basis, system. In the hole-basis 
system, the different clearances and interferences 
are obtained by associating various shafts with 
a single hole, whose lower deviation is zero. The 
system is illustrated in Fig. 3.22. In this case, the 
size of the hole is the basic size, and the clearance or 
interference is applied to the shaft dimension. The 
system is denoted by the symbol ‘H’. This system 
has an advantage over the shaft-basis system, 
because holes are machined by standard drills or 
reamers having ﬁ xed dimensions, while the shafts 
can be turned or ground to any given dimension. 
Due to this reason, the hole-basis system is widely 
used.
Fig. 3.22 Hole Basis System: (a) Clearance Fit
 
(b) Transition Fit (c) Interference Fit
In the shaft-basis system, the different clearances 
or interferences are obtained by associating various 
holes with a single shaft, whose upper deviation is 
zero. This principle is illustrated in Fig. 3.23. In 
this system, the size of the shaft is the basic size, 
while the clearance or interference is applied to the 
dimensions of the hole. The system is denoted by 
the symbol ‘h’. The shaft-basis system is popular in 
industries using semi-ﬁ nished or ﬁ nished shafting, 
such as bright bars, as raw material.

3.10 BIS SYSTEM OF FITS AND 
TOLERANCES
According to a system recommended by the Bureau 
of Indian Standards,4, 5, 6 tolerance is speciﬁ ed by
an alphabet, capital or small, followed by a number, 
e.g., H7 or g6. The description of tolerance consists 
of two parts—fundamental deviation and magnitude 
of tolerance, as shown in Fig. 3.24. The fundamental 
deviation gives the location of the tolerance zone 
with respect to the zero line. It is indicated by an 
alphabet—capital letters for holes and small letters
Zero Line
Fundamental
Deviation
Magnitude of
Tolerance
Fig. 3.24 Description of Tolerance
for shafts. The magnitude of tolerance is designated 
by a number, called the grade. The grade of tolerance 
is deﬁ ned as a group of tolerances, which are 
considered to have the same level of accuracy for all 
basic sizes. There are eighteen grades of tolerances 
with designations IT1, IT2, …, IT17, and IT18. 
The letters of symbol IT stand for ‘International 
Tolerance’ grade. The tolerance for a shaft of 
50 mm diameter as the basic size, with the 
fundamental deviation denoted by the letter ‘g’ and 
the tolerance of grade 7 is written as 50g7. 
The ﬁ t is indicated by the basic size common to 
both components followed by symbols for tolerance 
of each component. For example,
50 H8/g7  or  50 H8-g7  or 
50
8
7
H
g
The formulae for calculating the fundamental 
deviation and magnitude of tolerance of various 
grades are given in the standards. However, the 
designer is mainly concerned with readymade
tables for determining tolerances. Table 3.2 
and Tables 3.3a and 3.3b give tolerances for
holes and shafts up to 100-mm size. For other
sizes and grades, one can refer to relevant 
standards.

 5 IS 2709—1964: Guide for selection of ﬁ ts.

Manufacturing Considerations in Design 69
3.11 SELECTION OF FITS
The guidelines for the selection of clearance ﬁ ts are 
as follows:
 
(i) The ﬁ ts H7-d8, H8-d9 and H11-d11 are loose 
running ﬁ ts, and are used for plumber-block 
bearings and loose pulleys.
 
(ii) The ﬁ ts H6-e7, H7-e8 and H8-e8 are loose 
clearance ﬁ ts, and are used for properly 
lubricated bearings, requiring appreciable 
clearances. The ﬁ ner grades are used for 
heavy-duty, high-speed bearings and large 
electric motors.
 (iii) The ﬁ ts H6-f6, H7-f7 and H8-f8 are normal 
running ﬁ ts, widely used for grease or oil 
lubricated bearings having low temperature 
rise. They are also used for shafts of 
gearboxes, small electric motors and 
pumps. 
 (iv) The ﬁ ts H6-g5, H7-g6 and H8-g7 are
expensive from manufacturing considera-
tions. They are used in precision equipment, 
pistons, slide valves and bearings of accurate 
link mechanisms.
The typical types of transition ﬁ ts are H6-j5, 
H7-j6 and H8-j7. They are used in applications 
where slight interference is permissible. Some of 
their applications are spigot and recess of the rigid 
coupling and the composite gear blank, where a 
steel rim is ﬁ tted on an ordinary steel hub.
The general guidelines for the selection of 
interference ﬁ ts are as follows:
 
(i) The ﬁ t H7-p6 or H7-p7 results in interference, 
which is not excessive but sufﬁ cient to give 
non-ferrous parts a light press ﬁ t. Such 
parts can be dismantled easily as and when 
required, e.g., ﬁ tting a brass bush in the 
gear.
 
(ii) The ﬁ t H6-r5 or H7-r6 is a medium drive 
ﬁ t on ferrous parts, which can be easily 
dismantled.
 (iii) The ﬁ ts H6-s5, H7-s6 and H8-s7 are used for 
permanent and semi-permanent assemblies 
of steel and cast iron parts. The amount 
of interference in these ﬁ ts is sufﬁ ciently 
large to provide a considerable gripping 
force. They are used in valve seats and shaft 
collars.
The selection of interference ﬁ t depends upon 
a number of factors, such as materials, diameters, 
surface ﬁ nish and machining methods. It is 
necessary to calculate the maximum and minimum 
interference in each case. The torque transmitting 
capacity is calculated for minimum interference, 
while the force required to assemble the parts is 
decided by the maximum value of interference.
3.12 TOLERANCES AND 
MANUFACTURING METHODS
The speciﬁ cation of machining method for a given 
component depends upon the grade of tolerances 
speciﬁ ed by the designer. The approximate 
relationship between the grade of tolerance and 
the manufacturing method with desirable accuracy 
under normal working conditions, is as follows:
Grade 16 Sand casting–ﬂ ame cutting
Grade 15 Stamping
Grade 14 Die casting–moulding
Grade 11 Drilling–rough turning–boring
Grade 10 Milling–slotting–planning–rolling–
extrusion
Grade 9 
Horizontal and vertical boring–turning 
on automatic lathes
Grade 8 
Turning, boring and reaming on centre, 
capstan and turret lathes
Grade 7 
High 
precision 
turning–broaching–
honing
Grade 6 
Grinding–ﬁ ne honing
Grade 5 
Lapping–ﬁ ne grinding–diamond boring
Grade 4 
Lapping
In this chapter, the hole-basis system is discussed. 
The manufacturing processes for obtaining different 
grades of tolerances for holes are as follows:
H5 Precision boring–ﬁ ne internal grinding–honing
H6 Precision boring–honing–hand reaming
H7 Grinding–broaching–precision reaming
H8 Boring–machine reaming
Finer grades of tolerances result in costly 
manufacturing methods. They are to be speciﬁ ed 
only on grounds of functional requirement. Coarse 
70 Design of Machine Elements
grades of tolerances reduce the cost of production. 
The designer should always take into consideration 
the available manufacturing facilities and their cost 
competitiveness before specifying the grade of 
tolerances.
Example 3.1 The main bearing of an engine is 
shown in Fig. 3.25. Calculate
 
(i) the maximum and minimum diameters of the 
bush and crank pin; and
 
(ii) the maximum and minimum clearances 
between the crank pin and bush.
Suggest suitable machining methods for both.

Step III Machining methods
The bush (H6) is usually  machined by precision 
boring, honing or hand reaming methods. The crank 
pin (e7) is machined by high precision turning or 
broaching.

housing of a pump is shown in Fig. 3.26. Calculate
 
(i) the maximum and minimum diameters of the

3.13 SELECTIVE ASSEMBLY
The selective assembly is a process of sorting the 
manufactured components into different groups 
according to their sizes, and then assembling the 
components of one group to the corresponding 
components of a matching group. In this method, 
larger shafts are assembled with larger holes and 
Manufacturing Considerations in Design 71
smaller shafts with smaller holes. This results in 
closer clearance or interference without involving 
costly machining methods.
As an example, a hydrodynamic journal bearing 
with a recommended class of ﬁ t 50 H8-d8 is 
considered. From Tables 3.2 and 3.3a, the limiting 
dimensions are as follows:
Bearing:
50
50 039
50 000

0 000

.
.
.
or
mm
Maximum clearance = 50.039 – 49.881 = 0.158 mm
Minimum clearance = 50.000 – 49.920 = 0.080 mm  
The range of clearance is from 0.080 to 0.158 
mm. Suppose it is desired to hold the clearance 
in a narrow range from 0.100 to 0.140 mm. Then 
the bearings and the journals are divided into two 
groups with the following limiting dimensions: 
 
Bearings
Journals
Group A 
50 039
50 020
.
.
49 920
49 900
.
.
Group B 
50 020
50 000
.
.
49 900
49 881
.
.
Group A
Maximum clearance = 50.039 – 49.900 = 0.139 mm
Minimum clearance = 50.020 – 49.920 = 0.100 mm
Group B
Maximum clearance = 50.020 – 49.881 = 0.139 mm
Minimum clearance = 50.000 – 49.900 = 0.100 mm
It is seen that both groups have clearance in the 
range 0.100 to 0.139 mm.
In the above example, only two groups are 
considered. When the parts are sorted into more 
number of groups, the range of clearance is further 
reduced. Selective assembly results in ﬁ ner clearance 
or interference, even with large manufacturing 
tolerances. The main drawbacks of this method are 
as follows:
 
(i) Hundred per cent inspection is required for 
components and there is additional operation 
of sorting the components.
 
(ii) Interchangeability is affected and servicing 
or replacement of worn-out components 
becomes difﬁ cult.
 (iii) The method can be used only when a large 
number of components are manufactured, 
otherwise some groups may not contain 
sufﬁ cient number of components.
Selective assembly is particularly useful in case 
of interference ﬁ ts where a tight control over the 
range of interference is essential to avoid loosening 
of mating components.
Example 3.3 The recommended class of ﬁ t for 
the hub shrunk on a shaft is 50H7-s6. However, it 
is necessary to limit the interference from 0.030 to 
0.050 mm between the hub and the shaft. Specify the 
groups for selective assembly.

3.14 TOLERANCES FOR BOLT SPACING
When two or more components are assembled 
by means of bolts, it is often required to specify 
tolerances for the centre to centre distance between 
bolts. As shown in Fig. 3.27, two plates A and B 
are assembled by bolts with a centre distance of
(a ± x). Consider the worst geometric situation, 
when the following conditions exist:
 
(i) The holes are of the smallest size, Dmin,
 
(ii) The bolts are of the largest size, dmax,
 (iii) The plate A has a minimum spacing (a – x), 
and
 (iv) The plate B has maximum spacing (a + x).

Manufacturing Considerations in Design 73
3.15  SURFACE ROUGHNESS
The surface roughness or surface ﬁ nish plays an 
important role in the performance of certain machine 
elements. Some of the examples are as follows:
 
(i) Friction and wear increases with surface 
roughness, adversely affecting the perfor-
mance of bearings.
 
(ii) Rough surfaces have a reduced contact 
area in interference ﬁ ts, which reduces the 
holding capacity of the joints.
 (iii) The endurance strength of the component is 
greatly reduced due to poor surface ﬁ nish.
 (iv) The corrosion resistance is adversely affected 
by poor surface ﬁ nish.
It is necessary for the designer to specify an 
optimum surface ﬁ nish from the considerations of 
functional requirement and the cost of manufacture. 
A magniﬁ ed proﬁ le of the surface is shown in
Fig. 3.28. There are two methods to specify surface 
roughness – cla value and rms value.

Design against
Static Load
Chapter 4
4.1 MODES OF FAILURE
A static load is deﬁ ned as a force, which is 
gradually applied to a mechanical component and 
which does not change its magnitude or direction 
with respect to time. It was discussed in Chapter 2 
that engineering materials are classiﬁ ed into two 
groups—ductile and brittle materials. A ductile 
material is one which has a relatively large tensile 
strain before fracture takes place. On the other 
hand, a brittle material has a relatively small 
tensile strain before fracture. A tensile strain of 
5% is considered to be the dividing line between 
brittle and ductile materials. Structural steels and 
aluminium are ductile materials, while cast iron is 
an example of a brittle material. 
A mechanical component may fail, that is, may 
be unable to perform its function satisfactorily, as 
a result of any one of the following three modes of 
failure1: 
 
(i) failure by elastic deﬂ ection;
 (ii) failure by general yielding; and 
 (iii) failure by fracture. 
In applications like transmission shaft supporting 
gears, the maximum force acting on the shaft, 
without affecting its performance, is limited by the 
permissible elastic deﬂ ection. Lateral or torsional 
rigidity is considered as the criterion of design 
 1 FB Seely and JO Smith, Advanced Mechanics of Materials, John Wiley and Sons. Inc.
in such cases. Sometimes, the elastic deﬂ ection 
results in unstable conditions, such as buckling 
of columns or vibrations. The design of the 
mechanical component, in all these cases, is based 
on the permissible lateral or torsional deﬂ ection. 
The stresses induced in the component are not 
signiﬁ cant and the properties of the material, such 
as yield strength or ultimate tensile strength, are not 
of primary importance. The modules of elasticity 
and rigidity are the important properties and the 
dimensions of the component are determined by the 
load-deﬂ ection equations.
A mechanical component made of ductile 
material loses its engineering usefulness due to a 
large amount of plastic deformation after the yield 
point stress is reached. Considerable portion of 
the component is subjected to plastic deformation, 
called general yielding. There is a basic difference 
between general yielding and localized yielding. 
The localized yielding in the region of stress 
concentration is restricted to a very small portion 
of the component and is not considered signiﬁ cant. 
The yield strength of a material is an important 
property when a component is designed against 
failure due to general yielding. 
Components made of brittle material cease 
to function satisfactorily because of the sudden 
fracture without any plastic deformation. The 
Design against Static Load 77
failure in this case is sudden and total. In such 
cases, ultimate tensile strength of the material is an 
important property to determine the dimensions of 
these components. 
The failure by elastic deﬂ ection is separately 
considered in the chapter on transmission shafting. 
The discussion in this chapter is restricted to the 
design of components on the strength basis.
4.2 FACTOR OF SAFETY 
While designing a component, it is necessary to 
provide sufﬁ cient reserve strength in case of an 
accident. This is achieved by taking a suitable 
factor of safety (fs).
The factor of safety is deﬁ ned as
(
)
fs =
failure stress
allowable stress
or 
( ) = failure load
working load
fs
The allowable stress is the stress value, which 
is used in design to determine the dimensions of 
the component. It is considered as a stress, which 
the designer expects will not be exceeded under 
normal operating conditions. For ductile materials, 
the allowable stress s is obtained by the following 
relationship:
 
s =
S
fs
yt
(
)  
(4.1)
For brittle materials, the relationship is, 
 
s = S
fs
ut
(
)  
(4.2)
where Syt and Sut are the yield strength and 
the ultimate tensile strength of the material 
respectively.
There are a number of factors which are difﬁ cult 
to evaluate accurately in design analysis. Some of 
the factors are as follows:
 
(i) Uncertainty in the magnitude of external 
force acting on the component
 (ii) Variations in the properties of materials like 
yield strength or ultimate strength
 (iii) Variations 
in 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
component due to imperfect workmanship
In addition to these factors, the number of 
assumptions made in design analysis, in order 
to simplify the calculations, may not be exactly 
valid in working conditions. The factor of safety 
ensures against these uncertainties and unknown 
conditions.
The magnitude of factor of safety depends upon 
the following factors:
(i) Effect of Failure Sometimes, the failure 
of a machine element involves only a little 
inconvenience or loss of time, e.g., failure of the 
ball bearing in a gearbox. On the other hand, in 
some cases, there is substantial ﬁ nancial loss or 
danger to the human life, e.g., failure of the valve 
in a pressure vessel. The factor of safety is high in 
applications where failure of a machine part may 
result in serious accidents.
(ii) Type of Load The factor of safety is low when 
the external force acting on the machine element is 
static, i.e., a load which does not vary in magnitude 
or direction with respect to time. On the other 
hand, a higher factor of safety is selected when 
the machine element is subjected to impact load. 
This is due to the fact that impact load is suddenly 
applied to the machine component, usually at high 
velocities.
(iii) Degree of Accuracy in Force Analysis When 
the forces acting on the machine component are 
precisely determined, a low factor of safety can 
be selected. On the contrary, a higher factor of 
safety is necessary when the machine component is 
subjected to a force whose magnitude or direction 
is uncertain and unpredictable.
(iv) Material of Component When the component 
is made of a homogeneous ductile material like 
steel, yield strength is the criterion of failure. The 
factor of safety is usually small in such cases. On 
the other hand, a cast iron component has non-
homogeneous structure and a higher factor of safety 
based on ultimate tensile strength is chosen.
(v) Reliability 
of 
Component In 
certain 
applications like continuous process equipment, 
power stations or defense equipment, high 
78 Design of Machine Elements
reliability of components is expected. The factor of 
safety increases with increasing reliability. 
(vi) Cost of Component As the factor of safety 
increases, dimensions of the component, material 
requirement and cost increase. The factor of safety 
is low for cheap machine parts.
(vii) Testing of Machine Element A low factor of 
safety can be chosen when the machine component 
can be tested under actual conditions of service and 
operation. A higher factor of safety is necessary, 
when it is not possible to test the machine part or 
where there is deviation between test conditions 
and actual service conditions.
(viii) Service Conditions When the machine 
element is likely to operate in corrosive atmosphere 
or high temperature environment, a higher factor of 
safety is necessary.
(ix) Quality of Manufacture When the quality of 
manufacture is high, variations in dimensions of 
the machine component are less and a low factor 
of safety can be selected. Conversely, a higher 
factor of safety is required to compensate for poor 
manufacturing quality.
The selection of magnitude of the factor of safety 
is one of the difﬁ cult tasks faced by the designer. 
The guidelines for selection of quantitative values 
of the factor of safety are as follows:
 
(i)  For cast iron components, ultimate tensile 
strength is considered to be the failure 
criterion. Failure occurs when the maximum 
stress in the component due to external 
force exceeds the ultimate tensile strength 
even once. Cast iron components have a 
non-homogeneous structure. Many times, 
there are residual stresses in the component. 
To account for these factors, a large factor 
of safety, usually 3 to 5, based on ultimate 
tensile strength, is used in the design of cast 
iron components.
 (ii)  For components made of ductile materials 
like steel and which are subjected to external 
static forces, yield strength is considered 
to be the criterion of failure. When such 
components are overloaded and the stress 
due to external force exceeds the yield 
strength of the material, there is a small 
amount of plastic deformation, which usually 
does not put the component out of service. 
Ductile components have a homogeneous 
structure and the residual stresses can be 
relieved by proper heat treatment. The stress 
analysis is more precise in case of static 
forces. Due to these reasons, the factor of 
safety is usually small in such cases. The 
recommended factor of safety is 1.5 to 2, 
based on the yield strength of the material.
 (iii)  For components made of ductile materials 
and those subjected to external ﬂ uctuating 
forces, endurance limit is considered to be 
the criterion of failure. Such components fail 
on account of fatigue. Fatigue failure depends 
upon the amplitude of ﬂ uctuating stresses 
and the number of stress cycles. The nature 
of fatigue failure is discussed in Section 
5.5. The number of factors affect endurance 
limit, such as stress concentration, notch 
sensitivity, surface ﬁ nish and even the size 
of the component. Therefore, the endurance 
limit of the component is reduced to account 
for these factors. The recommended factor 
of safety based on this endurance limit of 
component is usually 1.3 to 1.5.
 (iv)  The design of certain components such as 
cams and followers, gears, rolling contact 
bearings or rail and wheel is based on 
the calculation of contact stresses by the 
Hertz’ theory. Failure of such components 
is usually in the form of small pits on the 
surface of the component. Pitting is surface 
fatigue failure, which occurs when contact 
stress exceeds the surface endurance limit. 
The damage due to pitting is local and does 
not put the component out of operation. The 
surface endurance limit can be improved 
by increasing the surface hardness. The 
recommended factor of safety for such 
components is 1.8 to 2.5 based on surface 
endurance limit.
 (v)  Certain components, such as piston rods, 
power screws or studs, are designed on the 
Design against Static Load 79
basis of buckling consideration. Buckling is 
elastic instability, which results in a sudden 
large lateral deﬂ ection. The critical buckling 
load depends upon yield strength, modulus 
of elasticity, end conditions and radius of 
gyration of the column. The recommended 
factor of safety is 3 to 6 based on the critical 
buckling load of such components.
The above-mentioned values of the factor of 
safety are based on past experience. They are 
applicable under normal circumstances. However, 
a higher factor of safety is chosen under the 
following conditions: 
 
(i) The magnitude and nature of external forces 
acting on the machine component cannot be 
precisely estimated.
 (ii) It is likely that the material of the machine 
component has a non-homogeneous structure.
 (iii) The machine component is subjected to 
impact force in service.
 (iv) There is possibility of residual stresses in the 
machine component.
 (v) The machine component is working in a 
corrosive atmosphere.
 (vi) The machine part is subjected to high 
temperatures during operation.
 (vii) The failure of the machine part may hazard 
the lives of people (hoist, lifting machinery 
and boilers) and substantial loss to property.
 (viii) It is not possible to test the machine 
component under actual conditions of service 
and there is variation in actual conditions 
and standard test conditions.
 (ix) Higher 
reliability 
is 
demanded 
in 
applications like components of aircrafts.
 (x)  There is possibility of abnormal variation in 
external load on some occasions.
 (xi) The quality of manufacture of the machine 
part is poor.
 (xii) The exact mode of failure of the component 
is unpredictable.
 (xiii) There is stress concentration in a machine 
component.
A higher factor of safety increases the 
reliability of the component. However, it increases 
the dimensions, the volume of material and 
consequently the cost of the machine component. 
In recent years, attempts have been made to obtain 
precise values of factor of the safety based on 
statistical considerations and reliability analysis.
4.3 STRESS–STRAIN RELATIONSHIP
When a mechanical component is subjected to 
an external static force, a resisting force is set up 
within the component. The internal resisting force 
per unit area of the component is called stress. 
The stresses are called tensile when the ﬁ bres of 
the component tend to elongate due to the external 
force. On the other hand, when the ﬁ bres tend to 
shorten due to the external force, the stresses are 
called compressive stresses. A tension rod subjected 
to an external force P is shown in Fig. 4.1. The 
tensile stress is given by,
 
st
P
A
=
 
(4.3)
where
 
st = tensile stress (N/mm2)
 
P = external force (N)
 
A = cross-sectional area (mm2)
Fig. 4.1 Tensile Stress
Many times, the unit for stress or strength is 
taken as MPa.
1 MPa = 1 mega Pascal = 106 Pascal

Therefore, two units (N/mm2) and (MPa) 
are same. In this book, the unit (N/mm2) is used. 
However, it can be replaced by (MPa) without any 
conversion factor.
The strain is deformation per unit length. It 
given by
 
e = d
l  
(4.4)
where,
 
e = strain (mm/mm)
 
d = elongation of the tension rod (mm)
 
l = original length of the rod (mm)
According to Hooke’s law, the stress is directly 
proportional to the strain within elastic limit. 
Therefore,
 
st a e
or  
st = E e 
(4.5)
where E is the constant of proportionality known 
as Young’s modulus or modulus of elasticity (in
N/mm2 or MPa). 
For carbon steels,

The following assumptions are made in the 
analysis of stress and strain:
 
(i)  The material is homogeneous.
 (ii)  The load is gradually applied.
 (iii)  The line of action of force P passes through 
the geometric axis of the cross-section. 
 (iv) The cross-section is uniform.
 (v) There is no stress concentration.
4.4 SHEAR STRESS AND SHEAR STRAIN
When the external force acting on a component 
tends to slide the adjacent planes with respect to 
each other, the resulting stresses on these planes are 
called direct shear stresses. Two plates held together 
by means of a rivet are shown in Fig. 4.3 (a). The 
average shear stress in the rivet is given by
 
t = P
A  
(4.8)
where,
t = shear stress (N/mm2 or MPa) 
A = cross-sectional area of the rivet (mm2)
Fig. 4.3 (a) Riveted Joint (b) Shear Deformation
(c) Shear Stress
A plane rectangular element, cut from the 
component and subjected to shear force, is shown 
in Fig. 4.4(a). Shear stresses cause a distortion in 
the original right angles. The shear strain (g) is 
deﬁ ned as the change in the right angle of a shear 
element. Within the elastic limit, the stress–strain 
relationship is given by
 
t = Gg 
(4.9)
Design against Static Load 81
where,
g  = shear strain (radians)
G is the constant of proportionality known as 
shear modulus or modulus of rigidity (in N/mm2 or 
MPa).

(b) Shear Strain
For carbon steels,  
G = 80 000 N/mm2 
For grey cast iron,  
G = 40 000 N/mm2 
The relationship between the modulus of 
elasticity, the modulus of rigidity and the Poisson’s 
ratio is given by,
 
E = 2G (1 + m ) 
(4.10)
where m is Poisson’s ratio. Poisson’s ratio is the 
ratio of strain in the lateral direction to that in the 
axial direction.

(
)  
(4.11)
where, 
Ssy = yield strength in shear (N/mm2 or MPa)
It will be proved at a later stage that the yield 
strength in shear is 50% of the yield strength in 
tension, according to the principal shear stress 
theory of failure.
4.5 STRESSES DUE TO BENDING 
MOMENT
A straight beam subjected to a bending moment Mb 
is shown in Fig. 4.5(a). The beam is subjected to 
a combination of tensile stress on one side of the 
neutral axis and compressive stress on the other. 
Such a stress distribution can be visualized by 
bending a thick leather belt. Cracks will appear on 
the outer surface, while folds will appear on the 
inside. Therefore, the outside ﬁ bres are in tension, 
while the inside ﬁ bres are in compression. The 
bending stress at any ﬁ bre is given by,
 
sb
b
M
y
I
=
 
(4.12)
where,
sb = bending stress at a distance of y from the  
 
neutral axis (N/mm2 or MPa)
Mb = applied bending moment (N-mm)
 I = moment of inertia of the cross-section about
  
the neutral axis (mm4) 
The bending stress is maximum in a ﬁ bre, which 
is farthest from the neutral axis. The distribution of 
stresses is linear and the stress is proportional to the 
distance from the neutral axis.

82 Design of Machine Elements
Equation (4.12) is based on the following 
assumptions:
 
(i) The beam is straight with uniform cross-
section.
 (ii)  The forces acting on the beam lie in a plane 
perpendicular to the axis of the beam.
 (iii)  The material is homogeneous, isotropic and 
obeys Hooke’s law. 
 (iv)  Plane cross-sections remain plane after 
bending.
The moment of inertia in Eq. (4.12) is the area 
moment of inertia.
For a rectangular cross-section,

axis (mm)
For a circular cross-section,
 
I
d
= p

64  
(4.14)
where d is the diameter of the cross-section.
When the cross-section is irregular, as shown in 
Fig. 4.6, the moment of inertia about the centroidal 
axis Xg is given by, 
 
Ixg = Ú y2 dA 
(4.15)
Fig. 4.6 Parallel-axis Theorem
The parallel-axis theorem for this area is given 
by the expression,
 
Ix1 = Ixg + Ay1
2  
(4.16)
where,
 Ix1 = moment of inertia of the area about X1 axis, 
which is parallel to the axis Xg, and located 
at a distance y1 from Xg
 Ixg = moment of inertia of the area about its own 
centroidal axis
 
A = area of the cross-section.
In design of machine elements like transmission 
shaft, axle or lever, it is required to ﬁ nd out the 
maximum bending moment by constructing the 
bending moment diagram. There is a particular sign 
convention for bending moment diagram, which 
is illustrated in Fig. 4.7. For positive bending, the 
Fig. 4.7 Sign Convention for Bending Moment
bending moment diagram is constructed on the 
positive side of the Y-axis. For negative bending, 
the diagram is on the negative side of the Y-
axis. There is a simple way to remember positive 
bending. Imagine the crescent shaped moon—it is 
positive bending.
4.6 STRESSES DUE TO TORSIONAL 
MOMENT
A transmission shaft, subjected to an external 
torque, is shown in Fig. 4.8 (a). The internal 
stresses, which are induced to resist the action

of twist, are called torsional shear stresses. The 
torsional shear stress is given by
 
t = M
r
J
t
 
(4.17)
where, 
 
t = torsional shear stress at the ﬁ bre (N/mm2
or MPa)
 Mt = applied torque (N-mm)
 
r = radial distance of the ﬁ bre from the axis of 
rotation (mm)
 
J = polar moment of inertia of the cross-section 
about the axis of rotation (mm4) 
Fig. 4.8 (a) Shaft Subjected to Torsional Moment 
(b) Distribution of Torsional Shear Stresses
The distribution of torsional shear stresses is shown 
in Fig. 4.8 (b). The stress is maximum at the outer 
ﬁ bre and zero at the axis of rotation. The angle of 
twist is given by
 
q = M l
JG
t  
(4.18)
where,
q = angle of twist (radians)
l = length of the shaft (mm)
Equations (4.17) and (4.18) are based on the 
following assumptions:
 
(i)  The shaft is straight with a circular cross-
section.
 (ii)  A plane transverse section remains plane 
after twisting.
 (iii)  The material is homogeneous, isotropic and 
obeys Hooke’s law.
The polar moment of inertia of a solid circular 
shaft of diameter d is given by

4.7 ECCENTRIC AXIAL LOADING
In Section 4.3, it was assumed that the line of 
action of force passes through the centroid of 
the cross-section. There are certain mechanical 
components subjected to an external force, tensile 
or compressive, which does not pass through the 
centroid of the cross-section. A typical example 
of such an eccentric loading is shown in Fig. 
4.9(a). According to the principle of statics, the 
eccentric force P can be replaced by a parallel 
force P passing through the centroidal axis along 
with a couple (P ¥ e) as shown in Figs 4.9(b) and 
(c) respectively. In Fig. 4.9(b), the force P causes 
a uniformly distributed tensile stress of magnitude 
(P/A). In Fig. 4.9(c), the couple causes bending 
stress of magnitude (Pey/I). The resultant stresses 
at the cross-section are obtained by the principle of 
superimposition of stresses. They are given by,

4.8 DESIGN OF SIMPLE MACHINE 
PARTS
In this chapter, design of simple machine parts is 
illustrated with the help of examples. The following 
points should be remembered in solving such 
problems:
 
(i) The dimensions of simple machine parts are 
determined on the basis of pure tensile stress, 
pure compressive stress, direct shear stress, 
bending stress or torsional shear stress. The 
analysis is simple but approximate, because 
a number of factors such as principal 
stresses, stress concentration, and reversal 
of stresses is neglected. Therefore, a higher 
factor of safety of up to 5 is taken to account 
for these factors.
 (ii) It is incorrect to assume allowable stress as 
data for design. The allowable stress is to be 
obtained from published values of ultimate 
tensile strength and yield strength for a given 
material by Eqs (4.1) and (4.2) respectively.
 (iii) It will be proved at a later stage that 
according to maximum shear stress theory, 
the yield strength in shear is 50% of the 
yield strength in tension. Therefore,
 
 
Ssy = 0.5 Syt 
 
 
and the permissible shear stress (t) is given by
 
 
t =
S
fs
sy
(
)
The above value of allowable shear stress is used 
in determination of dimensions of the component.
The design analysis in this chapter is 
approximate and incomplete. The purpose of such 
problems is to illustrate the application of design 
equations to ﬁ nd out the geometric dimensions 
of the component. In practice, much more stress 
analysis is involved in the design of machine parts.
Example 4.1 
Two plates, subjected to a tensile 
force of 50 kN, are ﬁ xed together by means of three 
rivets as shown in Fig. 4.10 (a). The plates and 
rivets are made of plain carbon steel 10C4 with 
a tensile yield strength of 250 N/mm2. The yield 
strength in shear is 50% of the tensile yield strength, 
and the factor of safety is 2.5. Neglecting stress 
concentration, determine
(i) the diameter of the rivets; and
(ii) the thickness of the plates.

4.9 COTTER JOINT
A cotter joint is used to connect two co-axial rods, 
which are subjected to either axial tensile force or 
axial compressive force. It is also used to connect 
a rod on one side with some machine part like a 
crosshead or base plate on the other side. It is not 
used for connecting shafts that rotate and transmit 
torque. Typical applications of cotter joint are as 
follows:
 
(i) Joint between the piston rod and the 
crosshead of a steam engine
 (ii) Joint between the slide spindle and the fork 
of the valve mechanism
 (iii) Joint between the piston rod and the tail or 
pump rod

 (iv) Foundation bolt
The principle of wedge action is used in a 
cotter joint. A cotter is a wedge-shaped piece 
made of a steel plate. The joint is tightened and 
adjusted by means of a wedge action of the cotter. 
The construction of a cotter joint, used to connect 
two rods A and B is shown in Fig. 4.11. Rod-A is 
provided with a socket end, while rod-B is provided 
with a spigot end. The socket end of rod-A ﬁ ts over 
the spigot end of rod-B. The socket as well as the 
spigot is provided with a narrow rectangular slot. 
A cotter is tightly ﬁ tted in this slot passing through 
the socket and the spigot. The cotter has uniform 
thickness and the width dimension b is given a 
slight taper. The taper is usually 1 in 24. The taper 
is provided for the following two reasons:
86 Design of Machine Elements
the joint in operating condition and prevents 
loosening of the parts.
 (ii) Due to its taper shape, it is easy to remove 
the cotter and dismantle the joint.
 
(i) When the cotter is inserted in the slot 
through the socket and the spigot and pressed 
by means of hammer, it becomes tight due 
to wedge action. This ensures tightness of 
Fig. 4.11 Cotter Joint
The taper of the cotter as well as slots is on one 
side. Machining a taper on two sides of a machine 
part is more difﬁ cult than making a taper on one 
side. Also, there is no speciﬁ c advantage of a 
taper on two sides. A clearance of 1.5 to 3 mm is 
provided between the slots and the cotter. When the 
cotter is driven in the slots, the two rods are drawn 
together until the spigot collar rests on the socket 
collar. The amount by which the two rods are 
drawn together is called the draw of the cotter. The 
cotter joint offers the following advantages:
 
(i) The assembly and dismantling of parts of 
the cotter joint is quick and simple. The 
assembly consists of inserting the spigot end 
into the socket end and putting the cotter 
into their common slot. When the cotter is 
hammered, the rods are drawn together and 
tightened. Dismantling consists of removing 
the cotter from the slot by means of a 
hammer.
 (ii) The wedge action develops a very high 
tightening force, which prevents loosening 
of parts in service.
 (iii) The 
joint 
is 
simple 
to 
design 
and 
manufacture.
Free body diagram of forces acting on three 
components of cotter joint, viz., socket, cotter 
and spigot is shown in Fig. 4.12. This diagram is 
constructed by using the principle that actions and 
reactions are equal and opposite. The forces are 
determined in the following way, 
Design against Static Load 87
 
(i) Consider rod–A with a socket end. The rod 
is subjected to a horizontal force P to the 
left. The sum of all horizontal forces acting 
on the rod A with socket must be equal to 
zero. Therefore, there should be a force P to 
the right acting on the socket. This force is 
shown by two parts, each equal to (P/2) on 
the socket end.
 (ii) Consider rod-B with the spigot end. The rod 
is subjected to a force P to the right. The sum 
of all horizontal forces acting on rod-B must 
be equal to zero. Therefore, there should be a 
force P to the left on the spigot end.
 (iii) The forces shown on the cotter are equal and 
opposite reactions of forces acting on the spigot 
end of rod-B and the socket end of rod-A.
Fig. 4.12 Free Body Diagram of Forces
For the purpose of stress analysis, the following 
assumptions are made:
 
(i) The rods are subjected to axial tensile force.
 (ii) The effect of stress concentration due to the 
slot is neglected.
 (iii) The stresses due to initial tightening of the 
cotter are neglected.
 In Fig. 4.11, the following notations are used
 
P  =  tensile force acting on rods (N)
 
d = diameter of each rod (mm)
 
d1 = outside diameter of socket (mm)
 
d2 = diameter of spigot or inside diameter of 
 socket (mm)
 
d3 = diameter of spigot-collar (mm)
 
d4 = diameter of socket-collar (mm)
 
a = distance from end of slot to the end of 
 spigot on rod-  (mm)
 
b = mean width of cotter (mm)
 
c = axial distance from slot to end of socket 
 collar (mm)
 
t = thickness of cotter (mm)
 
t1 = thickness of spigot-collar (mm)
 
l = length of cotter (mm)
In order to design the cotter joint and ﬁ nd out 
the above dimensions, failures in different parts and 
at different cross-sections are considered. Based 
on each type of failure, one strength equation is 
written. Finally, these strength equations are used 
to determine various dimensions of the cotter joint.

subjected to double shear as shown in Fig. 4.13(b).

The taper of the cotter is 1 in 32.
Example 4.2 It is required to design a cotter joint 
to connect two steel rods of equal diameter. Each 
rod is subjected to an axial tensile force of 50 kN. 
Design the joint and specify its main dimensions.
Solution
Given P = (50 × 103) N
Part I Selection of material
The rods are subjected to tensile force and strength 
is the criterion for the selection of the rod material. 
The cotter is subjected to direct shear stress and 
bending stresses. Therefore, strength is also the 
criterion of material selection for the cotter. On the 
basis of strength, the material of the two rods and 
the cotter is selected as plain carbon steel of Grade 
30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2). 
Part II Selection of factor of safety
In stress analysis of the cotter joint, the following 
factors are neglected:
 
(i) initial stresses due to tightening of the cotter; 
and
 (ii) stress concentration due to slot in the socket 
and the spigot ends.
To account for these factors, a higher factor of 
safety is used in the present design. The factor of 
safety for the rods, spigot end and socket end is 
assumed as 6, while for the cotter, it is taken as 4. 
There are two reasons for assuming a lower factor 
of safety for the cotter. They are as follows:
 
(i) There is no stress concentration in the cotter.
 (ii) The cost of the cotter is small compared 
with the socket end or spigot end. If at all, 
a failure is going to occur, it should occur in 
the cotter rather than in the spigot or socket 
end. This is ensured by assuming a higher 
factor of safety for the spigot and socket 
ends, compared with the cotter.
It is assumed that the yield strength in 
compression is twice the yield strength in tension.
Part III Calculation of permissible stresses
The permissible stresses for rods, spigot end and 
socket end are as follows:

4.11 KNUCKLE JOINT
Knuckle joint is used to connect two rods whose 
axes either coincide or intersect and lie in one 
plane. The knuckle joint is used to transmit axial 
tensile force. The construction of this joint permits 
limited angular movement between rods, about 
the axis of the pin. This type of joint is popular in 
Design against Static Load 95
machines and structures. Typical applications of 
knuckle joints are as follows: 
 
(i) Joints between the tie bars in roof trusses.
 (ii) Joints between the links of a suspension 
bridge.
 (iii) Joints in valve mechanism of a reciprocating 
engine.
 (iv) Fulcrum for the levers.
 (v) Joints between the links of a bicycle chain.
A knuckle joint is unsuitable to connect 
two rotating shafts, which transmit torque. The 
construction of a knuckle joint, used to connect two 
rods A and B subjected to tensile force P, is shown 
in Fig. 4.18. An eye is formed at the end of rod-
B, while a fork is formed at the end of rod-A. The 
eye ﬁ ts inside the fork and a pin passes through 
both the fork and the eye. This pin is secured in its 
place by means of a split-pin. Due to this type of 
construction, a knuckle joint is sometimes called 
a forked-pin joint. In rare applications, a knuckle 
joint is used to connect three rods—two with forks 
and a third with the eye.
Fig. 4.18 Knuckle Joint
96 Design of Machine Elements
The knuckle joint offers the following adva-
ntages:
 
(i) The 
joint 
is 
simple 
to 
design 
and 
manufacture.
 (ii) There are a few parts in the knuckle joint, 
which reduces cost and improves reliability.
 (iii) The assembly or dismantling of the parts 
of a knuckle joint is quick and simple. The 
assembly consists of inserting the eye of 
one rod inside the fork of the other rod and 
putting the pin in their common hole and 
ﬁ nally putting the split-pin to hold the pin. 
Dismantling consists of removing the split-pin 
and taking the pin out of the eye and the fork.
In Fig. 4.18, the following notations are used.
D = diameter of each rod (mm)
D1 = enlarged diameter of each rod (mm)
d = diameter of knuckle pin (mm)
d0 = outside diameter of eye or fork (mm)
a = thickness of each eye of fork (mm)
b = thickness of eye end of rod-B (mm)
d1 = diameter of pin head (mm)
x = distance of the centre of fork radius R from 
the eye (mm)
For the purpose of stress analysis of a knuckle 
joint, the following assumptions are made:
 
(i) The rods are subjected to axial tensile force.
 (ii) The effect of stress concentration due to 
holes is neglected.
 (iii) The force is uniformly distributed in various 
parts.
Free body diagram of forces acting on three 
components of the knuckle joint, viz., fork, pin 
and eye is shown in Fig. 4.19. This diagram is 
constructed by using the principle that actions and 
reactions are equal and opposite. The forces are 
determined in the following way,
 
(i) Consider rod-A with the fork end. The rod is 
subjected to a horizontal force P to the left. 
The sum of all horizontal forces acting on 
rod-A must be equal to zero. Therefore, there 
should be a force P to the right acting on the 
fork end. The force P is divided into two 
parts, each equal to (P/2) on the fork end. 
 (ii) Consider rod-B with the eye end. The rod is 
subjected to a horizontal force P to the right 
side. The sum of all horizontal forces acting 
on rod-B must be equal to zero. Therefore, 
there should be a force P to the left acting on 
the eye end.
Fig. 4.19 Free Body Diagram of Forces
 (iii) The forces shown on the pin are equal and 
opposite reactions of forces acting on the 
fork end of rod-A and the eye end of rod-B.
In order to ﬁ nd out various dimensions of the 
parts of a knuckle joint, failures in different parts 
and at different cross-sections are considered. 
For each type of failure, one strength equation is 
written. Finally, these strength equations are used 
to ﬁ nd out various dimensions of the knuckle joint.
(i) Tensile Failure of Rods Each rod is subjected 
to a tensile force P. The tensile stress in the rod is 
given by,

relationship,

to bending moment as shown in Fig. 4.22. It is 
assumed that the load acting on the pin is uniformly 
distributed in the eye, but uniformly varying in two 
parts of the fork. For triangular distribution of load

100 Design of Machine Elements
Example 4.5 
It is required to design a knuckle 
joint to connect two circular rods subjected to an 
axial tensile force of 50 kN. The rods are co-axial 
and a small amount of angular movement between 
their axes is permissible. Design the joint and 
specify the dimensions of its components. Select 
suitable materials for the parts.
Solution 
Given P = (50 ¥ 103) N
Part I Selection of material
The rods are subjected to tensile force. Therefore, 
yield strength is the criterion for the selection of 
material for the rods. The pin is subjected to shear 
stress and bending stresses. Therefore, strength is 
also the criterion of material selection for the pin. 
On strength basis, the material for two rods and pin 
is selected as plain carbon steel of Grade 30C8 (Syt 
= 400 N/mm2). It is further assumed that the yield 
strength in compression is equal to yield strength 
in tension. In practice, the compressive strength of 
steel is much higher than its tensile strength. 
Part II Selection of factor of safety
In stress analysis of knuckle joint, the effect of 
stress concentration is neglected. To account for 
this effect, a higher factor of safety of 5 is assumed 
in the present design.

4.13 PRINCIPAL STRESSES
In previous articles and examples, mechanical 
components, which are subjected to only one type of 
load, are considered. There are many components, 
which are subjected to several types of load 
simultaneously. A transmission shaft is subjected 
to bending as well as torsional moment at the same 
time. In design, it is necessary to determine the 
state of stresses under these conditions. An element 
of a plate subjected to two-dimensional stresses is 
shown is Fig. 4.30(a). In this analysis, the stresses 
are classiﬁ ed into two groups—normal stresses and 
shear stresses. The normal stress is perpendicular to 
the area under consideration, while the shear stress 
acts over the area.
 There is a particular system of notation for these 
stresses. The normal stresses are denoted by sx, sy 
and sz in the X, Y and Z directions respectively. 
Tensile stresses are considered to be positive, 
while compressive stresses as negative. The shear 
stresses are denoted by two subscripts, viz. txy or 
tyz, as shown in Fig. 4.30(a). The ﬁ rst subscript 
denotes the area over which it acts and the second 
indicates the direction of shear force. As an 
example, consider the shear stress denoted by txy. 
The subscript x indicates that the shear stress is 
acting on the area, which is perpendicular to the X-
axis. The subscript y indicates that the shear stress 
is acting in the Y-direction. The shear stresses are 
positive if they act in the positive direction of the 
reference axis. It can be proved that,
 
txy = tyx

One of the most effective methods to determine

is the construction of Mohr’s circle diagram as 
shown in Fig. 4.30 (c). It is a graphical method 
for the representation of stresses. The following 
conventions are used to construct the Mohr’s circle:
 
(i) The normal stresses sx, sy, and the principal 
stresses s1, s2 are plotted on the abscissa. 
The tensile stress, considered as positive, 
is plotted to the right of the origin and the 
compressive stress, considered as negative,

 (ii) The shear stresses txy, tyx and the principal 
shear stress tmax are plotted on the ordinate. 
A pair of shear stresses is considered as 
positive if they tend to rotate the element 
clockwise, and negative if they tend to rotate 
it anticlockwise.
The Mohr’s circle in Fig. 4.30 (c) is constructed

It can be proved that points F and G represent 
the maximum and minimum principal stresses s1 
and s2 respectively. The two principal shear stresses 
±tmax are denoted by points H and I respectively.
4.14  THEORIES OF ELASTIC FAILURE
There are number of machine components, 
which are subjected to several types of loads 
simultaneously. For example, a power screw is 
subjected to torsional moment as well as axial 
force. Similarly, an overhang crank is subjected 
to combined bending and torsional moments. The 
bolts of the bracket are subjected to forces that 
cause tensile stress and shear stress. Crankshaft, 
propeller shaft and connecting rod are examples 
of components subjected to complex loads. When 
the component is subjected to several types 
of loads, combined stresses are induced. For 
example, torsional moment induces torsional shear 
stress, while bending moment causes bending 
stresses in the transmission shaft. The failures 
of such components are broadly classiﬁ ed into 
two groups—elastic failure and yielding and 
fracture. Elastic failure results in excessive elastic 
deformation, which makes the machine component 
unﬁ t to perform its function satisfactorily. Yielding 
results in excessive plastic deformation after the 
yield point stress is reached, while fracture results 
in breaking the component into two or more pieces. 
Theories of failure discussed in this article are 
applicable to elastic failure of machine parts.
 The design of machine parts subjected to 
combined loads should be related to experimentally 
determined properties of material under ‘similar’ 
conditions. However, it is not possible to conduct 
such tests for different possible combinations 
of loads and obtain mechanical properties. In 
practice, the mechanical properties are obtained 
from a simple tension test. They include yield 
strength, ultimate tensile strength and percentage 
elongation. In the tension test, the specimen is 
axially loaded in tension. It is not subjected to 
either bending moment or torsional moment or a 
combination of loads. Theories of elastic failure 
provide a relationship between the strength of 
machine component subjected to complex state of 
stresses with the mechanical properties obtained 
in tension test. With the help of these theories, 
the data obtained in the tension test can be used 
to determine the dimensions of the component, 
irrespective of the nature of stresses induced in the 
component due to complex loads.
 Several theories have been proposed, each assum-
ing a different hypothesis of failure. The principal 
theories of elastic failure are as follows:
 
(i) Maximum principal stress theory (Rankine’s 
theory)
 (ii) Maximum shear stress theory (Coulomb, 
Tresca and Guest’s theory)
 (iii) Distortion energy theory (Huber von Mises 
and Hencky’s theory)
 (iv) Maximum strain theory (St. Venant’s theory) 
 (v) Maximum total strain energy theory (Haigh’s 
theory)
We will discuss the ﬁ rst three theories in 
this chapter. Let us assume s1, s2 and s3 as 
the principal stresses induced at a point on the 
machine part as a result of several types of loads. 
We will apply the theories of failure to obtain the 
relationship between s1, s2 and s3  on one hand 
and the properties of material such as Syt or Sut on 
the other.
Design against Static Load 107
4.15  MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL STRESS 
THEORY
This criterion of failure is accredited to the British 
engineer WJM Rankine (1850). The theory states 
that the failure of the mechanical component 
subjected to bi-axial or tri-axial stresses occurs 
when the maximum principal stress reaches the 
yield or ultimate strength of the material.
If  s1, s2 and s3   are the three principal stresses 
at a point on the component and 
 
s1 > s2 > s3
then according to this theory, the failure occurs 
whenever
 
 s1 = Syt 
 or 
s1 = Sut 
(4.35)
whichever is applicable.
 The theory considers only the maximum of princi-
pal stresses and disregards the inﬂ uence of the other 
principal stresses. The dimensions of the component 
are determined by using a factor of safety.

Region of Safety
The construction of region of safety for bi-axial 
stresses is illustrated in Fig. 4.31. The two principal 
stresses s 1 and s 2 are plotted on X and Y axes re-
spectively. Tensile stresses are considered as positive, 
Fig. 4.31 Boundary for Maximum Principal Stress 
Theory under Bi-axial Stresses
while compressive stresses as negative. It is further 
assumed that
 Syc = Syt
It should be noted that,
 
(i) The equation of vertical line to the positive 
side of X-axis is ( x = + a)
 (ii) The equation of vertical line to the negative 
side of X-axis is ( x = – a)
 (iii) The equation of horizontal line to the 
positive  side of Y-axis is ( y = + b)
 (iv) The equation of horizontal line to the 
negative side of Y-axis is ( y = – b)
The borderline for the region of safety for this 
theory can be constructed in the following way:
Step 1: Suppose s1 > s2 As per this theory, we will 
consider only the maximum of principal stresses 
(s1) and disregard the other principal stress (s2).
Suppose (s1) is the tensile stress. The limiting 
value of (s1) is yield stress (Syt). Therefore, the 
boundary line will be,
s1 = + Syt
A vertical line AB is constructed such that s1 = 
+ Syt.
Step 2: Suppose s1 > s2 and (s1) is compressive 
stress. The limiting value of (s1) is compressive 
yield stress (– Syc). Therefore, the boundary line 
will be,
s1 = – Syc
A vertical line DC  is constructed such that s1 
= – Syc.
Step 3: Suppose s2 > s1 As per this theory, we will 
consider only the maximum of principal stresses 
(s2) and disregard the other principal stress (s1). 
Suppose (s2) is the tensile stress. The limiting 
value of (s2) is the yield stress (Syt). Therefore, the 
boundary line will be,
s2 = + Syt
A horizontal line CB  is constructed such that s2 
= + Syt
108 Design of Machine Elements
Step 4: Suppose s2 > s1 and (s2) is the compressive 
stress. The limiting value of (s2) is compressive 
yield stress (– Syc). Therefore, the boundary line 
will be,
 s2 = – Syc
A horizontal line DA  is constructed such that
s2 = – Syc.
The complete region of safety is the area ABCD. 
Since we have assumed (Syc = Syt), ABCD is a 
square. 
According to the maximum principal stress 
theory of failure, if a point with co-ordinates (s1, 
s2) falls outside this square then it indicates the 
failure condition. On the other hand, if the point 
falls inside the square, the design is safe and the 
failure may not occur.
 Experimental investigations suggest that the 
maximum principal stress theory gives good 
predictions for brittle materials. However, it is not 
recommended for ductile materials.
4.16 MAXIMUM SHEAR STRESS THEORY
This criterion of failure is accredited to CA Coulomb, 
H Tresca and JJ Guest. The theory states that the fail-
ure of a mechanical component subjected to bi-axial
 
Fig. 4.32 (a) Stresses in Simple Tension Test 
(b) Mohr’s Circle for Stresses
or tri-axial stresses occurs when the maximum shear 
stress at any point in the component becomes equal to 
the maximum shear stress in the standard specimen of 
the tension test, when yielding starts. In the tension 
test, the specimen is subjected to uni-axial stress (s1) 
and (s2 = 0). The stress in the specimen of tension 
test and the corresponding Mohr’s circle diagram are 
shown in Fig. 4.32. From the ﬁ gure,
tmax = s1
2
When the specimen starts yielding (s1 = Syt), the 
above equation is written as
t max =
S yt
2
Therefore, the maximum shear stress theory 
predicts that the yield strength in shear is half of 
the yield strength in tension, i.e.,
 
Ssy = 0.5 Syt 
(4.38)
Suppose s1, s2 and s3 are the three principal 
stresses at a point on the component, the shear 
stresses on three different planes are given by,

The above equations can be written as, 
 
s1 – s2 = ± Syt 
[Assuming Syc = Syt ]
 
s2 – s3 = ± Syc
 
s3 – s1 = ± Syt
Region of Safety For bi-axial stresses, 
 
s3 = 0
The above equations can be written as, 
 
s1 – s2 = + Syt 
 (h) 
 
s2 = + Syt 
(i) 
 
s1 = + Syt 
(j)
It will be observed at a later stage that Eq. (h) 
are applicable in second and fourth quadrants, 
while Eqs (i) and (j) are applicable in the ﬁ rst and 
third quadrants of the diagram. 
 The construction of region of safety is illustrated 
in Fig. 4.33. The two principal stresses s1 and 
s2 are plotted on the X and Y axes respectively. 
Tensile stresses are considered as positive, while 
compressive stresses as negative. 
Fig. 4.33 Boundary for Maximum Shear Stress Theory 
under Bi-axial Stresses
It should be noted that,
 
(i) The equation (x – y = – a) indicates a 
straight line in the second quadrant with (–a) 
and (+ a) as intercepts on the X and Y axes 
respectively.
 (ii) The equation (x – y = + a) indicates a 
straight line in the fourth quadrant with (+ a) 
and (– a) as intercepts on the X and Y axes 
respectively.
The borderline for the region of safety for this 
theory can be constructed in the following way:
Step 1: In the ﬁ rst quadrant, both (s1) and (s2) 
are positive or tensile stresses. The yielding 
will depend upon where (s1) or (s2) is greater in 
magnitude.
Suppose 
s1 > s2
The boundary line will be,
 
 
s1 = + Syt
A vertical line AB  is constructed such that  
 
 
s1 = + Syt.
Suppose 
s2 > s1
The boundary line will be,
 
 
s2 = + Syt
A horizontal line CB  is constructed such that s2 
= + Syt
Step 2: In the third quadrant, both (s1) and (s2) 
are negative or compressive stresses. The yielding 
will depend upon whether (s1) or (s2) is greater in 
magnitude.
Suppose 
s1 > s2
The boundary line will be,
 
 
s1 = – Syt
A vertical line DE  is constructed such that 
 
 
s1 = – Syt
Suppose 
s2 > s1
The boundary line will be,
 
 
s2 = – Syt
A horizontal line EF is constructed such that  
 
 
s2 = – Syt
Step 3: In the second and fourth quadrants, (s1) 
and (s2) are of opposite sign. One stress is tensile 
while the other is compressive. The yielding will 
occur when,
 
 
s1 – s2 = + Syt
In the second quadrant, line DC  is constructed 
such that,
 
 
s1 – s2 = – Syt
It is observed that the intercept of the above line 
on the X-axis (s2 = 0) is (– Syt) and intercept on the 
Y-axis (s1 = 0) is (+ Syt).
110 Design of Machine Elements
Step 4: In the fourth quadrant, line FA  is 
constructed such that,
 
 
s1 – s2 = + Syt
It is observed that the intercept of the above line 
on the X-axis (s2 = 0) is (+ Syt) and intercept on the 
Y-axis (s1 = 0) is (– Syt).
The complete region of safety is the hexagon 
ABCDEFA.
 In case of bi-axial stress, if a point with 
coordinates (s1, s2) falls outside this hexagon 
region, then it indicates the failure condition. On 
the other hand, if the point falls inside the hexagon, 
the design is safe and the failure may not occur.
Shear Diagonal Shear diagonal or line of pure 
shear is the locus of all points, corresponding to 
pure shear stress. It will be proved at a later stage 
(Fig. 4.35) that for pure shear stress,
s1 = – s2 = t12
The above equation can be written as, 
s

A line GH  is constructed in such a way that it passes 
through the origin O and makes an angle of – 45° with 
the Y-axis. This line is called shear diagonal or line 
of pure shear. This line intersects the hexagon at two 
points G and H. The point of intersection of lines FA

 The maximum shear stress theory of failure is widely

4.17  DISTORTION-ENERGY THEORY
This theory was advanced by MT Huber in Poland 
(1904) and independently by R von Mises in Germany 
(1913) and H Hencky (1925). It is known as the Huber 
von Mises and Hencky’s theory. The theory states that 
the failure of the mechanical component subjected to 
bi-axial or tri-axial stresses occurs when the strain 
energy of distortion per unit volume at any point in 
the component, becomes equal to the strain energy of 
distortion per unit volume in the standard specimen 
of tension-test, when yielding starts.
 A unit cube subjected to the three principal stresses 
s1, s2 and s3 is shown in Fig. 4.34(a). The total strain 
energy U of the cube is given by,

The components s1d, s2d and s3d cause distortion of 
the cube, while the component sv results in volumet-
ric change. Since the components s1d, s2d and s3d do 
not change the volume of the cube,

If a point with coordinates (s1, s2) falls outside

design is safe and the failure may not occur.
Shear Diagonal As mentioned in the previous 
section, shear diagonal or line of pure shear is the 
locus of all points, corresponding to pure shear 
stress. The condition for the line of shear is,

A line AB is constructed in such a way that it passes 
through the origin O and makes an angle of – 45° 
with the Y-axis. This line is called shear diagonal or 
line of pure shear. This line intersects the ellipse at 
two points A and B.

the failure of a ductile component than any other 
theory of failure.
4.18  SELECTION AND USE OF FAILURE 
 
THEORIES
The plots of three theories of failure on the s1, s 2 
coordinate system are shown in Fig. 4.37. While 
selecting theories of failure, the following points 
should be noted.
Design against Static Load 113
 
(i) Ductile materials typically have the same 
tensile strength and compressive strength. 
Also, yielding is the criterion of failure 
in ductile materials. In maximum shear 
stress theory and distortion energy theory, 
it is assumed that the yield strength in 
tension (Syt) is equal to the yield strength 
in compression (Syc). Also, the criterion of 
failure is yielding. Therefore, maximum 
shear stress theory and distortion energy 
theory are used for ductile materials.
Fig. 4.37 Comparison of Theories of Failure
 (ii) Distortion energy theory predicts yielding 
with precise accuracy in all four quadrants. 
The design calculations involved in this 
theory are slightly complicated as compared 
with those of maximum shear stress theory.
 (iii) The hexagonal diagram of maximum 
shear stress theory is inside the ellipse 
of distortion energy theory. Therefore, 
maximum shear stress theory gives results 
on the conservative side. On the other hand, 
distortion energy theory is slightly liberal.
 (iv) The graph of maximum principal stress 
theory is the same as that of maximum 
shear stress theory in the ﬁ rst and third 
quadrants. However, the graph of maximum 
principal stress theory is outside the ellipse 
of distortion energy theory in the second 
and fourth quadrants. Thus, it would be 
dangerous to apply maximum principal 
stress theory in these regions, since it might 
predict safety, when in fact no safety exists.
 (v) Maximum shear stress theory is used for 
ductile materials, if dimensions need not 
be held too close and a generous factor of 
safety is used. The calculations involved in 
this theory are easier than those of distortion 
energy theory.
 (vi) Distortion energy theory is used when the 
factor of safety is to be held in close limits 
and the cause of failure of the component is 
being investigated. This theory predicts the 
failure most accurately.
 (vii) The compressive strength of brittle materials 
is much higher than their tensile strength. 
Therefore, the failure criterion should show 
a difference in tensile and compressive 
strength. 
On 
this 
account, 
maximum 
principal stress theory is used for brittle 
materials. Also, brittle materials do not yield 
and they fail by fracture.
To summarise, the maximum principal stress 
theory is the proper choice for brittle materials. 
For ductile materials, the choice of theory depends 
on the level of accuracy required and the degree 
of computational difﬁ culty the designer is ready 
to face. For ductile materials, the most accurate 
way to design is to use distortion energy theory 
of failure and the easiest way to design is to apply 
maximum shear stress theory
Example 4.11 A cantilever beam of rectangular 
cross-section is used to support a pulley as shown 
in Fig. 4.38 (a). The tension in the wire rope is 5 
kN. The beam is made of cast iron FG 200 and the 
factor of safety is 2.5. The ratio of depth to width of 
the cross-section is 2. Determine the dimensions of 
the cross-section of the beam.

The stress is maximum at the point A in the section 
XX. The point is subjected to combined bending and 
direct tensile stresses. The force P is resolved into two 
components—horizontal component Ph and vertical 
component Pv.
 
 Ph = P sin 60° = 5000 sin 60° = 4330.13 N
 
 Pv = P cos 60° = 5000 cos 60° = 2500 N
The bending moment at the section XX is given by
 
Mb = Ph ¥ 150 + Pv ¥ 300

4.19 LEVERS
A lever is deﬁ ned as a mechanical device in the form 
of a rigid bar pivoted about the fulcrum to multiply or 
transfer the force. The construction of a simple lever 
is shown in Fig. 4.42. F is the force produced by the 
lever and P is the effort required to produce that force. 
The force F is often called ‘load’. The perpendicular 
distance of the line of action of any force from the 
fulcrum is called the arm of the lever. Therefore l1 
and l2 are the effort arm and load arm respectively. 
Taking moment of forces about the fulcrum,
 F ¥ l2 = P ¥ l1
or
 
F
l
l
r = 1
2  
(a)
Fig. 4.42 Construction of Lever
The ratio of load to effort, i.e., (F/P) is called the 
‘mechanical advantage’ of the lever. The ratio of 
the effort arm to the load arm, i.e., (l1/l2) is called 
the ‘leverage’. Therefore, mechanical advantage is 
equal to the leverage. It is seen by Eq. (a), that a large 
force can be exerted by a small effort by increasing 
leverage, i.e., increasing l1 and reducing l2. In many 
applications, it is not possible to increase effort arm 
l1 due to space restrictions. In such applications, 
compound levers are used to obtain more leverage.
 There are three types of levers, based on the 
relative positions of the effort point, the load point 
and the fulcrum as illustrated in Fig. 4.43. They are 
as follows:
Fig. 4.43 Types of Lever
 
(i) In the ‘ﬁ rst’ type of lever, the fulcrum is 
located between the load and the effort, as 
shown in Fig. 4.43(a). In this case, the effort 
arm can be kept less than the load arm or 
equal to the load arm or more than the load 
arm. Accordingly, the mechanical advantages 
will vary in the following way: 
 
 When l1 < l2,
 
  mechanical advantage < 1
 
 When l1 = l2,
 
  mechanical advantage = 1
 
 When l1 > l2,
 
  mechanical advantage > 1 
 
 Usually, the effort arm is kept more than the 
load arm to get mechanical advantage. This 
type of lever is used in applications like 
the rocker arm for the overhead valves of 
internal combustion engine, bell crank levers 
118 Design of Machine Elements
in railway signal mechanisms and levers of 
hand pumps.
 (ii) In the ‘second’ type of lever, the load is 
located between the fulcrum and the effort, 
as shown in Fig. 4.43(b). In this case, the 
effort arm is always more than the load arm 
and the mechanical advantage is more than 
1. This type of lever is used in lever-loaded 
safety valves mounted on the boilers.
 (iii) In the ‘third’ type of lever, the effort is 
located between the load and the fulcrum, as 
shown in Fig. 4.43(c). In this case, the load 
arm is always greater than the effort arm 
and the mechanical advantage is less than 
1. This type of lever is not recommended in 
engineering applications. A picking fork is 
an example of this type of lever.
Levers have wide applications, ranging from 
simple nutcrackers and paper punching machines 
to complex lever systems in scales and weighing 
machines.
4.20 DESIGN OF LEVERS 
Lever design is easy compared to design of other 
machine elements. The length of the lever is decided 
on the basis of leverage required to exert a given load 
F by means of an effort P. The cross-section of the 
lever is designed on the basis of bending stresses. The 
design of a lever consists of the following steps:
Step 1: Force Analysis
In any application, the load or the force F to be 
exerted by the lever is given. The effort required to 
produce this force is calculated by taking moments 
about the fulcrum. Therefore, 
 F ¥ l2 = P ¥ l1

The free body diagram of forces acting on the 
‘ﬁ rst’ type of lever is shown in Fig. 4.44. R is 
the reaction at the fulcrum pin. Since the sum of 
vertical forces acting on the lever must be equal to 
zero,
 
 R = F + P 
(4.47)
Fig. 4.44 Free body Diagram of Forces acting on First 
 
type of Lever
The free body diagram of forces acting on the 
‘second’ type of lever is shown in Fig 4.45. In 
this case, the load and the effort act in opposite 
directions. Considering equilibrium of forces in a 
vertical direction,
F = R + P
or,
 
R = F – P 
(4.48)
 
Fig. 4.45 
Free body Diagram of Forces acting on 
Second type of Lever
In the above two cases, the forces are assumed 
to be parallel. Sometimes, the forces F and P 
act along lines that are inclined to one another 
as shown in Fig. 4.46. In such cases, l1 is the 
perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the 
line of action of the force P. Similarly, l2 is the
Fig. 4.46
perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the line 
of action of the force F. The following rules from 
statics apply to the reaction R at the fulcrum: 
Design against Static Load 119
 
(i) The magnitude of the reaction R is equal to 
the resultant of the load F and the effort P. 
It is determined by the parallelogram law of 
forces.
 (ii) The line of action of the reaction R passes 
through the intersection of P and F, i.e., the 
point O in Fig. 4.46 and also through the 
fulcrum.
Figure 4.47 illustrates a bell-crank lever with the 
arms that are inclined at angle q with one another. 
The load F and the effort P act at right angles to 
their respective arms. The reaction R at the fulcrum

Step 2: Design of Lever Arm
 When the forces acting on the lever are determined, 
the next step in lever design is to ﬁ nd out the dimen-
sions of the cross-section of the lever. The cross-
section of the lever is subjected to bending moment. 
In case of a two-arm lever, as shown in Fig. 4.48(a), 
the bending moment is zero at the point of applica-
tion of P or F and maximum at the boss of the lever. 
The cross-section at which the bending moment 
is maximum can be determined by constructing 
a bending-moment diagram. In Fig. 4.48(b), the 
bending moment is maximum at section XX and it 
is given by, 
 Mb = P (l1 – d1)
The cross-section of the lever can be rectangular, 
elliptical or I-section.

Figure 4.48(b) shows the variation of bending mo-
ment. It varies from a maximum value Mb at the 
section XX to zero at the point of application of P. 
Therefore, the cross-section of the arm is usually 
tapered from the boss of the fulcrum to the end.
Step 3: Design of Fulcrum Pin
 The fulcrum pin is subjected to reaction R as shown 
in Fig. 4.49. The forces acting on the boss of lever 
and the pin are equal and opposite. The dimensions 
of the pin, viz., diameter d1 and length l1 in lever boss 
are determined by bearing consideration and then 
checked for shear consideration. There is relative mo-
tion between the pin and the boss of lever and bearing 
pressure becomes the design criterion. The projected 
area of the pin is (d1 ¥ l1). Therefore,
 
 
 R = p (d1 ¥ l1 ) 
(4.51)
where p is the the permissible bearing pressure.
For the fulcrum pin, the ratio of length to 
diameter (l1/d1) is usually taken from 1 to 2. The 
outside diameter of the boss in the lever is taken 
as twice of the diameter of the pin, i.e., (2d1). 
A phosphor bronze bush, usually 3 mm thick, is 
ﬁ tted inside the boss to reduce the friction. The 
permissible bearing pressure for a phosphor bronze 
bush is 5 to 10 N/mm2. A lubricant is provided 
between the pin and the bush to reduce the friction.
It can be observed that expressions for bearing 
pressure and compressive or crushing stress are 
same. Rearranging Eq. (4.51), the bearing pressure 
is given by,

Although the expressions (a) and (b) are same, there 
is a basic difference between bearing pressure and 
crushing or compressive stress. The bearing pres-
sure is considered when there is relative motion 
between two surfaces such as surfaces of the pin 
and the bushing. On the other hand, crushing stress 
is considered when there is no relative motion be-
tween the surfaces under consideration. The bearing 
pressure is always low such as 10 N/mm2, while 
the magnitude of compressive stress is high such as
Design against Static Load 121
150 N/mm2. A rotating shaft in the bearing, a fulcrum 
pin of an oscillating lever, a power screw rotating 
inside the nut are examples where bearing pressure 
is the design consideration. The contact area between 
a cotter and spigot end, and cotter and socket end; 
between knuckle pin and eye or knuckle pin and 
fork are the examples where crushing stress is the 
criterion of design.
Example 4.15 A lever-loaded safety valve is 
mounted on the boiler to blow off at a pressure of 1.5 
MPa gauge. The effective diameter of the opening 
of the valve is 50 mm. The distance between the 
fulcrum and the dead weights on the lever is 1000 
mm. The distance between the fulcrum and the pin 
connecting the valve spindle to the lever is 100 mm. 
The lever and the pin are made of plain carbon steel 
30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) and the factor of safety is 
5. The permissible bearing pressure at the pins in 
the lever is 25 N/mm2. The lever has a rectangular 
cross-section and the ratio of width to thickness is 
3:1. Design a suitable lever for the safety valve.
Solution 
Given Syt = 400 N/mm2 (fs) = 5
For valve,  d = 50 mm 
p = 1.5 MPa
For lever, l1 = 1000 mm l2 = 100 mm 
d/b = 3
For pin, 
 p = 25 N/mm2
The construction of the lever-loaded safety 
valve is shown in Fig. 4.50. It is mounted on steam 
boilers to limit the maximum steam pressure. When 
the pressure inside the boiler exceeds this limiting 
value, the valve automatically opens due to excess 
of steam pressure and steam blows out through the 
valve. Consequently, the steam pressure inside the

Step II Calculation of forces acting on lever
The valve is held tight on the valve seat against 
the upward steam force F by the dead weights P 
attached at the end of the lever. The distance l1 and 
the dead weights P are adjusted in such a way, that 
when the steam pressure inside the boiler reaches 
the limiting value, the moment (F ¥ l2) overcomes 
the moment (P ¥ l1). As a result, the valve opens 
and steam blows out until the pressure falls to 
the required limiting value and then the valve is 
automatically closed.
The maximum steam load F, at which the valve 
blows off is given by,

The forces acting on the lever are shown in
Fig. 4.51(a). Considering equilibrium of vertical 
forces,

Step III Diameter and length of pin
From (a), (b) and (c), the pin at the point of application 
of the force F is subjected to maximum force and as 
such, it is to be designed from bearing consideration. 
Suppose, d1 and l1 are the diameter and the length of 
the pin at F and assume,
 l1 = d1
From Eq. (4.51),
 F = p (d1 ¥ l1) or 2945.24 = 25 (d1 ¥ d1 )
 \ d1 = 10.85 or 12 mm
 
 l1 = d1 = 12 mm

The force on the fulcrum pin (R) is 
comparatively less than the force acting on the 
spindle pin (F). Therefore, the dimensions d1 and 
l1 of the pin at the fulcrum will be slightly less. 
However, we will assume both pins of the same 
diameter and length to facilitate interchangeability 
of parts and variety reduction. 
Step IV Width and thickness of lever
A gunmetal bush of 2-mm thickness is press ﬁ tted at 
both pin holes to reduce friction. Therefore, the inside 
diameter of the boss will be (d1 + 2 ¥ 2) or (12 + 2 ¥ 
2) or 16 mm. The outside diameter of the boss is kept 
twice of the inside diameter, i.e., 32 mm.
 The bending moment diagram for the lever is 
shown in Fig. 4.51(b). The bending moment is 
maximum at the valve spindle axis. It is given by,
 Mb = P (1000 – 100) = 294.52 (1000 – 100) 
 
= 265 068 N-mm

The lever becomes weak due to the pinhole at

bending stresses at this critical section. The cross-
section of the lever at the valve spindle axis is 
shown in Fig. 4.52. In this case, the length of the 
Fig. 4.52 Cross-section of Lever

practical proportions for the boss. For this cross-

Example 4.16 A right angled bell-crank lever is 
to be designed to raise a load of 5 kN at the short 
arm end. The lengths of short and long arms are 100 
and 450 mm respectively. The lever and the pins are 
made of steel 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) and the factor 
of safety is 5. The permissible bearing pressure on 
the pin is 10 N/mm2. The lever has a rectangular 
cross-section and the ratio of width to thickness is 
3:1. The length to diameter ratio of the fulcrum pin 
is 1.25:1. Calculate
 
(i) The diameter and the length of the fulcrum 
pin
 (ii) The shear stress in the pin
 (ii) The dimensions of the boss of the lever at the 
fulcrum
 (iii) The dimensions of the cross-section of the 
lever
Assume that the arm of the bending moment on 
the lever extends up to the axis of the fulcrum.
Solution 
Given Syt = 400 N/mm2 (fs) = 5 F = 5 kN
For lever, long arm = 450 mm 
short arm = 100 mm 
 d/b = 3
For pin

Step III Diameter and length of fulcrum pin

where,
d1= diameter of the fulcrum pin (mm)

p = permissible bearing pressure (N/mm2)
Substituting values in Eq. (a),
 
 5121.97 = 10 (d1 ¥ 1.25d1 )

Example 4.17 A pressure vessel, used in chemical 
process industries, is shown in Fig. 4.54. It is 
designed to withstand an internal gauge pressure of 
0.25 MPa (or 0.25 N/mm2). The cover is held tight 
against the vessel by means of a screw, which is 
turned down through the tapped hole in the beam, so 
that the end of the screw presses ﬁ rmly against the 
cover. The links L1 and L2 are attached to the beam 
on one side and to the extension cast on the vessel 
on the other side. The vessel and its cover are made 
of grey cast iron FG 200. The beam, screw, links and 
pins are made of steel FeE 250 (Syt = 250 N/mm2). 
The factor of safety for all parts is 5. The beam has 
a rectangular cross-section and the ratio of width to 
thickness is 2:1 (h = 2b). Assume the following data

(i) The sum of vertical forces acting on any part 
must be zero; and

then the compressive force is given by,
 F = a sc or  49087.39 = a (50)

From the given data, a screw of M42 size (stressed

of the screw is 42 mm and the pitch is 4.5 mm.
Step IV Cross-section of beam
As shown in Fig. 4.56(a), the beam is simply sup-
ported with a single concentrated load F at the centre 
of the span length. Due to symmetry of loading, the

factor of safety is 5. The pins at B, C and D are 
identical and their length to diameter ratio is 1.25.

The free body diagram of forces acting on various 
parts of the shearing machine is shown in Fig. 4.58. 
This diagram is constructed starting with shear 
force Ps acting on the bar and then proceeding to 
the block, link and the lever.
The direction of forces acting on the various parts 
is decided by using the following two principles:
 
(i) The action and reaction are equal and 
opposite.
 (ii) The sum of vertical forces acting on any part 
must be equal to zero.
Taking moment of forces acting on the block, as 
shown in Fig. 4.58(b) about the fulcrum A,
 P1 ¥ 400 = Ps ¥ 100 or 
P1 ¥ 400 = 10737.87 ¥ 100
\ P1 = 2684.47 N
Also, 
 RA + P1 = Ps or  RA = Ps – P1
 
RA = 10737.87 – 2684.47 = 8053.4 N
Taking moment of forces acting on lever, as shown 
in Fig. 4.58(d), about the fulcrum D,
 P ¥ 1000 = P1 ¥ 100 or  
 
P ¥ 1000 = 2684.47 ¥ 100 
\ P = 268.45 N
Also,
 RD + P = P1 or 
 RD = P1 – P = 2684.47 – 268.45 = 2416.02 N
Step III Diameter of pins 
The forces acting on the pins at B, C and D are 
2684.47, 2684.47 and 2416.02 N respectively. 
Fig. 4.58 Free-body Diagram of Forces
Since the three pins are identical, we will design 
the pin for maximum force of 2684.47 N. The 
dimensions of the pins are determined on the basis 
of bearing consideration and checked for shear 
consideration.
Considering bearing pressure on the pin,
R = p (projected area of the pin) = p (d1 ¥ l1 )
or 
R = p (d1 ¥ l1 )

where,

Fig. 4.60 Cross-section of Lever at Pin-C
The diameter of the pin is 15 mm, while the 
length is 20 mm. It is assumed that a gunmetal bush 
of 2.5 mm thickness is ﬁ tted in the hole to reduce 
friction and wear. Therefore, inner diameter of the

There is slight difference between bending stress 
(51.77 N/mm2 ) and permissible stress (50 N/mm2). 
Since the difference is small, it is neglected and 
the dimensions of the boss of the lever are kept 
unchanged.
4.21 FRACTURE MECHANICS
There was a series of catastrophic failures of 
pressure vessels, ships and aircrafts in 10 years 
between 1940 and 1950. These accidents focused 
the attention of design engineers to the existence 
Design against Static Load 129
and growth of cracks in machine components. 
Fracture mechanics has its origin in the work of AA 
Grifﬁ ths, who proved that the fracture strength of a 
brittle material, like glass, is inversely proportional 
to the square root of the crack length.
The concept of fracture mechanics begins 
with the assumption that all components contain 
microscopic cracks. In case of ductile materials, 
there is stress concentration in the vicinity of a 
crack. When the localized stress near the crack 
reaches the yield point, there is plastic deformation, 
resulting in redistribution of stresses. Therefore, the 
effect of crack is not serious in case of components 
made of ductile materials. However, the effect of 
crack is much more serious in case of components 
made of brittle materials due to their inability of 
plastic deformation. Fracture mechanics is normally 
concerned with materials that are in the brittle 
state. They include high-strength, low-alloy steels, 
high-strength aluminium alloys, titanium alloys 
and some polymers. They also include ‘normally 
ductile’ materials, which under certain conditions 
of thermal and corrosive environment, behave like 
brittle materials. For example, low carbon steels 
at temperatures below 0°C behave like brittle 
materials.
Fracture mechanics is the science of predicting 
the inﬂ uence of cracks and crack like defects 
on the brittle fracture of components. When a 
component containing a small microscopic crack 
is subjected to an external force, there is an almost 
instantaneous propagation of the crack leading to 
sudden and total failure. The crack is just like a 
dropped stitch in knitting. Propagation of a crack 
is like tearing a cloth. Once you start a little tear, 
it will propagate rather easily across the full length 
of the cloth. Less force is required to propagate a 
crack than to initiate it. Fracture failure occurs at a 
stress level which is well below the yield point of 
the material. Therefore, failure due to propagation 
of crack in components made of brittle materials is 
catastrophic.
Figure 4.61 shows a rectangular plate subjected 
to tensile stress in the longitudinal direction. The 
plate contains a sharp transverse crack located at 
the centre of the plate. The plate length 2h is large 
compared with the plate width 2b. Also, the plate 
width 2b is large compared with the crack length 
2a.
Fig. 4.61 Plate with Central Crack
There are two terms in fracture mechanics, viz., 
the stress intensity factor and fracture toughness. 
The stress intensity factor K0 speciﬁ es the stress 
intensity at the tip of the crack. It is given by,
K
a
0 = s p
 
(4.52)
where,
K0 = stress intensity factor (in units of 
 
N/mm2 
m )
s = nominal tensile stress at the edge 
P

Ê
ËÁ
ˆ
¯˜   
 
(N/mm2)
t = plate thickness (mm)
a = half crack length (m)
The fracture toughness is the critical value of 
stress intensity at which crack extension occurs. The 
fracture toughness is denoted by KI. It is given by,
 
 KI = Y K0 = Y
a
s p
 
(4.53)
where,
Y = dimensionless correction factor that accounts 
 
for the geometry of the part containing the 
 
crack
KI = fracture toughness (in units of N/mm2
m )
The variation of the correction factor Y for 
a plate containing a central crack subjected to 
tensile stress in longitudinal direction is shown in 
Fig. 4.62. For example, if h/b = 1.0 and a/b = 0.6 
then the value of Y from the graph in Fig. 4.62 is 
approximately 1.51. Therefore,
 KI = Y K0 = 1 51
.

Fig. 4.62 Y Factor for Plate with Central Crack
There is a basic difference between stress 
intensity factor K0 and fracture toughness KI, 
although they have the same units. The stress 
intensity factor K0 represents the stress level at 
the tip of the crack in the machine part. On the 
other hand, fracture toughness KI is the highest 
stress intensity that the part can withstand without 
fracture at the crack.
 There are three basic modes of crack propagation 
as illustrated in Fig. 4.63. Mode-I is called the 
opening or tensile mode. It is the most commonly 
observed mode of crack propagation. In this case, 
the crack faces separate symmetrically with respect 
to the crack plane. Mode-II is called sliding or in-
plane shearing mode. Mode-III is called tearing 
mode. Mode-II and Mode-III are fundamentally 
shear modes of failures.

4.22 CURVED BEAMS
A curved beam is deﬁ ned as a beam in which the 
neutral axis in unloaded condition is curved instead 
of straight. The following assumptions are made in 
the stress analysis of curved beam:
 
(i) Plane sections perpendicular to the axis of 
the beam remain plane after bending.
 (ii) The moduli of elasticity in tension and 
compression are equal.
 (iii) The material is homogeneous and obeys 
Hooke’s law.
The distribution of stresses in a curved beam is 
shown in Fig. 4.64. There are two factors, which 
distinguish the analysis of straight and curved 
beams. They are as follows:
 
(i) The neutral and centroidal axes of the 
straight beam are coincident. However, in 
a curved beam the neutral axis is shifted 
towards the centre of curvature. 
 (ii) The bending stresses in a straight beam vary 
linearly with the distance from the neutral 
axis. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.5. However 
in curved beams, the stress distribution is 
hyperbolic. 
The following notations are used in Fig. 4.64: 
 
Ro = radius of outer ﬁ bre (mm)
 
Ri = radius of inner ﬁ bre (mm)
 
R = radius of centroidal axis (mm)
 
RN = radius of neutral axis (mm)
 
hi = distance of inner ﬁ bre from neutral axis  
 
  (mm)
 
ho = distance of outer ﬁ bre from neutral axis  
 
  (mm)
 
Mb = bending moment with respect to   
 
  centroidal axis (N-mm)
 
A = area of the cross-section (mm2)
The eccentricity e between centroidal and 
neutral axes is given by,
 
 e = R – RN  
(4.54)
The bending stress (s b) at a ﬁ bre, which is at a 
distance of y from the neutral axis is given by,

The

Fig. 4.64 Stresses in Curved Beam  (C.A. = centroidal axis; N.A. = neutral axis)
In symmetrical cross-sections, such as circular 
or rectangular, the maximum bending stress always 
occurs at the inner ﬁ bre. In unsymmetrical cross-
sections, it is necessary to calculate the stresses 
at the inner as well as outer ﬁ bres to determine 
the maximum stress. In most of the engineering 
problems, the magnitude of e is very small and 
it should be calculated precisely to avoid a 
large percentage error in the ﬁ nal results. The 
nomenclature for commonly used cross-sections of 
curved beams is illustrated in Fig. 4.65.

4.23 THERMAL STRESSES
When a machine component is subjected to 
change in temperature, it expands or contracts. 
If the machine component is allowed to expand 
or contract freely, no stresses are induced in 
the component. However, if the expansion or 
contraction of the component is restricted, stresses 
are induced in the component. Such stresses, which 
are caused due to variation in temperature, are 
called thermal stresses. 
Consider a rod of length l as shown in
Fig. 4.69(a). It is assembled at room temperature 
and does not have any provision for axial 
expansion. When the rod is free as shown in
Fig. 4.69(b) and the temperature increases by an 
amount DT, the expansion of the rod is given by,
 
d = a l DT 
(4.68)
where,
 d = expansion of the rod (mm)
 
l = length of rod (mm)
 
a = coefﬁ cient of thermal expansion (per °C)
 
DT = temperature rise (°C) 
The strain e is given by,

D
\ 
e = a DT 
(4.69)
The thermal stress is given by,
 
s = E e = Ea DT
\ 
s = – aEDT 
(4.70)
where,
 E = modulus of elasticity (N/mm2)
Fig. 4.69 Thermal Stresses
Figure 4.69(c) shows the bar which is forced 
to its original length l by means of an imaginary 
thermal force P. It shows that when longitudinal 
expansion is prevented, stress is developed which 
elastically compresses the rod by the amount d = le.
136 Design of Machine Elements
Since the stress is compressive, a negative sign is 
introduced in Eq. (4.70).
We have considered the expansion of the rod 
in one direction and derived Eq. (4.70). A similar 
procedure can be extended to a ﬂ at plate prevented 
from expansion in its plane in the x and y directions. 
It can be proved that for two-directional expansion 
of the plate, the stress equation is given by,
 
s

The thermal stresses are important in design

compound cylinders, pipelines, parts of internal 
combustion 
engines 
and 
steam 
engineering 
equipment. Such stresses are relieved in certain 
applications by using expansion joints or sliding 
supports.
Example 4.22 A hollow steel tube is assembled 
at 25°C with ﬁ xed ends as shown in Fig. 4.70(a). At 
this temperature, there is no stress in the tube. The 
length and cross–sectional area of the tube are 200 
mm and 300 mm2 respectively. During operating 
conditions, the temperature of the tube increases to 
250°C. It is observed that at this temperature, the 
ﬁ xed ends are separated by 0.15 mm as shown in Fig. 
4.70 (b). The modulus of elasticity and coefﬁ cient of 
thermal expansion of steel are 207 000 N/mm2 and 
10.8 ¥ 10–6 per °C respectively. Calculate the force 
acting on the tube and the resultant stress.
Solution 
Given DT = (250 – 25)°C  A = 300 mm2 
l = 200 mm E = 207 000 N/mm2 
a = 10.8 ¥ 10–6 per °C

4.24 RESIDUAL STRESSES
Stresses can be classiﬁ ed into two groups, viz., load 
stresses and residual stresses. Residual stresses are 
also called internal stresses or locked-in stresses. 
Load stresses are those stresses which remain 
within the elastic limit and which are induced by 
external forces. Load stresses return to zero when 
the external forces are removed. Such stresses 
can be calculated by equations from Strength of 
Materials. Residual stresses are those stresses that 
Design against Static Load 137
are independent of external forces. They are usually 
induced as a result of manufacturing processes and 
assembly operations. When the machine component 
with residual stresses is put into service, the load 
stresses are superimposed on the residual stress. 
Residual stresses may be harmful or beneﬁ cial. If 
the residual stresses add to the load stresses, they 
are harmful. On the other hand, if residual stresses 
are opposite to load stresses and subtract, they are 
beneﬁ cial. The residual stresses are induced due to 
the following factors:
 
(i) manufacturing processes like casting and 
forging,
 (ii) machining methods like turning, milling and 
grinding,
 (iii) rolling, extrusion and cold working processes,
 (iv) chemical processes like oxidation, corrosion 
and electroplating,
 (v) heat treatment processes like quenching, and
 (vi) assembly 
operations 
involving 
some 
misalignment.
It is observed that it is practically difﬁ cult to 
avoid residual stresses in any component. 
It is very important to consider residual stresses 
when the component is subjected to ﬂ uctuating 
stresses and failure occurs due to fatigue. Residual 
stresses may either improve the endurance limit of 
the component or affect it adversely. The growth 
of fatigue crack is due to tensile stresses. If the 
residual stresses in the surface of the component 
are compressive, the growth of a fatigue crack 
is retarded and the endurance limit is improved. 
Therefore, residual compressive stresses are 
purposely induced in the surface of components 
subjected to fatigue loading. Such parts are 
subjected to the shot peening process, which 
build compressive stresses into the surface of the 
component. This improves the endurance limit of 
the component. Residual stresses are also beneﬁ cial 
in some applications like compound cylinders and 
press-ﬁ tted or shrink-ﬁ tted assemblies.

The above equations are called elementary 
equations. These equations are based on a number 
of assumptions. One of the assumptions is that there 
are no discontinuities in the cross-section of the 
component. However, in practice, discontinuities 
and abrupt changes in cross-section are unavoidable 
due to certain features of the component such 
as oil holes and grooves, keyways and splines, 
screw threads and shoulders. Therefore, it cannot 
be assumed that the cross-section of the machine 
component is uniform. Under these circumstances, 
the ‘elementary’ equations do not give correct 
results.
A plate with a small circular hole, subjected to 
tensile stress is shown in Fig. 5.1. The distribution 
of stresses near the hole can be observed by using 
the Photo-elasticity technique. In this method, an 
identical model of the plate is made of epoxy resin. 
The model is placed in a circular polariscope and 
loaded at the edges. It is observed that there is 
a sudden rise in the magnitude of stresses in the 
vicinity of the hole. The localized stresses in the 
neighbourhood of the hole are far greater than the 
stresses obtained by elementary equations. 
Fig. 5.1 Stress Concentration
Stress concentration is deﬁ ned as the localization 
of high stresses due to the irregularities present in 
the component and abrupt changes of the cross-
section.
In order to consider the effect of stress 
concentration and ﬁ nd out localized stresses, a 
factor called stress concentration factor is used. It is 
denoted by Kt and deﬁ ned as,
Kt =

 (5.1)
where s0 and to are stresses determined by elementary 
equations and smax. and tmax. are localized stresses 
at the discontinuities. The subscript t denotes 
the ‘theoretical’ stress concentration factor. The 
magnitude of stress concentration factor depends 
upon the geometry of the component.
The causes of stress concentration are as 
follows:
(i) Variation in Properties of Materials In 
design of machine components, it is assumed 
that the material is homogeneous throughout 
the component. In practice, there is variation in 
material properties from one end to another due to 
the following factors:
 
(a) internal cracks and ﬂ aws like blow holes;
 
(b) cavities in welds;
 
(c) air holes in steel components; and
 
(d) nonmetallic or foreign inclusions.
These variations act as discontinuities in the 
component and cause stress concentration.
(ii) Load Application Machine components are 
subjected to forces. These forces act either at a point 
or over a small area on the component. Since the area 
is small, the pressure at these points is excessive. 
This results in stress concentration. The examples of 
these load applications are as follows:
 
(a) Contact between the meshing teeth of the 
driving and the driven gear
 
(b) Contact between the cam and the follower
 
(c) Contact between the balls and the races of 
ball bearing
 
(d) Contact between the rail and the wheel
 
(e) Contact between the crane hook and the 
chain
In all these cases, the concentrated load is 
applied over a very small area resulting in stress 
concentration.
(iii) Abrupt Changes in Section In order to 
mount gears, sprockets, pulleys and ball bearings 
on a transmission shaft, steps are cut on the 
shaft and shoulders are provided from assembly
considerations. 
Although 
these 
features 
are
essential, they create change of the cross-section
of the shaft. This results in stress concentration at 
these cross-sections.
(iv) Discontinuities in the Component Certain 
features of machine components such as oil holes or 
oil grooves, keyways and splines, and screw threads 
result in discontinuities in the cross-section of the 
component. There is stress concentration in the 
vicinity of these discontinuities.
(v) Machining Scratches Machining scratches, 
stamp marks or inspection marks are surface 
irregularities, which cause stress concentration.
5.2 STRESS CONCENTRATION 
FACTORS
The stress concentration factors are determined by 
two methods, viz., the mathematical method based on 
the theory of elasticity and experimental methods like 
photo-elas ticity. For simple geometric shapes, the 
stress concentration factors are determined by photo-
elasticity. The charts for stress concentration factors 
for different geometric shapes and conditions of 
loading were originally developed by RE Peterson1. 
At present, FEA packages are used to ﬁ nd out the 
stress concentration factor for any geometric shape.
The chart for the stress concentration factor for 
a rectangular plate with a transverse hole loaded in 
tension or compression is shown in Fig. 5.2. The

In practice, there are a number of geometric 
shapes and conditions of loading. A separate chart 
for the stress concentration factor should be used for 
each case.
It is possible to ﬁ nd out the stress concentration 
factor for some simple geometric shapes using the 
Theory of elasticity. A ﬂ at plate with an elliptical 
hole and subjected to tensile force, is shown in
Fig. 5.7. It can be proved using the Theory of 
elasticity that the theoretical stress concentration 
factor at the edge of hole is given by,

As b approaches zero, the ellipse becomes sharper 
and sharper. A very sharp crack is indicated and the 
stress at the edge of the crack becomes very large. It 
is observed from Eq. (5.7) that,
 Kt = •  when b = 0
Therefore, as the width of the elliptical hole in 
the direction of the load approaches zero, the stress 
concentration factor becomes inﬁ nity.
The ellipse becomes a circle when (a = b).

Therefore, the theoretical stress concentration

which is subjected to tensile force, is 3.
Design against Fluctuating Load 145
The stress concentration charts are based on 
either the photo-elastic analysis of the epoxy 
models using a circular polariscope or theoretical 
or ﬁ nite element analysis of the mathematical 
model. That is why the factor is called theoretical 
stress concentration factor. The model is made 
of a different material than the actual material of 
the component. The ductility or brittleness of the 
material has a pronounced effect on its response 
to stress concentration. Also, the type of load—
whether static or cyclic—affects the severity of 
stress concentration. Therefore, there is a difference 
between the stress concentration indicated by the 
theoretical stress concentration factor and the 
actual stress concentration in the component. The 
designer should consider the following guidelines:
(i) Ductile Materials Under Static Load Under 
a static load, ductile materials are not affected by 
stress concentration, to the extent that photo-elastic 
analysis might indicate. When the stress in the 
vicinity of the discon tinuity reaches the yield point, 
there is plastic deformation, resulting in a redistribu-
tion of stresses. This plastic deformation or yielding 
is local and restricted to a very small area in the 
component. There is no perceptible damage to the 
part as a whole. Therefore, it is common practice to 
ignore the theoretical stress concentration factor for 
components that are made of ductile materials and 
subjected to static load.
(ii) Ductile Materials Under Fluctuating Load 
However, when the load is ﬂ uctuating, the stress at 
the discontinuities may exceed the endurance limit 
and in that case, the component may fail by fatigue. 
Therefore, endurance limit of the components 
made of ductile material is greatly reduced due to 
stress concentration. This accounts for the use of 
stress concentration factors for ductile components. 
However, some materials are more sensitive than 
others to stress raising notches under a ﬂ uctuating 
load. To account for this effect, a parameter called 
notch sensitivity factor is found for each material. 
The notch sensitivity factor is used to modify the 
theoretical stress concentration factor.
(iii) Brittle Materials The effect of stress 
concentration is more severe in case of brittle 
materials, due to their inability of plastic deformation. 
Brittle materials do not yield locally and there is 
no readjustment of stresses at the discontinuities. 
Once the local stress at the discontinuity reaches 
the fracture strength, a crack is formed. This 
reduces the material available to resist external load 
and also increases the stress concentration at the 
crack. The part then quickly fails. Therefore, stress 
concentration factors are used for components made 
of brittle materials subjected to both static load as 
well as ﬂ uctuating load. 
5.3  REDUCTION OF STRESS 
CONCENTRATION 
Although it is not possible to completely eliminate 
the effect of stress concentration, there are methods 
to reduce stress concentrations. This is achieved by 
providing a speciﬁ c geometric shape to the component. 
In order to know what happens at the abrupt change 
of cross-section or at the discontinuity and reduce the 
stress concentration, understanding of ﬂ ow analogy 
is useful. There is a similarity between velocity 
distribution in ﬂ uid ﬂ ow in a channel and the stress 
distribution in an axially loaded plate shown in Fig. 5.8. 
The equations of ﬂ ow potential in ﬂ uid mechanics and 
stress potential in solid mechanics are same. Therefore, 
it is perfectly logical to use ﬂ uid analogy to understand 
the phenomena of stress concentration.

Sharp Corner (b) Force Flow around Rounded 
Corner
When the cross-section of a channel has uniform 
dimensions throughout, the velocities are uniform 
and the streamlines are equally spaced. The ﬂ ow at 
any cross-section within the channel is given by,

When the cross-section of the plate has the same 
dimensions throughout, the stresses are uniform 
and stress lines are equally spaced. The stress at any 
section is given by,
 
P

= Ú s
 
 (b)
When the cross-section of the channel is suddenly 
reduced, the velocity increases in order to maintain the 
same ﬂ ow and the streamlines become narrower and 
narrower and crowd together. A similar phenomenon 
is observed in a stressed plate. In order to transmit the 
same force, the stress lines come closer and closer 
as the cross-section is reduced. At the change of 
cross-section, the streamlines as well as stress lines 
bend. When there is sudden change in cross-section, 
bending of stress lines is very sharp and severe 
resulting in stress concentration. Therefore, stress 
concentration can be greatly reduced by reducing 
the bending by rounding the corners. Streamlined 
shapes are used in channels to reduce turbulence

(c) Drilled Holes (d) Removal of Undesirable Material
and resistance to ﬂ ow. Streamlining, or rounding 
the counters of mechanical components, has similar 
beneﬁ cial effects in reducing stress concentration. 
There are different methods to reduce the bending of 
the stress lines at the junction and reduce the stress 
concentration.
In practice, reduction of stress concentration is 
achieved by the following methods:
(i) Additional Notches and Holes in Tension 
Member A ﬂ at plate with a V-notch subjected to 
tensile force is shown in Fig. 5.9(a). It is observed 
that a single notch results in a high degree of stress 
concentration. The severity of stress concentration 
is reduced by three methods: (a) use of multiple 
notches; (b) drilling additional holes; and (c) 
removal of undesired material. These methods are 
illustrated in Fig. 5.9(b), (c) and (d) respectively. The 
method of removing undesired material is called the 
principle of minimization of the material. In these 
three methods, the sharp bending of a force ﬂ ow line 
is reduced and it follows a smooth curve.
(ii) Fillet Radius, Undercutting and Notch for 
Member in Bending A bar of circular cross-section 
with a shoulder and subjected to bending moment is 
shown in Fig. 5.10(a). Ball bearings, gears or pulleys 
are seated against this shoulder. The shoulder creates 
a change in cross-section of the shaft, which results 
in stress concentration. There are three methods 
to reduce stress concentration at the base of this 
shoulder. Figure 5.10(b) shows the shoulder with a 
ﬁ llet radius r. This results in gradual transition from 
small diameter to a large diameter. The ﬁ llet radius 
should be as large as possible in order to reduce 
stress concentration. In practice, the ﬁ llet radius 
is limited by the design of mating components. 
Design against Fluctuating Load 147
The ﬁ llet radius can be increased by undercutting 
the shoulder as illustrated in Fig. 5.10(c). A notch 
results 
in 
stress 
concentration. 
Surprisingly, 
cutting an additional notch is an effective way to 
reduce stress concentration. This is illustrated in
Fig. 5.10(d).

(b) Fillet Radius (c) Undercutting (d) Addition of Notch
(iii) Drilling Additional Holes for Shaft A 
transmission shaft with a keyway is shown in Fig. 
5.11(a). The keyway is a discontinuity and results 
in stress concentration at the corners of the keyway 
and reduces torsional shear strength. An empirical 
relationship developed by HF Moore for the ratio 
C of torsional strength of a shaft having a keyway 
to torsional strength of a same sized shaft without a 
keyway is given by

where w and h are width and height dimensions of 
the keyway respectively and d is the shaft diameter. 
The four corners of the keyway, viz., m1, m2, n1 and 
n2 are shown in Fig. 5.11(c). It has been observed 
that torsional shear stresses at two points, viz. 
m1 and m2 are negligibly small in practice and 
theoretically equal to zero. On the other hand, the 
torsional shear stresses at two points, viz., n1 and n2 
are excessive and theoretically inﬁ nite which means 
even a small torque will produce a permanent set at 
these points. Rounding corners at two points, viz., 
n1 and n2 by means of a ﬁ llet radius can reduce the 
stress concentration. A stress concentration factor 
Kt = 3 should be used when a shaft with a keyway 
is subjected to combined bending and torsional 
moments.
In addition to giving ﬁ llet radius at the inner 
corners of the keyway, there is another method of 
drilling two symmetrical holes on the sides of the 
keyway. These holes press the force ﬂ ow lines and 
minimise their bending in the vicinity of the keyway. 
This method is illustrated in Fig. 5.11(b).

(iv) Reduction of Stress Concentration in Threaded 
Members A threaded component is shown in
Fig. 5.12 (a). It is observed that the force ﬂ ow line is 
bent as it passes from the shank portion to threaded 
portion of the component. This results in stress 
concentration in the transition plane. In Fig. 5.12(b), 
a small undercut is taken between the shank and the 
threaded portion of the component and a ﬁ llet radius 
is provided for this undercut. This reduces bending 
of the force ﬂ ow line and consequently reduces 
stress concentration. An ideal method to reduce 
stress concentration is illustrated in Fig. 5.12(c), 
where the shank diameter is reduced and made 
equal to the core diameter of the thread. In this case, 
the force ﬂ ow line is almost straight and there is no 
stress concentration.
Many 
discontinuities 
found 
in 
machine 
components cannot be avoided. Therefore, stress 
concentration cannot be totally eliminated. However, 
it can be greatly reduced by selecting the correct 
geometric shape by the designer. Many difﬁ cult 
problems involving stress concentration have been 
solved by removing material instead of adding it. 
Additional notches, holes and undercuts are the 
simple means to achieve signiﬁ cant reduction in 
stress concentration.
Example 5.1 A ﬂ at plate subjected to a tensile 
force of 5 kN is shown in Fig. 5.13. The plate 
material is grey cast iron FG 200 and the factor of

5.4 FLUCTUATING STRESSES
In the previous chapters, the external forces acting 
on a machine component were as sumed to be static. 
150 Design of Machine Elements
In many applications, the components are subjected 
to forces, which are not static, but vary in magnitude 
with respect to time. The stresses induced due 
to such forces are called ﬂ uctuating stres ses. It is 
observed that about 80% of failures of mechanical 
components are due to ‘fatigue failure’ resulting 
from ﬂ uctuating stresses. In practice, the pattern of 
stress variation is irregular and unpredictable, as in 
case of stresses due to vibrations. For the purpose 
of design analysis, simple models for stress–time 
relationships are used. The most popular model for 
stress–time relationship is the sine curve.
There are three types of mathematical models for 
cyclic stresses—ﬂ uctuating or alternating stresses, 
repeated stresses and reversed stresses. Stress–time 
relationships for these models are illustrated in Fig. 
5.15. The ﬂ uctuating or alternating stress varies in a 
sinusoidal manner with respect to time. It has some 
mean value as well as amplitude value. It ﬂ uctuates 
between two limits—maximum and minimum 
stress. The stress can be tensile or compressive or 
partly tensile and partly compressive. The repeated 
stress varies in a sinusoidal manner with respect 
to time, but the variation is from zero to some 
maximum value. The minimum stress is zero in 
this case and therefore, amplitude stress and mean 
stress are equal. The reversed stress varies in a 
sinusoidal manner with respect to time, but it has 
zero mean stress. In this case, half portion of the 
cycle consists of tensile stress and the remaining half 
of compressive stress. There is a complete reversal 
from tension to compression between these two 
halves and therefore, the mean stress is zero. In Fig. 
5.15, smax. and smin. are maximum and minimum 
stresses, while sm and sa are called mean stress and 
stress amplitude respectively. It can be proved that,

In the analysis of ﬂ uctuating stresses, tensile stress 
is considered as positive, while compressive stress 
as negative. It can be observed that repeated stress 
and reversed stress are special cases of ﬂ uctuating 
stress with (smin. = 0) and (sm = 0) respectively.

5.5 FATIGUE FAILURE
It has been observed that materials fail under 
ﬂ uctuating stresses at a stress magnitude which 
is lower than the ultimate tensile strength of the 
material. Sometimes, the magnitude is even lower 
than the yield strength. Further, it has been found 
that the magnitude of the stress causing fatigue 
failure decreases as the number of stress cycles 
increase. This phenomenon of decreased resistance 
of the materials to ﬂ uctuating stresses is the main 
characteristic of fatigue failure.
Let us examine a phenomenon we have 
experienced in our childhood. Suppose, there is a 
wire of 2 to 3 mm diameter and we want to cut it 
into two pieces without any device like a hacksaw. 
One method is to shear the wire by applying equal 
and opposite forces P1 and P2 by left and right hands

Fig. 5.16 
Shear and Fatigue Failure of Wire:
(a) Shearing of Wire (b) Bending of Wire
(c) Unbending of Wire
 as illustrated in Fig. 5.16(a). It is difﬁ cult to cut the 
wire by this method. The second method consists of 
alternatively bending and unbending the wire for few 
cycles. Let us consider two diametrically opposite 
points A and B on the surface of the wire. As shown 
in Fig. 5.16(b), when the wire is bent, A is subjected 
to tensile stress while B to compressive stress. When 
the wire is unbent, there is compressive stress at A 
and tensile stress at B, as shown in Fig. 5.16(c). 
Therefore, there is complete reversal of stress from 
tensile stress to compressive stress at the point A 
due to alternate bending and unbending. Similarly, 
the point B is subjected to reversal of stress from 
compressive stress to tensile stress during the same 
cycle. We have experienced that the wire can be cut 
very easily in few cycles of bending and unbending. 
This is a fatigue failure and the magnitude of stress 
required to fracture is very low. In other words, there 
is decreased resistance of material to cyclic stresses. 
Fatigue failure is deﬁ ned as time delayed fracture 
under cyclic loading. Examples of parts in which 
fatigue failures are common are transmission shafts, 
connecting rods, gears, vehicle suspension springs 
and ball bearings.
There is a basic difference between failure due to 
static load and that due to fatigue. The failure due to 
static load is illustrated by the simple tension test. In 
this case, the load is gradually applied and there is 
sufﬁ cient time for the elongation of ﬁ bres. In ductile 
materials, there is considerable plastic ﬂ ow prior to 
fracture. This results in a silky ﬁ brous structure due 
to the stretching of crystals at the fractured surface. 
On the other hand, fatigue failure begins with a 
crack at some point in the material. The crack is 
more likely to occur in the following regions:
 
(i) Regions of discontinuity, such as oil holes, 
keyways, screw threads, etc.
 
(ii) Regions of irregularities in machining 
operations, such as scratches on the surface, 
stamp mark, inspection marks, etc.
 (iii) Internal cracks due to defects in materials 
like blow holes
These regions are subjected to stress concentration 
due to the crack. The crack spreads due to ﬂ uctuating 
stresses, until the cross-section of the component is 
so reduced that the remaining portion is subjected 
to sudden fracture. There are two distinct areas of 
fatigue failure—(i) region indicating slow growth of 
crack with a ﬁ ne ﬁ brous appearance, and (ii) region of 
sudden fracture with a coarse granular appearance.
In case of failure under static load, there is 
sufﬁ cient plastic deformation prior to failure, which 
gives a warning well in advance. On the other 
hand, fatigue cracks are not visible till they reach 
the surface of the component and by that time, the 
failure has already taken place. The fatigue failure 
is sudden and total. It is relatively easy to design 
152 Design of Machine Elements
a component for a static load. The fatigue failure, 
however, depends upon a number of factors, such as 
the number of cycles, mean stress, stress amplitude, 
stress concentration, residual stresses, corrosion 
and creep. This makes the design of components 
subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses more complex.
5.6 ENDURANCE LIMIT
The fatigue or endurance limit of a material is 
deﬁ ned as the maximum amplitude of completely 
reversed stress that the standard specimen can 
sustain for an unlimited number of cycles without 
fatigue failure. Since the fatigue test cannot be 
conducted for unlimited or inﬁ nite number of 
cycles, 106 cycles is considered as a sufﬁ cient 
number of cycles to deﬁ ne the endurance limit. 
There is another term called fatigue life, which is 
frequently used with endurance limit. The fatigue 
life is deﬁ ned as the number of stress cycles that 
the standard specimen can complete during the test 
before the appearance of the ﬁ rst fatigue crack. The 
dimensions of the standard test specimen (in mm) 
are shown in Fig. 5.17. The specimen is carefully 
machined and polished. The ﬁ nal polishing is done
Fig. 5.17 Specimen for Fatigue Test
in axial direction in order to avoid circumferential 
scratches. In the laboratory, the endurance limit is 
determined by means of a rotating beam machine 
developed by R R Moore. The principle of a rotating 
beam is illustrated in Fig. 5.18. A beam of circular 
cross-section is subjected to bending moment 
Mb. Under the action of bending moment, tensile 
stresses are induced in the upper half of the beam 
and compressive stresses in the lower half. The 
maximum tensile stress st in the uppermost ﬁ bre 
is equal to the maximum compressive stress sc in 
the lowermost ﬁ bre. There is zero stress at all ﬁ bres 
in the central horizontal plane passing through the 
axis of the beam. Let us consider a point A on the 
surface of the beam and let us try to ﬁ nd out stresses 
at this point when the shaft is rotated through one 
revolution. Initially, the point A occupies position 
A1 in the central horizontal plane with zero stress. 
When the shaft is rotated through 90°, it occupies the 
position A2. It is subjected to maximum tensile stress 
st in this position. When the shaft is further rotated 
through 90°, the point A will occupy the position 
A3 in the central horizontal plane with zero stress. A 
further rotation of 90° will bring the point A to the 
position A4. It is subjected to maximum compressive 
stress sc in this position. The variation of stresses 
at the point A during one revolution of the beam is 
shown in Fig. 5.18(b). It is observed that the beam 
is subjected to completely reversed stresses with 
tensile stress in the ﬁ rst half and compressive stress 
in the second half. The distribution is sinusoidal and 
one stress cycle is completed in one revolution. The 
amplitude of this cycle (st or sc) is given by

 or

The amplitude can be increased or decreased 
by increasing or decreasing the bending moment 
respectively.
 Fig. 5.18 Rotating Beam Subjected to Bending Moment: 
(a) Beam, (b) Stress Cycle at Point A
A schematic diagram of a rotating beam fatigue 
testing machine is shown in Fig. 5.19. The specimen 
acts as a ‘rotating beam’ subjected to a bending 
moment. Therefore, it is subjected to a completely 
Design against Fluctuating Load 153
reversed stress cycle. Changing the bending 
moment by addition or deletion of weights can vary 
the stress amplitude. The specimen is rotated by an 
electric motor. The number of revolutions before 
the appearance of the ﬁ rst fatigue crack is recorded 
on a revolution counter. In each test, two readings 
are taken, viz., stress amplitude (Sf) and number of 
stress cycles (N). These readings are used as two co-
ordinates for plotting a point on the S–N diagram. 
This point is called failure point. To determine the 
endurance limit of a material, a number of tests are 
to be carried out.
Fig. 5.19 Rotaing Beam Fatigue Testing Machine
The results of these tests are plotted by means 
of an S–N curve. The S–N curve is the graphical 
representation of stress amplitude (Sf  ) versus the 
number of stress cycles (N) before the fatigue failure 
on a log-log graph paper. The S–N curve for steels 
is illustrated in Fig. 5.20. Each test on the fatigue 
testing machine gives one failure point on the S–N 
diagram. In practice, the points are scattered in the 
ﬁ gure and an average curve is drawn through them. 
The S–N diagram is also called Wöhler diagram, after 
August Wöhler, a German engineer who published 
his fatigue research in 1870. The S–N diagram is a 
standard method of presenting fatigue data.
Fig. 5.20 S-N Curve for Steels
For ferrous materials like steels, the S–N curve 
becomes asymptotic at 106 cycles, which indicates 
the stress amplitude corresponding to inﬁ nite 
number of stress cycles. The magnitude of this stress 
amplitude at 10 6 cycles represents the endurance 
limit of the material. The S–N curve shown in
Fig. 5.20 is valid only for ferrous metals. For non-
ferrous metals like aluminium alloys, the S–N 
curve slopes gradually even after 106 cycles. These 
materials do not exhibit a distinct value of the 
endurance limit in a true sense. For these materials, 
endurance limit stress is sometimes expressed as a 
function of the number of stress cycles. 
The endurance limit, in a true sense, is not 
exactly a property of material like ultimate tensile 
strength. It is affected by factors such as the size 
of the component, shape of component, the surface 
ﬁ nish, temperature and the notch sensitivity of the 
material.
5.7 LOW-CYCLE AND HIGH-CYCLE 
FATIGUE
The S–N curve illustrated in Fig. 5.20 is drawn from 
103 cycles on a log-log graph paper. The complete 
S–N curve from 100 cycle to 108 cycles is shown 
in Fig. 5.21. There are two regions of this curve 
namely, low-cycle fatigue and high-cycle fatigue. 
The difference between these two fatigue failures is 
as follows:
 
(i) Any fatigue failure when the number of 
stress cycles are less than 1000, is called 
154 Design of Machine Elements
low-cycle fatigue. Any fatigue failure when 
the number of stress cycles are more than 
1000, is called high-cycle fatigue.
 
(ii) Failure of studs on truck wheels, failure 
of setscrews for locating gears on shafts 
or failures of short-lived devices such as 
missiles are the examples of low-cycle 
fatigue. The failure of machine components 
such as springs, ball bearings or gears that 
are subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses, are the 
examples of high-cycle fatigue.
 (iii) The low-cycle fatigue involves plastic 
yielding at localized areas of the components. 
There are some theories of low-cycle fatigue. 
However, in many applications, the designers 
simply ignore the fatigue effect when the 
number of stress cycles are less than 1000. A 
greater factor of safety is used to account for 
this effect. Such components are designed on 
the basis of ultimate tensile strength or yield 
strength with a suitable factor of safety.
Components subjected to high-cycle fatigue are 
designed on the basis of endurance limit stress. S–N 
curves, Soderberg lines, Gerber lines or Goodman 
diagrams are used in the design of such components.
The discussion in this chapter is restricted to 
high-cycle fatigue failure of machine elements.
Fig. 5.21 Low and High Cycle Fatigue
5.8 NOTCH SENSITIVITY
It is observed that the actual reduction in the 
endurance limit of a material due to stress 
concentration is less than the amount indicated 
by the theoretical stress concentration factor Kt. 
Therefore, two separate notations, Kt and Kf, are used 
for stress concentration factors. Kt is the theoretical 
stress concentration factor, as deﬁ ned in previous 
sections, which is applicable to ideal materials that 
are homogeneous, isotropic and elastic. Kf is the 
fatigue stress concentration factor, which is deﬁ ned 
as follows:
K f = Endurance limit of the notch free specimen
Endurance limit of the notched specimen
This factor Kf is applicable to actual materials 
and depends upon the grain size of the material. 
It is observed that there is a greater reduction in 
the endurance limit of ﬁ ne-grained materials as 
compared to coarse-grained materials, due to stress 
concentration.
Notch sensitivity is deﬁ ned as the susceptibility 
of a material to succumb to the damaging effects of 
stress raising notches in fatigue loading. The notch 
sensitivity factor q is deﬁ ned as
q = Increase of actual stress over nominal stress
Increase of theoretical stress over
nominal stress
Since

equations

The above equation can be rearranged in the 
following form:

 (5.12)
The following conclusions are drawn with the 
help of Eq. (5.12).
 
(i) When the material has no sensitivity to 
notches,
 
q = 0 
and 
Kf = 1
 
(ii) When the material is fully sensitive to 
notches,
 
q = 1 
and 
Kf = Kt
In general, the magnitude of the notch sensitivity 
factor q varies from 0 to 1. The notch sensitivity 
factors for various materials for reversed bending or 
axial stresses and reversed torsional shear stresses2 
are obtained from Fig. 5.22 and 5.23 respectively. In 
case of doubt, the designer should use (q = 1) or (Kt 
= Kf) and the design will be on the safe side.
 5.9 
ENDURANCE LIMIT—
APPROXIMATE ESTIMATION
The laboratory method for determining the endurance 
limit of materials, although more precise, is laborious 
and time consuming. A number of tests are required 
to prepare one S–N curve and each test takes 
considerable time. It is, therefore, not possible to get 
the experimental data of each and every material. 
When the laboratory data regarding the endurance 
limit of the materials is not available, the procedure 
discussed in this article should be adopted.
Two separate notations are used for endurance 
limit, viz, (S ¢e) and (Se) where,
S¢e = endurance limit stress of a rotating beam 
specimen subjected to reversed bending stress
(N/mm2)
 2 George Sines and J L Waisman, Metal Fatigue—McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., 1959 and University of California 
(Engineering Extension Series), Article No. 13, Notch Sensitivity by R E Peterson. 
156 Design of Machine Elements
Se = endurance limit stress of a particular mechanical 
component subjected to reversed bending stress 
(N/mm2)
There is an approximate relationship between 
the endurance limit and the ultimate tensile strength 
(Sut) of the material.
For steels,
 
S¢e = 0.5 Sut 
 (5.13)
For cast iron and cast steels,
 
S¢e = 0.4 Sut 
 (5.14)
For wrought aluminium alloys,
 
 S¢e = 0.4 Sut 
 (5.15)
For cast aluminium alloys,
 
 S¢e = 0.3 Sut 
 (5.16)
These relationships are based on 50% reliability.
The endurance limit of a component is different 
from the endurance limit of a rotating beam specimen 
due to a number of factors. The difference arises due 
to the fact that there are standard speciﬁ cations and 
working conditions for the rotating beam specimen, 
while the actual components have different 
speciﬁ cations and work under different condi tions. 
Different modifying factors are used in practice 
to account for this difference. These factors are, 
sometimes, called derating factors. The purpose of 
derating factors is to ‘derate’ or reduce the endurance 
limit of a rotating beam specimen to suit the actual 
component. In this article, only four factors that 
normally require attention are discussed. 
The relationship between (Se) and (S¢e) is as 
follows3:
 
Se = Ka Kb Kc Kd S¢e  
(5.17)
where,
Ka = surface ﬁ nish factor
Kb = size factor
Kc = reliability factor
Kd = modifying factor to account for stress  
 
concentration.
(i) Surface ﬁ nish Factor The surface of the rotating 
beam specimen is polished to mirror ﬁ nish. The 
ﬁ nal polishing is carried out in the axial direction to 
smooth out any circumferential scratches. This makes 
the specimen almost free from surface scratches and 
imperfections. It is impractical to provide such an 
expensive surface ﬁ nish for the actual component. 
The actual component may not even require such 
a surface ﬁ nish. When the surface ﬁ nish is poor, 
there are scratches and geometric irregularities 
on the surface. These surface scratches serve as 
stress raisers and result in stress concentration. The 
endurance limit is reduced due to introduction of 
stress concentration at these scratches. The surface 
ﬁ nish factor takes into account the reduction in 
endurance limit due to the variation in the surface 
ﬁ nish between the specimen and the actual 
component. Figure 5.24 shows the surface ﬁ nish 
factor for steel components4. It should be noted that 
ultimate tensile strength is also a parameter affecting 
the surface ﬁ nish factor. High strength materials are 
more sensitive to stress concentration introduced 
by surface irregularities. Therefore, as the ultimate 
tensile strength increases, the surface ﬁ nish factor 
decreases.

Design against Fluctuating Load 157
Shigley and Mischke have suggested an 
exponential equation for the surface ﬁ nish factor. 
This equation is based on experimental data points 
obtained by Noll and Lipson. This equation is in the 
following form,
 
 Ka = a(Sut)b  [if Ka > 1, set Ka = 1] 
(5.18)
The values of coefﬁ cients a and b are given in 
Table 5.1.

The above mentioned values of surface ﬁ nish 
factors are developed only for steel components. 
They should not be applied to components made of 
other ductile materials like aluminium alloys. 
The surface ﬁ nish factor for ordinary grey cast 
iron components is taken as 1, irrespective of their 
surface ﬁ nish. It is observed that even mirror-
ﬁ nished samples of grey cast iron parts have surface 
discontinuities because of graphite ﬂ akes in the cast 
iron matrix. Adding some more surface scratches 
does not make any difference. Therefore, whatever 
is the machining method; the value of surface ﬁ nish 
factor for cast iron parts is always taken as 1.
In this chapter, the values of surface ﬁ nish factors 
are obtained from Fig. 5.24 instead of Eq. (5.18).
(ii) Size Factor The rotating beam specimen is 
small with 7.5 mm diameter. The larger the machine 
part, the greater the probability that a ﬂ aw exists 
somewhere in the component. The chances of

fatigue failure originating at any one of these ﬂ aws 
are more. The endurance limit, therefore, reduces 
with increasing the size of the component. The 
size factor Kb takes into account the reduction in 
endurance limit due to increase in the size of the 
component. For bending and torsion, the values of 
size factor (Kb) are given in Table 5.2.
Shigley and Mischke have suggested an 
exponential equation for the size factor. For bending 
and torsion, the equation is in the following form:
 
For 2.79 mm £ d < 51 mm
 
Kb = 1.24 d–0.107 
(5.19)
 
For 51 mm < d £ 254 mm
 
Kb = 0.859 – 0.000 873 d 
(5.20)
For axial loading, Kb = 1
In this chapter, Table 5.2 is used instead of Eqs 
(5.19) and (5.20) to ﬁ nd out the value of size factor.
Table 5.2 as well as Eqs (5.19) and (5.20) can be 
used only for cylindrical components. It is difﬁ cult 
to determine the size factor for components having 
a non-circular cross-section. However, since the 
endurance limit is reduced in such components, it 
is necessary to deﬁ ne effective diameter based on 
an equivalent circular cross-section. In this case, 
Kuguel’s equality is widely used. This equality is 
based on the concept that fatigue failure is related 
to the probability of high stress interacting with a 
discontinuity. When the volume of material subjected 
to high stress is large, the probability of fatigue 
failure originating from any ﬂ aw in that volume is 
more. Kuguel assumes a volume of material that is 
stressed to 95% of the maximum stress or above as 
high stress volume. According to Kuguel’s equality, 
the effective diameter is obtained by equating the 
volume of the material stressed at and above 95% 
of the maximum stress to the equivalent volume 
in the rotating beam specimen. When these two 
volumes are equated, the lengths of the component 
and specimen cancel out and only areas need be 
considered. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 5.25. 
The rotating beam specimen is subjected to bending 
stresses. The bending stress is linearly proportional 
to the distance from the centre of the cross-section. 
There is maximum stress at the outer ﬁ bre. Therefore, 
the area (A95) stressed above 95% of the maximum 
stress is the area of a ring, having an inside diameter 
of (0.95d) and an outside diameter of (1.0d).

(iii) Reliability Factor The laboratory values of 
endurance limit are usually mean values. There is 
Design against Fluctuating Load 159
considerable dispersion of the data when a number 
of tests are conducted even using the same material 
and same conditions. The standard deviation of 
endurance limit tests is 8% of the mean value. The 
reliability factor Kc depends upon the reliability that 
is used in the design of the component. The greater 
the likelihood that a part will survive, the more is 
the reliability and lower is the reliability factor. The 
reliability factor is one for 50% reliability. This 
means that 50% of the components will survive in 
the given set of conditions. To ensure that more than 
50% of the parts will survive, the stress amplitude 
on the component should be lower than the tabulated 
value of the endurance limit. The reliability factor is 
used to achieve this reduction. The reliability factors 
based on a standard deviation of 8% are given in 
Table 5.33.

(iv) Modifying Factor to Account for Stress 
Concentration The endurance limit is reduced due 
to stress concentration. The stress concentration 
factor used for cyclic loading is less than the 
theoretical stress concentration factor due to the 
notch sensitivity of the material. To apply the effect 
of stress concentration, the designer can either 
reduce the endurance limit by (Kd) or increase 
the stress amplitude by (Kf). We will use the ﬁ rst 
approach. The modifying factor Kd to account for 
the effect of stress concentration is deﬁ ned as,
 
K
K
d
f
= 1
 
 (5.27)
The above mentioned four factors are used to ﬁ nd 
out the endurance limit of the actual component.
The endurance limit (Sse) of a component 
subjected to ﬂ uctuating torsional shear stresses 
is obtained from the endurance limit in reversed 
bending (Se) using theories of failures.
According to the maximum shear stress theory,
 
Sse = 0.5 Se 
(5.28)
According to distortion energy theory,
 
Sse = 0.577 Se 
(5.29)
When the component is subjected to an axial 
ﬂ uctuating load, the conditions are different. In 
axial loading, the entire cross-section is uniformly 
stressed to the maximum value. In the rotating beam 
test, the specimen is subjected to bending stress. The 
bending stress is zero at the centre of cross-section 
and negligible in the vicinity of centre. It is only the 
outer region near the surface, which is subjected 
to maximum stress. There is more likelihood of a 
microcrack being present in the much higher high-
stress ﬁ eld of axial loading than in the smaller 
volume outer region of the rotating beam specimen. 
Therefore, endurance limit in axial loading is lower 
than the rotating beam test. 
For axial loading,
 
(Se)a = 0.8 Se 
(5.30)
5.10 REVERSED STRESSES—DESIGN FOR 
FINITE AND INFINITE LIFE
There are two types of problems in fatigue design—
(i) components subjected to completely reversed 
stresses, and (ii) components subjected to ﬂ uctuating 
stresses. As shown in Fig. 5.15, the mean stress is 
zero in case of completely reversed stresses. The 
stress distribution consists of tensile stresses for 
the ﬁ rst half cycle and compressive stresses for the 
remaining half cycle and the stress cycle passes 
through zero. In case of ﬂ uctuating stresses, there is 
always a mean stress, and the stresses can be purely 
tensile, purely compressive or mixed depending upon 
the magnitude of the mean stress. Such problems 
are solved with the help of the modiﬁ ed Goodman 
diagram, which will be discussed in Section 5.13.
The design problems for completely reversed 
stresses are further divided into two groups—(i) 
design for inﬁ nite life, and (ii) design for ﬁ nite life. 
Case I: When the component is to be designed 
for inﬁ nite life, the endurance limit becomes the 
160 Design of Machine Elements
criterion of failure. The amplitude stress induced in 
such components should be lower than the endurance 
limit in order to withstand the inﬁ nite number of 
cycles. Such components are designed with the help 
of the following equations:
 
sa
e
S
fs
= (
)  
 (5.31)
 
t a
se
S
fs
= (
)  
 (5.32)
where (sa) and (ta) are stress amplitudes in the 
component and Se and Sse are corrected endurance 
limits in reversed bending and torsion respec tively.
Case II: When the component is to be designed for 
ﬁ nite life, the S–N curve as shown in Fig. 5.27 can 
be used. The curve is valid for steels. It consists of a
Fig. 5.27 S-N Curve
straight line AB drawn from (0.9 Sut) at 103 cycles 
to (Se) at 106 cycles on a log-log paper. The design 
procedure for such problems is as follows:
 
 (i) Locate the point A with coordinates 
 
  [3, log10 (0.9Sut)] since log10(103) = 3
 
(ii) Locate the point B with coordinates
 
 [6, log10 (Se)] since  log10(106) = 6
 (iii) Join AB, which is used as a criterion of 
failure for ﬁ nite-life problems
 (iv) Depending upon the life N of the component, 
draw a vertical line passing through 
log10 (N) on the abscissa. This line intersects 
AB at point F.
 
(v) Draw a line FE parallel to the abscissa. The 
ordinate at the point E, i.e. log10 (Sf), gives 
the fatigue strength corresponding to N 
cycles.
The value of the fatigue strength (Sf) obtained 
by the above procedure is used for the design 
calculations.
Inﬁ nite-life Problems (Reversed Load)

A plate made of steel 20C8
(Sut = 440 N/mm2) in hot rolled and normalised 
condition is shown in Fig. 5.28. It is subjected to 
a completely reversed axial load of 30 kN. The 
notch sensitivity factor q can be taken as 0.8 and 
the expected reliability is 90%. The size factor is 
0.85. The factor of safety is 2. Determine the plate 
thickness for inﬁ nite life.

Finite-life Problems (Reversed Load)
Example 5.6 A rotating bar made of steel 45C8 
(Sut = 630 N/mm2) is subjected to a completely 
reversed bending stress. The corrected endurance 
limit of the bar is 315 N/mm2. Calculate the fatigue

Example 5.8 A rotating shaft, subjected to a non-
rotating force of 5 kN and simply supported between 
two bearings A and E is shown in Fig. 5.32(a). The 
shaft is machined from plain carbon steel 30C8 (Sut 
= 500 N/mm2) and the expected reliability is 90%. 
The equivalent notch radius at the ﬁ llet section can 
be taken as 3 mm. What is the life of the shaft?

Solution
Given P = 5 kN Sut = 500 N/mm2
R = 90% r = 3 mm
Step I Selection of failure-section
Taking the moment of the forces about bearings A 
and E, the reactions at A and E are 2143 and 2857 N 
respectively. The bending moment diagram is shown 
in Fig. 5.32(b). The values of the bending moment 
shown in the ﬁ gure are in N-m. The possibility of 
a failure will be at the three sections B, C and D. 
The failure will probably occur at the section B 
rather than at C or D. At the section C, although the 
bending moment is maximum, the diameter is more 
and there is no stress concentration. At the section 
D, the diameter is more and the bending moment is 
less compared with that of section B. Therefore, it is 
concluded that failure will occur at the section B.

point of 350 MN/m2 and endurance limit in bending 
for a 7.5 mm diameter specimen of 210 MN/m2.

Example 5.10 A cantilever beam made of cold 
drawn steel 20C8 (Sut = 540 N/mm2) is subjected to 
a completely reversed load of 1000 N as shown in 
Fig. 5.36. The notch sensitivity factor q at the ﬁ llet 
can be taken as 0.85 and the expected reliability is 
90%. Determine the diameter d of the beam for a life 
of 10000 cycles.
Fig. 5.36
Solution
Given P = ± 1000 N Sut = 540 N/mm2 
q = 0.85 R = 90% N = 10 000 cycles
Step I Selection of failure section
The failure will occur either at the section A or at 
the section B. At section A, although the bending 
moment is maximum, there is no stress concentration 
and the diameter is also more compared with that 
of the section B. It is, therefore, assumed that the 
failure will occur at the section B.
Step II Construction of S–N diagram
 
S¢e  = 0.5 Sut = 0.5(540) = 270 N/mm2
From Fig. 5.24 (cold drawn steel and Sut =

5.11  CUMULATIVE DAMAGE IN 
FATIGUE
In certain applications, the mechanical component is 
subjected to different stress levels for different parts 
of the work cycle. The life of such a component 
is determined by Miner’s equation. Suppose that 
a component is subjected to complete ly reversed 
stresses (s1) for (n1) cycles, (s2) for (n2) cycles, and 
so on. Let N1 be the number of stress cycles before 
fatigue failure, if only the alternating stress (s1) 
is acting. One stress cycle will consume (1/N1) of 
the fatigue life and since there are n1 such cycles 
at this stress level, the proportionate damage of 
fatigue life will be [(1/N1)nl] or (nl/Nl). Similarly, 
the proportionate damage at stress level (s2) will be 
(n2/N2). Adding these quantities, we get

The above equation is known as Miner’s 
equation. Sometimes, the number of cycles n1, n2,… 
at stress levels s1, s2,… are unknown. Suppose that 
a1, a2,… are proportions of the total life that will be 
consumed by the stress levels s1, s2,… etc. Let N be 
the total life of the component. Then,
n1 = a1 N
n2 = a2 N

With the help of the above equations, the life of 
the component subjected to different stress levels 
can be determined.
Example 5.11 The work cycle of a mechanical 
component subjected to complete ly reversed bending 
stresses consists of the following three elements:
 
(i) ± 350 N/mm2 for 85% of time 
 
(ii) ± 400 N/mm2 for 12% of time
 (iii) ± 500 N/mm2 for 3% of time 
The material for the component is 50C4 (Sut = 
660 N/mm2) and the corrected endurance limit of 
the component is 280 N/mm2. Determine the life of 
the component. 
Solution 
Given Sut = 660 N/mm2 Se = 280 N/mm2 
Step I Construction of S–N diagram
0.9Sut = 0.9(660) = 594 N/mm2
log10 (0.9Sut) = log10 (594) = 2.7738
log10 (Se) = log10 (280) = 2.4472
log10 (s1) = log10 (350) = 2.5441
log10 (s2) = log10 (400) = 2.6021
log10 (s3) = log10 (500) = 2.6990

5.12  SODERBERG AND GOODMAN 
LINES
When a component is subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses 
as shown in Fig. 5.15 (a), there is mean stress (sm) 
as well as stress amplitude (sa). It has been observed 
that the mean stress component has an effect on 
fatigue failure when it is present in combination 
with an alternating component. The fatigue diagram 
for this general case is shown in Fig. 5.39. In this 
diagram, the mean stress is plotted on the abscissa. 
The stress amplitude is plotted on the ordinate. 
The magnitudes of (sm) and (sa) depend upon the 
magnitudes of maximum and minimum force acting 
on the component. When stress amplitude (sa) is 
zero, the load is purely static and the criterion of 
failure is Sut or Syt. These limits are plotted on the 
abscissa. When the mean stress (sm) is zero, the 
stress is completely reversing and the criterion of 
failure is the endurance limit Se that is plotted on the 
ordinate. When the component is subjected to both 
components of stress, viz., (sm) and (sa), the actual 
failure occurs at different scattered points shown in 
the ﬁ gure. There exists a border, which divides safe 
region from unsafe region for various combinations 
of (sm) and (sa). Different criterions are proposed 
to construct the borderline dividing safe zone and 
failure zone. They include Gerber line, Soderberg 
line and Goodman line.
Gerber Line A parabolic curve joining Se on the 
ordinate to Sut on the abscissa is called the Gerber line.
Soderberg Line A straight line joining Se on the 
ordinate to Syt on the abscissa is called the Soderberg 
line.
Goodman Line A straight line joining Se on the 
ordinate to Sut on the abscissa is called the Goodman 
line.
Fig. 5.39 Soderberg and Goodman Lines
The Gerber parabola ﬁ ts the failure points of test 
data in the best possible way. The Goodman line ﬁ ts 
beneath the scatter of this data. Both Gerber parabola 
and Goodman line intersect at (Se) on the ordinate to 
(Sut) on the abscissa. However, the Goodman line 
is more safe from design considerations because it 
is completely inside the Gerber parabola and inside 
the failure points. The Soderberg line is a more 
conservative failure criterion and there is no need 
to consider even yielding in this case. A yield line is 
constructed connecting (Syt) on both axes. It is called 
the limit on ‘ﬁ rst cycle’ of stress. This is because if 
a part yields, it has failed, regardless of its safety in 
fatigue.

 (5.37)
The Goodman line is widely used as the criterion 
of fatigue failure when the component is subjected to 
mean stress as well as stress amplitude. It is because 
of the following reasons:
 
(i) The Goodman line is safe from design 
considerations because it is completely 
inside the failure points of test data.
 
(ii) The equation of a straight line is simple 
compared with the equation of a parabolic 
curve.
 (iii) It is not necessary to construct a scale 
diagram and a rough sketch is enough to 
construct fatigue diagram.
5.13 MODIFIED GOODMAN DIAGRAMS
The components, which are subjected to 
ﬂ uctuating stresses, are designed by constructing 
the modiﬁ ed Goodman diagram. For the purpose of 
design, the problems are classiﬁ ed into two groups: 
 
 (i) components subjected to ﬂ uctuating axial or 
bending stresses; and
 
 (ii) components subjected to ﬂ uctuating torsional 
shear stresses.
Separate diagrams are used in these two cases. 
The modiﬁ ed Goodman diagram for ﬂ uctuating 
axial or bending stresses is shown in Fig. 5.40. In 
this diagram, the Goodman line is ‘modiﬁ ed’ by 
combining fatigue failure with failure by yielding. 
In this diagram, the yield strength Syt is plotted on 
both the axes—abscissa and ordinate—and a yield 
line CD is constructed to join these two points to 
deﬁ ne failure by yielding. Obviously, the line CD is 
inclined at 45° to the abscissa. Similarly, a line AF 
is constructed to join Se on the ordinate with Sut on 
the abscissa, which is the Goodman line discussed 
in the previous article. The point of intersection 
of these two lines is B. The area OABC represents 
the region of safety for components subjected to 
ﬂ uctuating stresses. The region OABC is called 
modiﬁ ed Goodman diagram. All the points inside 
the modiﬁ ed Goodman diagram should cause neither 
fatigue failure nor yielding. The modiﬁ ed Goodman 
diagram combines fatigue criteria as represented by 
the Goodman line and yield criteria as represented 
by yield line. Note that AB is the portion of the 
Goodman line and BC is a portion of the yield line. 
 If the mean component of stress (sm) is very 
large and the alternating component (sa) very small, 
their combination will deﬁ ne a point in the region 
BCF that would be safely within the Goodman line 
but would yield on the ﬁ rst cycle. This will result 
in failure, irrespective of safety in fatigue failure. 
The portion BF of the Goodman line is a vulnerable 
portion and needs correction. This is the reason to 
modify the Goodman line.

Bending Stresses

The point of intersection of lines AB and OE is X. 
The point X indicates the dividing line between the 
safe region and the region of failure. The coordinates 
of the point X (Sm, Sa) represent the limiting values of 
stresses, which are used to calculate the dimensions 
of the component. The permissible stresses are as 
follows:

diagram, the torsional mean stress is plotted on the

abscissa while the torsional stress amplitude on the 
ordinate. The torsional yield strength Ssy is plotted on 
the abscissa and the yield line is constructed, which 
is inclined at 45° to the abscissa. It is interesting to 
note that up to a certain point, the torsional mean 
stress has no effect on the torsional endurance limit. 
Therefore, a line is drawn through Sse on the ordinate 
and parallel to the abscissa. The point of intersection 
of this line and the yield line is B. The area OABC 
represents the region of safety in this case. It is 
not necessary to construct a fatigue diagram for 
ﬂ uctuating torsional shear stresses because AB is 
parallel to the X-axis. Instead, a fatigue failure is 
indicated if,
 
ta = Sse 
 (5.42)
and a static failure is indicated if,
 
tmax = ta + tm = Ssy

from –100 N-m to + 400 N-m. The factor of safety 
is 2 and the expected reliability is 90%. Neglecting 
the effect of stress concentration, determine the 
diameter of the shaft.
Assume the distortion energy theory of failure.

Example 5.14 A spherical pressure vessel, with a 
500 mm inner diameter, is welded from steel plates. 
The welded joints are sufﬁ ciently strong and do not 
weaken the vessel. The plates are made from cold 
drawn steel 20C8 (Sut = 440 N/mm2 and Syt = 242 
N/mm2). The vessel is subjected to internal pressure, 
which varies from zero to 6 N/mm2. The expected 
reliability is 50% and the factor of safety is 3.5. 
The size factor is 0.85. The vessel is expected to 
withstand inﬁ nite number of stress cycles. Calculate 
the thickness of the plates.
Solution
Given For vessel Di = 500 mm
pi = zero to 6 N/mm2 Sut = 440 N/mm2
Syt = 242 N/mm2 R = 50% (fs) = 3.5 Kb = 0.85

 From Fig. 5.24 (cold drawn steel and

For 50% reliability, Kc = 1.0

Finite-Life Problems (Fluctuating Load)
Example 5.15 A cantilever spring made of 10 mm 
diameter wire is shown in Fig. 5.46. The wire is made 
of stainless steel 4Cr18Ni10  (Sut = 860 N/mm2 and 
Syt = 690 N/mm2). The force P acting at the free end 
varies from 75 N to 150 N. The surface ﬁ nish of the 
wire is equivalent to the machined surface. There is 
no stress concentration and the expected reliability 
is 50%. Calculate the number of stress cycles likely 
to cause fatigue failure.
Fig. 5.46
Solution
Given For cantilever spring, d = 10 mm
l = 500 mm P = 75 to 150 N Sut = 860 N/mm2  
Syt = 690 N/mm2 R = 50%
Step I Endurance limit stress for cantilever beam

 From Fig. 5.24 (machined surface and Sut = 860

For 10 mm diameter wire,  Kb = 0.85
For 50% reliability,

Example 5.16  A polished steel bar is subjected 
to axial tensile force that varies from zero to Pmax. 
It has a groove 2 mm deep and having a radius of 
3 mm. The theoretical stress concentration factor 
and notch sensitivity factor at the groove are 1.8 
and 0.95 respectively. The outer diameter of the bar 
is 30 mm. The ultimate tensile strength of the bar is 
1250 MPa. The endurance limit in reversed bending 
is 600 MPa. Find the maximum force that the bar 
can carry for 105 cycles with 90% reliability.
Solution
Given P = 0 to Pmax  Sut = 1250 MPa
S¢e = 600 MPa Kt = 1.8 q = 0.95 R = 90% 
N = 105 cycles
Step I Endurance limit stress for bar 
S¢e = 600 MPa = 600 N/mm2
From Fig. 5.24 (polished surface),  Ka = 1
For 30 mm diameter wire,  Kb = 0.85
For 90% reliability,  Kc = 0.897
From Eq. (5.12),
 Kf = 1 + q (Kt – 1) = 1 + 0.95 (1.8 – 1) = 1.76

5.14 GERBER EQUATION
The Soderberg line and Goodman line illustrated in 
Fig. 5.39 are straight lines. The theories using such 
straight lines for predicting fatigue failure are called 
‘linear’ theories. There are some theories that use 
parabolic or elliptical curves instead of straight lines. 
These theories are called ‘non-linear’ theories. One 
Design against Fluctuating Load 175
of the most popular non-linear theories is the Gerber 
theory that is based on parabolic curve. The Gerber 
curve is shown in Fig. 5.52. The equation for the 
Gerber curve is as follows:

Theories based on the Soderberg line or the 
Goodman line, as failure criteria are conservative 
theories. This results in increased dimensions of the 
component. The Gerber curve takes the mean path 
through failure points. It is therefore more accurate 
in predicting fatigue failure.
Example 5.17  A machine component is subjected 
to ﬂ uctuating stress that varies from 40 to 100
N/mm2. The corrected endurance limit stress for 
the machine component is 270 N/mm2. The ultimate 
tensile strength and yield strength of the material 
are 600 and 450 N/mm2
 respectively. Find the factor 
of safety using
 
(i) Gerber theory
 
(ii) Soderberg line
 (iii) Goodman line
Also, ﬁ nd the factor of safety against static 
failure.

5.15  FATIGUE DESIGN UNDER 
COMBINED STRESSES
The problems discussed so far are based on the 
construction of the modiﬁ ed Goodman diagram for 
the component, which is subjected to either axial 
load or bending moment or torsional moment. Each 
type of loading is considered separately. In practice, 
the problems are more complicated because the 
component may be subjected to two-dimensional 
stresses, or to combined bending and torsional 
moments. In case of two-dimensional stresses, each 
of the two stresses may have two components—
mean and alternating. Similarly, the bending 
moment as well as torsional moment may have two 
components—mean and alternating. Such problems 
involving combination of stresses are solved by 
the distortion energy theory of failure. The most 
general equation of the distortion energy theory is 
as follows:

178 Design of Machine Elements
Example 5.19 A machine component is subjected 
to two-dimensional stresses. The tensile stress in 
the X direction varies from 40 to 100 N/mm2 while 
the tensile stress in the Y direction varies from 10 
to 80 N/mm2. The frequency of variation of these 
stresses is equal. The corrected endurance limit of 
the component is 270 N/mm2. The ultimate tensile 
strength of the material of the component is 660 
N/mm2. Determine the factor of safety used by the 
designer.
Solution
Given (sx)max. = 100 N/mm2
(sx)min. = 40 N/mm2 (sy)max. = 80 N/mm2 (sy)min. 
= 10 N/mm2 Sut = 600 N/mm2 Se = 270 N/mm2

Example 5.20 A transmission shaft carries 
a pulley midway between the two bearings. 
The bending moment at the pulley varies from
200 N-m to 600 N-m, as the torsional moment 
in the shaft varies from 70 N-m to 200 N-m. The 
frequencies of variation of bending and torsional 
moments are equal to the shaft speed. The shaft is 
made of steel FeE 400 (Sut = 540 N/mm2 and Syt  = 
400 N/mm2). The corrected endurance limit of the 
shaft is 200 N/mm2. Determine the diameter of the 
shaft using a factor of safety of 2.
Solution
Given (Mt)max. = 200 N-m
(Mt)min. = 70 N-m (Mb)max. = 600 N-m
(Mb)min. = 200 N-m Sut = 540 N/mm2
Syt = 400 N/mm2 Se = 200 N/mm2 (fs) = 2

5.16 IMPACT STRESSES
Impact is deﬁ ned as a collision of one component 
in motion with a second component, which may be 
either in motion or at rest. Impact load is the load 
which is rapidly applied to the machine component. 
Driving a nail with a hammer or breaking a coconut 
are examples of impact force. The stress induced in 
the machine component due to impact load is called 
impact stress. Impact forces are observed in machine 
components like hoisting ropes, hammers, springs, 
punches and shears, clutches and brakes.
Fig. 5.57 Impact Load
We will consider an elastic system loaded 
by a falling weight W as shown in Fig. 5.57 and 
investigate the effect of impact. Suppose,
W = falling weight (N)
h = height through which the weight falls (mm)
d = displacement of the point of load application  
 
(mm)
l = length of the bar (mm)
A = cross-sectional area of the bar (mm2)
P = impact force which produces deﬂ ection d (N)
E = modulus of elasticity of bar material (N/mm2) 
si = impact stress in the bar (N/mm2)
The weight W falls through the height h and 
strikes the collar of the bar. In this process, the 
potential energy released by the falling weight is 
absorbed by the bar and stored in the form of strain 
energy.
Energy released by falling weight = potential 
energy = W(h + d)
Energy absorbed by the system = strain energy =

of safety is 2. The modulus of elasticity is 207 000

6.1 POWER SCREWS
A power screw is a mechanical device used for 
converting rotary motion into linear motion and 
transmitting power. A power screw is also called a 
translation screw. It uses helical translatory motion 
of the screw thread in transmitting power rather 
than clamping the machine components. The main 
applications of power screws are as follows:
 
(i) to raise the load, e.g., screw-jack;
 
(ii) to obtain accurate motion in machining 
operations, e.g., lead-screw of lathe;
 (iii) to clamp a work piece, e.g., a vice; and
 (iv) to load a specimen, e.g., universal testing 
machine.
There are three essential parts of the power 
screw, viz., screw, nut and a part to hold either the 
screw or the nut in its place. Depending upon the 
holding arrangement, power screws operate in two 
different ways. In some cases, the screw rotates in 
its bearing, while the nut has axial motion. The lead 
screw of the lathe is an example of this category. In 
other applications, the nut is kept stationary and the 
screw moves in an axial direction. A screw jack and 
machine vice are the examples of this category. A 
power screw offers the following advantages:
 
(i) A power screw has large load carrying 
capacity.
 
(ii) The overall dimensions of the power screw 
are small, resulting in compact construction.
 (iii) A power screw is simple to design.
 (iv) The manufacturing of a power screw is easy 
without requiring specilised machinery. 
Square threads are turned on the lathe. 
Trapezoidal threads are manufactured on a 
thread milling machine.
 
(v) A power screw provides large mechanical 
advantage. A load of 15 kN can be raised 
by applying an effort as small as 400 N. 
Therefore, most of the power screws used 
in various applications like screw-jacks, 
clamps, valves and vices are manually 
operated.
 (vi) A power screw provides precisely controlled 
and highly accurate linear motion required 
in machine tool applications.
 (vii) A power screw gives smooth and noiseless 
service without any maintenance.
 (viii) There are few parts in a power screw. This 
reduces cost and increases reliability.
 (ix) A power screw can be designed with self-
locking property. In screw-jack application, 
self-locking characteristic is required to 
prevent the load from descending on its own.
The disadvantages of a power screw are as 
follows:
 
(i) A power screw has very poor efﬁ ciency, 
as low as 40%. Therefore, it is not used 
in 
continuous 
power 
transmission 
in 
machine tools, with the exception of the 
Power Screws
Chapter 6
Power Screws 185
lead screw. Power screws are mainly used 
for intermittent motion that is occasionally 
required for lifting the load or actuating the 
mechanism.
 
(ii) High friction in threads causes rapid wear 
of the screw or the nut. In case of square 
threads, the nut is usually made of soft 
material and replaced when worn out. In 
trapezoidal threads, a split-type of nut is 
used to compensate for the wear. Therefore, 
wear is a serious problem in power screws. 
There are two types of applications of power 
screws—applications where high efﬁ ciency is 
desired and applications where low efﬁ ciency is 
desired. The applications where high efﬁ ciency is 
expected are power transmission applications such 
as lead screw and presses. The applications where 
low efﬁ ciency is desired for the purpose of self-
locking, are screw jacks, clamps and vices.
The efﬁ ciency of a power screw is increased if 
sliding friction is replaced by rolling friction. This 
principle is used in recirculating ball screw.
6.2 FORMS OF THREADS
The threads used for fastening purposes, such as 
V threads are not suitable for power screws. The 
purpose of fastening threads is to provide high 
frictional force, which lessens the possibility of 
loosening the parts assembled by threaded joint. On 
the other hand, the purpose of power transmission 
threads is to reduce friction between the screw and 
nut. Therefore, V threads are not suitable for power 
screws. Screws with smaller angle of thread, such 
as trapezoidal threads, are preferred for power 
transmission. 
There are two popular types of threads used 
for power screws, viz., square and ISO metric 
trapezoidal, as shown in Fig. 6.1. The advantages 
of square threads over trapezoidal threads are as 
follows:
 
(i) The efﬁ ciency of  square threads is more 
than that of  trapezoidal threads.
 
(ii) There is no radial pressure or side thrust 
on the nut. This radial pressure is called 
‘bursting’ pressure on the nut. Since 
there is no side thrust, the motion of the 
nut is uniform. The life of the nut is also 
increased.
Fig. 6.1 Forms of Thread
The disadvantages of square threads are as follows:
 
(i) Square threads are difﬁ cult to manufacture. 
They are usually turned on a lathe with a 
single-point cutting tool. Machining with 
a single-point cutting tool is an expensive 
operation compared with machining with a 
multi-point cutting tool.
 
(ii) The strength of a screw depends upon 
the thread thickness at the core diameter. 
As shown in Fig. 6.1, square threads have 
less thickness at the core diameter than 
trapezoidal threads. This reduces the load 
carrying capacity of the screw.
 (iii) The wear of the thread surface becomes 
a serious problem in the service life of 
the power screw. It is not possible to 
compensate for wear in square threads. 
Therefore, when worn out, the nut or the 
screw requires replacement.
The advantages of trapezoidal threads over 
square threads are as follows:
 
(i) Trapezoidal threads are manufactured on a 
thread milling machine. It employs a multi-
point cutting tool. Machining with a multi-
point cutting tool is an economic operation 
compared with machining with a single-
point cutting tool. Therefore, trapezoidal 
threads are economical to manufacture.
 
(ii) A trapezoidal thread has more thickness 
at the core diameter than a square thread. 
Therefore, a screw with trapezoidal threads 
is stronger than an equivalent screw with 
square threads. Such a screw has a large 
load carrying capacity.
186 Design of Machine Elements
 (iii) The axial wear on the surface of trapezoidal 
threads can be compensated by means of a 
split-type of nut. The nut is cut into two parts 
along the diameter. When the threads get worn 
out, the two halves of the nut are tightened 
together. The split-type nut can be used only 
for trapezoidal threads. It is used in lead-screw 
of a lathe to compensate wear at periodic 
intervals by tightening the two halves. 
The disadvantages of trapezoidal threads are as 
follows:
 
(i) The efﬁ ciency of trapezoidal threads is less 
than that of square threads.
 
(ii) Trapezoidal threads result in side thrust 
or radial pressure on the nut. The radial 
pressure or bursting pressure on the nut 
affects its performance.
There is a special type of trapezoidal thread 
called  acme thread. It is shown in Fig. 6.2. 
Trapezoidal and acme threads are identical in all 
respects except the thread angle. In an acme thread, 
the thread angle is 29° instead of 30°. The relative 
advantages and disadvantages of acme threads are 
same as those of trapezoidal threads.
Fig. 6.2 Acme Threads
There is another type of thread called buttress 
thread. It is shown in Fig. 6.3. It combines the 
advantages of square and trapezoidal threads. 
Buttress threads are used where a heavy axial force 
acts along the screw axis in one direction only. The 
advantages of buttress threads are as follows:
 
(i) It has higher efﬁ ciency compared with 
trapezoidal threads.
 
(ii) It can be economically manufactured on a 
thread milling machine.
 (iii) The axial wear at the thread surface can be 
compensated by means of a split-type nut.
 (iv) A screw with buttress threads is stronger 
than an equivalent screw with either square 
threads or trapezoidal threads. This is 
because of greater thickness at the base of 
the thread. 
Fig. 6.3 Buttress Threads
The  buttress threads have one disadvantage. 
It can transmit power and motion only in one 
direction. On the other hand, square and trapezoidal 
threads can transmit force and motion in both 
directions.
Square threads are used for screw jacks, presses 
and clamping devices. Trapezoidal and acme 
threads are used for lead-screw and other power 
transmission devices in machine tools. Buttress 
threads are used in vices, where force is applied 
only in one direction. Buttress threads are ideally 
suited for connecting tubular components that 
must carry large forces such as connecting the 
barrel to the housing in anti-aircraft guns. The 
standard proportions of square and ISO metric 
trapezoidal threads are given in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 
respectively.1, 2

There is a particular method of designation for 
square and trapezoidal threads. A power screw with 
single-start square threads is designated by the 
letters ‘Sq’ followed by the nominal diameter and 
the pitch expressed in millimetres and separated by 
the sign ‘¥’. For example, 
 
Sq 30 ¥ 6 
It indicates single-start square threads with 
30 mm nominal diameter and 6 mm pitch.
Similarly, single-start ISO metric trapezoidal 
threads are designated by the letters ‘Tr’ followed 
by the nominal diameter and the pitch expressed 
in millimetres and separated by the sign ‘¥’. For 
example, 
 
Tr 40 ¥ 7
It indicates single-start trapezoidal threads with 
40 mm nominal diameter and 7 mm pitch.
Multiple-start trapezoidal threads are designated 
by the letters ‘Tr’ followed by the nominal 
diameter and the lead, separated by the sign ‘¥’ 
and in brackets the letter ‘P’ followed by the pitch 
expressed in millimetres. For example,
 
Tr 40 ¥ 14 (P 7)
In the above designation,
 
lead = 14 mm  pitch = 7 mm
\ No. of starts = 14/7 = 2
Therefore, the above designation indicates a 
two-start trapezoidal thread with 40 mm nominal 
diameter and a 7 mm pitch. In case of left-hand 
threads, the letter LH is added to the thread 
designation. For example,
 
Tr 40 ¥ 14 (P 7) LH
6.3 MULTIPLE THREADED SCREWS
Multiple threaded power screws are used in certain 
applications where higher travelling speed is 
required. They are also called multiple start screws 
such as double-start or triple-start screws. These 
screws have two or more threads cut side by side, 
around the rod. Such a screw can be imagined by 
winding two or more coloured strings side by side 
around the pencil. A multiple threaded screw has 
the following advantages:
 
(i) It provides large axial motion per revolution 
of the screw. This increases the travelling 
speed of the sliding member. For a double-
start screw, the travelling speed is twice that 
of the single-start screw. 
 
(ii) The efﬁ ciency of a multi-threaded screw is 
more than a single-threaded screw due to 
increase in helix angle.
The disadvantages of a multiple threaded screw 
are as follows:
 
(i) The mechanical advantage obtained with 
multiple threaded screws is lower than that 
of a single-threaded screw. Therefore, the 
effort required to raise a particular load or 
apply a particular force is more.
 
(ii) It is likely that the self-locking property 
may be lost in a multi-threaded screw. The 
resulting condition is dangerous in certain 
applications like screw jacks, where the 
load may descend on its own.
Multiple threaded screws are used in high speed 
actuators and sluice valves.
6.4 TERMINOLOGY OF POWER SCREW 
The main dimensions of a double-threaded screw 
are shown in Fig. 6.4. The terminology of the screw 
thread is as follows:
(i) Pitch The pitch is deﬁ ned as the distance 
measured parallel to the axis of the screw from a 
point on one thread to the corresponding point on 
the adjacent thread. It is denoted by the letter p.
(ii) Lead The lead is deﬁ ned as the distance 
measured parallel to the axis of the screw which the 
188 Design of Machine Elements
nut will advance in one revolution of the screw. It is 
denoted by the letter l. For a single-threaded screw, 
the lead is same as the pitch. For a double-threaded 
screw, the lead is twice of the pitch, and so on.
Fig. 6.4 Terminology of Power Screw
(iii) Nominal Diameter Nominal diameter is the 
largest diameter of the screw. It is also called major 
diameter. It is denoted by the letter d.
(iv) Core Diameter The core diameter is the smallest 
diameter of the screw thread. It is also called minor 
diameter. It is denoted by the letters dc.
(v) Helix Angle The helix angle is deﬁ ned as the 
angle made by the helix of the thread with a plane 
perpendicular to the axis of the screw. The helix 
angle is related to the lead and the mean diameter 
of the screw. It is also called lead angle. The helix 
angle is denoted by a.

Let us imagine that one thread of the screw is 
unwound and developed for one complete turn. 
This development of the thread is illustrated in 
Fig. 6.5. The thread will become the hypotenuse 
of a right-angle triangle, whose base is (pdm) and 
whose height is the lead (l). This can be imagined 
by cutting the paper in the form of the right-angle 
triangle, with base equal to (πdm) and height equal 
to (l). Wrap this paper around a rod with diameter 
dm. The hypotenuse of the triangle will become the 
thread around the rod. Considering this right-angle 
triangle, the relationship between the helix angle, 
mean diameter and lead can be expressed in the 
following form:

Fig. 6.5 Development of Thread
 Figure 6.5 is used as basis for determining the 
torque required to raise or lower the load. The 
following conclusions can be drawn on the basis of 
development of thread,
 
(i) The screw can be considered as an inclined 
plane with α as the inclination.
 
(ii) The load W always acts in a vertically 
downward direction. When the load W is 
raised, it moves up the inclined plane. When 
the load W is lowered, it moves down the 
inclined plane.
 (iii) The load W is raised or lowered by means 
of an imaginary force P acting at the mean 
radius of the screw. The force P multiplied 
by the mean radius (dm/2) gives the 
torque required to raise or lower the load. 
Remember P is perpendicular to the load W.
We will consider two separate cases to ﬁ nd out 
the torque required to raise or lower the load in the 
following articles.

6.5 TORQUE REQUIREMENT—
LIFTING LOAD
The screw is considered as an inclined plane with 
inclination a as shown in Fig. 6.6. When the load is 
being raised, the following forces act at a point on 
this inclined plane:
(i) Load W It always acts in a vertically downward 
direction.
(ii) Normal Reaction N It acts perpendicular (normal) 
to the inclined plane.
(iii) Frictional Force µN Frictional force acts opposite 
to the motion. Since the load is moving up the inclined 
plane, frictional force acts along the inclined plane in the 
downward direction.
(iv) Effort P It is explained in the previous article that 
the effort P acts perpendicular to the load W. It may act 
towards the right or towards the left. It should act towards 
the right to overcome the friction and raise the load.

When the load is being lowered, the forces acting 
at a point on the inclined plane are shown in

(i) Load W It acts in a vertically downward 
direction.

6.7  SELF-LOCKING SCREW
The torque required to lower the load can be 
obtained by Eq. (6.8). Rewriting the equation,
 
Mt = Wdm
2
tan (f – a)
it can be seen that when;  f < a the torque required 
to lower the load is negative. It indicates a 
condition that no force is required to lower the 
load. The load itself will begin to turn the screw 
and descend down, unless a restraining torque is 
applied. This condition is called overhauling of the 
screw. This condition is also called back driving 
of screw. This property is not useful in screw-jack 
applications. However, it is useful in some other 
applications like a Yankee screwdriver. In this type 
of screwdriver, there is a high-lead thread on the 
barrel and the handle is a nut. As the worker pushes 
the handle axially down, the barrel turns and drives 
the wood screw into place.
When f ≥ a a positive torque is required to 
lower the load. Under this condition, the load will 
not turn the screw and will not descend on its own 
unless an effort P is applied. In this case, the screw 
is said to be ‘self-locking’. A self-locking screw 
will hold the load in place without a brake. This is a 
very useful property in screw-jack application. For 
example, the driver can jack up the car and leave 
the jack handle and carry out the work. The car will 
not descend on its own during the work and the 
driver can do the work without any tension.
Neglecting collar friction, the rule for a self-
locking screw is as follows,
 “A screw will be self-locking if the coefﬁ cient of 
friction is equal to or greater than the tangent of 
the helix angle”.
For a self-locking screw,  
 
f > a 
 
 tan f > tan a
 
 m
p
>
l
dm
 
(6.9)
The following conclusions are drawn by 
examination of Eq. (6.9).
 
(i) Self-locking of screw is not possible when 
the coefﬁ cient of friction (m) is low. The 
coefﬁ cient of friction between the surfaces 
of the screw and the nut is reduced by 
lubrication. Excessive lubrication may 
cause the load to descend on its own.
 
(ii) Self-locking property of the screw is lost 
when the lead is large. The lead increases 
with a number of starts. For a double-start 
thread, the lead is twice of the pitch and for 
a triple-threaded screw, it is three times of 
the pitch. Therefore, single-threaded screw 
is better than multiple-threaded screws from 
self-locking considerations.
Self-locking condition is essential in applications 
like screw jacks.
6.8 EFFICIENCY OF SQUARE THREADED 
SCREW 
Let us refer to the force diagram for lifting the load, 
illustrated in Fig. 6.6. Suppose the load W moves 
from the lower end to the upper end of the inclined 
plane. The output consists of raising the load. 
Therefore,
Work output = force ¥ distance travelled in the 
direction of force = (Wl)
The input consists of rotating the screw by 
means of an effort P.
Work input = force ¥ distance traveled in the 
direction of force = P(p dm)

Power Screws 191
The efﬁ ciency of a square threaded power screw 
depends upon (a) and (f). Also, (a) depends upon 
the lead (l) and mean diameter of screw (dm), since 
(tan a = l/pdm).
Conclusions The efﬁ ciency of a square threaded 
power screw depends upon the following three 
factors:
 
(i) Mean diameter of screw
 
(ii) Lead of the screw
 (iii) Coefﬁ cient of friction
The above expression of efﬁ ciency has certain 
limitations. It considers frictional loss only at the 
contacting surfaces between the screw and the nut. 
It does not take into consideration other frictional 
losses, such as collar-friction loss. Therefore, the 
equation does not give the overall efﬁ ciency of the 
screw mechanism.
 From Eq. (6.10), it is evident that the efﬁ ciency 
of the square threaded screw depends upon the 
helix angle a and the friction angle f. Figure 
6.8 shows variation of the efﬁ ciency of a square 
Fig. 6.8 Efﬁ ciency of Square Threaded Screw
threaded screw against the helix angle for various 
values of coefﬁ cient of friction. The graph is 
applicable when the load is lifted. The following 
conclusions can be derived from the observation of 
these graphs:
 
(i) The efﬁ ciency of a square threaded screw 
increases rapidly up to helix angle of 20°.
 
(ii) The efﬁ ciency is maximum, when the helix 
angle is between 40 to 45°.
 (iii) The efﬁ ciency decreases after the maximum 
value is reached.
 (iv) The efﬁ ciency decreases rapidly when the 
helix angle exceeds 60°.
 
(v) The efﬁ ciency decreases as the coefﬁ cient 
of friction increases.
There are two ways to increase the efﬁ ciency of 
a square threaded screw. They are as follows:
 
(i) Reduce the coefﬁ cient of friction between 
the screw and the nut by proper lubrication; 
and
 
(ii) Increase the helix angle up to 40° to 45° by 
using multiple-start threads.
However, a screw with such a helix angle 
has other disadvantages like loss of self-locking 
property.

The coefﬁ cient of friction is constant and 
the only variable is (a). For efﬁ ciency (h) to

6.10 TRAPEZOIDAL AND ACME 
THREADS
The force acting on the surface of the trapezoidal 
thread is shown in Fig. 6.9. The thread angle is 
(2θ).
Fig. 6.9 Force Diagram for Trapezoidal Thread
For ISO Metric trapezoidal thread,  2θ = 30°
For acme thread, 
 2θ = 29°
There is a basic difference between the force 
acting on the thread of the square and trapezoidal 
threads. In case of square threads, W is the axial 
load raised by the screw. It is also the normal force 
acting on the thread surface. In case of trapezoidal 
or acme threads, these two forces are different. As 
shown in Fig. 6.9, the axial force on the screw is 
W, while the normal force on the thread surface is 
(W/cos q) or (W sec q). The frictional force depends 
upon the normal force. Therefore, the effect of 
the thread angle is to increase the frictional force 
by a term (sec θ). To account for this effect, the 
coefﬁ cient of friction is taken as (m sec θ) instead 
of (m) in case of trapezoidal threads. The equations 
Power Screws 193
derived for a square threaded screw are used for 
trapezoidal or acme threads by making this change.

6.11 COLLAR FRICTION TORQUE
In many applications of the power screw, there 
is collar friction in addition to the friction at the 
thread surface. The principle of collar friction can 
be explained with the help of Fig. 6.10(a). The 
cup remains stationary under the action of the load 
W, while the collar that is integral with the screw 
rotates when the load is being raised or lowered. 
Therefore, there is relative motion between the 
cup and the collar at the annular interface from 
diameter Di to Do. This relative motion results in 
friction called collar friction. The torque required 
to overcome this friction or collar friction torque 
(Mt)c can be determined by using uniform pressure 
theory or uniform wear theory.

where

Do = outer diameter of the collar (mm)
 
 Di = inner diameter of the collar (mm)
 
 (Mt)c =  collar friction torque (N-mm)
Uniform pressure theory is applicable only when 
the collar surface is new. Uniform wear theory is 
applicable to the collar surface after the initial wear. 
Therefore, it is logical to use uniform wear theory 
for collar friction.
 There is a simple method to derive Eq. (6.18) 
applicable to uniform wear condition. Since 
194 Design of Machine Elements
the normal force on the collar surface is W, the 
frictional force over the collar surface is µcW. It is 
assumed that frictional force is concentrated at the 
mean collar diameter Dm as shown in Fig. 6.10(b). 
This force acts opposite to the rotation of the collar 
surface. The collar friction torque is given by,
 
 (Mt)c = µcW

In certain applications, the collar between the cup 
and the screw is replaced by thrust ball bearing to 
reduce friction. The advantage of using thrust ball 
bearing at the collar is that the sliding friction is 
replaced by rolling friction. The collar friction 
torque becomes almost negligible in these cases. 
Eqs (6.17) and (6.18) should not be used where 
rolling contact bearings are employed to take the 
thrust reaction.
6.12 OVERALL EFFICIENCY
The total external torque required to raise the 
load consists of two factors—the torque required 
to overcome friction at the thread surface and the 
collar friction torque. Therefore,
 
 (Mt)t = Mt + (Mt)c 
(6.19) 
where 
 (Mt)t = external torque required to raise the load  
 
(N-mm);
 Mt = torque required to overcome friction at  
 
 
the thread surface (N-mm); and 
 (Mt)c = collar friction torque (N-mm)
Let us again refer to the force diagram for lifting 
the load shown in Fig. 6.6. Suppose the load W 
moves from the lower end to the upper end of the 
inclined plane. The output consists of raising the 
load.
Work output = force ¥ distance traveled in the 
direction of force = (W l)
The input consists of torque applied to the screw 
(Mt)t.
Work input = torque ¥ angle turned through

6.13 COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION
It has been found that the coefﬁ cient of friction 
(m) at the thread surface depends upon the 
workmanship in cutting the threads and on the type 
of the lubricant. It is practically independent of the 
load, rubbing velocity or materials. An average 
value of 0.15 can be taken for the coefﬁ cient of 
friction at the thread surface, when the screw is 
lubricated with mineral oil. The values of the 
coefﬁ cient of friction (mc) for the thrust collar 
with sliding contact are given in Table 6.3. When 
thrust ball bearing is used at the collar surface, 
its coefﬁ cient of friction is about 1/10th of plain 
sliding surface. It varies from 0.01 to 0.02.

6.14 DESIGN OF SCREW AND NUT
There are three basic components of a power screw, 
viz., screw, nut and frame. The desirable properties 
of screw material are as follows:
 
(i) It should have sufﬁ cient strength to 
withstand stresses due to external load and 
applied torque.
Power Screws 195
 
(ii) It should possess high wear resistance.
 (iii) It should have good machinability.
Screws are made of plain carbon steel such as 
30C8, 40C8 and 45C8 or alloy steels like 40Cr1. 
The screws are case hardened, e.g., the lead screw 
of a lathe is case hardened by the nitriding process.
There is a relative motion between the screw 
and the nut and wear is inevitable. The material for 
the nut should be soft and conformable to that of 
the screw. The wear is always restricted to a softer 
surface. Therefore, if at all a component is to be 
replaced, it should be the nut, which is less costly 
compared to the screw. Bronze is the ideal material 
for nut. Mainly tin bronze and phosphor bronze are 
used for nut.
The frame of a power screw is usually made of 
grey cast iron of grade FG 200. Cast iron is cheap, 
can be given any complex shape and possesses high 
compressive strength.

The threads of the screw, which are engaged 
with the nut, are subjected to transverse shear 
stress. The screw will tend to shear off the threads 
at the core diameter under the action of the load 
W. The shear area of one thread is (pdct). The 
transverse shear stress in the screw is given by
 
 ts = 
W

 (6.21)
where
  ts = transverse shear stress at the root of the  
 
screw (N/mm2)
 t = thread thickness at the core diameter (mm)
 z = number of threads in engagement with the nut 
The transverse shear stresses in the nut are 
determined in a similar way. Under the action of 
the load W, the thread of the nut will tend to shear 
off at the nominal diameter. The shear area of one 
thread is (pdt). Therefore,
 
 tn = W

design.

Example 6.1 
The nominal diameter of a triple-
threaded square screw is 50 mm, while the pitch 
is 8 mm. It is used with a collar having an outer 
diameter of 100 mm and inner diameter as 65 mm. 
The coefﬁ cient of friction at the thread surface 
as well as at the collar surface can be taken as 
0.15. The screw is used to raise a load of 15 kN. 
Using the uniform wear theory for collar friction, 
calculate:
 
(i) torque required to raise the load;
 
(ii) torque required to lower the load; and
 (iii) the force required to raise the load, if 
applied at a radius of 500 mm.
Solution
Given W = 15 kN

calculate

Fig. 6.13. The screw is rotated in its place by 
means of the handle. The nut is ﬁ xed to the gate. 
When the screw rotates, the nut along with the 
gate moves downward or upward depending upon

Gate Valve
the direction of rotation of the screw. The screw 
has single-start square threads of 40 mm outer 
diameter and 7 mm pitch. The weight of the gate 
is 5 kN. The water pressure in the pipeline induces 
frictional resistance between the gate and its seat. 
The resultant frictional resistance in the axial 
direction is 2 kN. The inner and outer diameters of 
thrust washer are 40 and 80 mm respectively. The 
values of coefﬁ cient of friction at the threads and 
at the washer are 0.15 and 0.12 respectively. The 
handle is rotated by the two arms, each exerting 
equal force at a radius of 500 mm from the axis of 
the screw. Calculate
 
(i) the maximum force exerted by each arm 
when the gate is being raised;
 
(ii) the maximum force exerted by each arm 
when the gate is being lowered;
 (iii) the efﬁ ciency of the gate mechanism; and

bearing pressure is 5 N/mm2.
Solution
Given For screw,  d = 40 mm  l = p = 7 mm
 
m = 0.15
For collar,  Do = 80 mm  Di = 40 mm
 
m = 0.12
For handle, radius = 500 mm

For gate,  weight = 5 kN
 frictional resistant = 2 kN

Frictional resistance acts opposite to the motion. 
When the gate is being raised the frictional force 
acts in downward direction. Therefore, axial force 
on the screw consists of addition of the weight of 
the gate plus the frictional resistance. Or,

In a machine tool application, 
the tool holder is pulled by means of an operating 
nut mounted on a screw. The tool holder travels 
at a speed of 5 m/min. The screw has single-start 
square threads of 48 mm nominal diameter and 8 
mm pitch. The operating nut exerts a force of 500 
N to drive the tool holder. The mean radius of the 
friction collar is 40 mm. The coefﬁ cient of friction 
at thread and collar surfaces is 0.15. Calculate

mum force exerted by the clamp is 5 kN. It is 
assumed that the operator will exert a force 
of 250 N at the ball handle of the hand wheel. 
The screw is made of plain carbon steel 45C8 
(Syt = 330 N/mm2), while the nut is made of grey 
cast iron FG 200. The dimensions of the collar 
are given in Fig. 6.15(b). The factor of safety is 2. 
Determine the dimensions of the screw and the nut 
and calculate the radius Rm of the ball handle.

There are additional stresses due to the collar

calculate the additional stresses in the lower and 
upper parts of the screw. To account for these 
additional stresses, the diameter should be increased. 
As a ﬁ rst trial, a screw with a 22 mm nominal

Example 6.10 
It is required to design a ﬂ y-
press, as shown in Fig. 6.17, which is capable of 
punching 50 mm diameter circles from a 1.5 mm 
Fig. 6.17 Fly-press
thick mild steel sheet. The ultimate shear strength of 
the sheet metal is 375 N/mm2 and it can be assumed 
that shearing will be complete when the punch 
penetrates through half the thickness of the sheet. 
The screw, with square threads, is made of steel 30C8 
(Syt = 400 N/mm2), while the nut is made of bronze. 
The factor of safety is 3. The operator is expected 
to sit in front of the ﬂ y-press, insert the sheet by his 
left hand and operate the handle by the right hand. 
The total working stroke consists of a one-quarter 
revolution, 45° in front of the press and 45° behind 
the press. During the return stroke, the punch is 
raised by 5 mm to provide clearance to insert the 
sheet. The forward or working stroke is completed 
in 1 second. The balls are made of cast iron, with a 
mass density of 7280 kg/m3 and the radius Rm is 500 
mm. Neglecting collar friction, calculate 
 
(i) the dimensions of the screw; 
Power Screws 205
 
(ii) the length of the nut; and 
 (iii) the size of the balls.
Solution
Given For screw, Syt = 400 N/mm2 (fs) = 3
For punched holes, d = 50 mm t = 1.5 mm 
 
Sus = 375 N/mm2

In addition to compressive stress, the screw is 
subjected to torsional shear stress. Therefore, the 
core diameter is to be increased. As a ﬁ rst trial value, 
a nominal diameter of 50 mm with 8 mm pitch is 
recommended for the screw. Since the punch is to 
be raised by 5 mm during the return stroke of one-
quarter revolution, the minimum lead should be 20 
mm. The screw is therefore triple-threaded.

6.15  DESIGN OF SCREW JACK
A  screw jack is a portable device consisting of 
a screw mechanism used to raise or lower the 
load. There are two types of jacks—hydraulic and 
mechanical. A hydraulic jack consists of a cylinder 
and piston mechanism. The movement of the piston 
rod is used to raise or lower the load. Mechanical 
jacks can be either hand operated or power driven. 
Although a jack is simple and widely used device, 
the use of any lifting device is subject to certain 
hazards. In screw-jack applications, the hazards 
are dropping, tipping or slipping of machines or 
their parts during the operation. These hazards may 
result in serious accidents. The main reasons of 
such accidents are as follows:
 
(i) The load is improperly secured on the jack.
 
(ii) The screw jack is overloaded. 
 (iii) The centre of gravity of the load is off-
centre with respect to the axis of the jack.
 (iv) The screw jack is not placed on hard and 
level surface. 
 
(v) The screw jack is used for a purpose for 
which it is not designed. 
Proper size, strength and stability are the 
essential requirements for the design of the screw 
jack from safety considerations.
The construction of screw jack is shown in Fig. 
6.18. It consists of a screw and a nut. The nut is 
ﬁ xed in a cast iron frame and remains stationary.
Fig. 6.18 Screw Jack
Power Screws 207
The rotation of the nut inside the frame is prevented 
by pressing a setscrew against it. The screw is rotated 
in the nut by means of a handle, which passes through 
a hole in the head of the screw. The head carries a cup, 
which supports the load and remains stationary while 
the screw is being rotated. There is a collar friction at 
the annular contacting surface between the cup and 
the head of the screw. A washer is ﬁ xed to the other 
end of the screw inside the frame, which prevents the 
screw to be completely turned out of the nut.
Step I Problem Speciﬁ cation
It is required to design a screw jack for supporting 
the machine parts during their repair and 
maintenance on the shop ﬂ oor. It should be a 
general-purpose jack with a load carrying capacity 
of 100 kN and a maximum lifting height of 0.5 m. 
The jack is to be manually operated. 
Step II Selection of Materials
 
(i) The frame of the screw jack has complex 
shape. It is subjected to compressive stress. 
Grey cast iron of grade FG 200 (Sut = 200 
N/mm2) is selected as the material for the 
frame. Cast iron is cheap and it can be 
given any complex shape without involving 
costly machining operations. Cast iron has 
higher compressive strength compared 
with steel. Therefore, it is technically and 
economically advantageous to use cast iron 
for the frame.
 
(ii) The screw is subjected to torsional moment, 
compressive force and bending moment. 
From strength consideration, plain carbon 
steel of grade 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2 and 
E = 207 000 N/mm2) is selected as material 
for the screw.
 (iii) There is relative motion between the screw 
and the nut, which results in friction. The 
friction causes wear at the contacting 
surfaces. When the same material is used 
for these two components, the surfaces of 
both components get worn out, requiring 
replacement. This is undesirable. The 
size and shape of the screw make it costly 
compared with the nut. Therefore, if at 
all a component is to be replaced due to 
wear, it should be the nut, which is less 
costly compared with the screw. The wear 
is always restricted to a softer surface. 
Therefore, the nut should be made of softer 
material. This protects the screw against wear. 
Cast variety of phosphor bronze of Grade-1 
(Sut = 190 N/mm2) is selected as the material 
for the nut. Phosphor bronze is soft compared 
with hardened steel screw. In addition to 
this consideration, phosphor bronze has 
low coefﬁ cient of friction, which reduces 
the torque to overcome friction at the thread 
surface. It has excellent conformability and 
machinability. Conformability is the ability 
of the material to yield and adopt its shape to 
that of the screw. Cost is the main limitation 
of phosphor bronze. For steel screw and 
phosphor bronze nut, the permissible bearing 
pressure (Sb) and coefﬁ cient of friction (m) are 
taken as 10 N/mm2 and 0.1 respectively.
 (iv) The handle is subjected to bending moment. 
The yield strength is the criterion for the 
selection of material. Plain carbon steel of 
grade 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) is selected 
as the material for the handle. 
 
(v) The shape and dimensions of the cup are 
such that it is easier and economical to 
make it by the casting process. Grey cast 
iron of Grade FG 200 is used for the cup. 
The complete part list of the screw jack is given 
in the following table.

Step III General Considerations
 
(i) The screw jack is manually operated. 
According to ergonomists, hand force 
should not exceed 130 N. However, this 
value is recommended for prolonged work. 
The jack is never operated continuously 
and, as such, a higher value of 400 N is 
assumed for hand force in this analysis. 
It is further assumed that two workers 
are required to raise the load of 100 kN. 
When two workers are at work, there is 
inconvenience and the resultant force is less 
than twice the individual force. A coefﬁ cient 
of 0.9 is assumed in this case to account for 
reduction in force due to inconvenience. 
Therefore, total hand force exerted on the 
handle by two workers (P) is given by 
 
 
P = (0.9 ¥ 2 ¥ 400) N
 
(ii) A screw-jack is a lifting device and subject 
to certain hazards. Breakdown of the jack 
has serious consequences such as injury 
to the operator and damage to machine 
parts. The jack should be robust and ‘idiot’ 
proof. To account for this safety aspect, a 
higher factor of safety of 5 is used for the 
components of the screw jack.
Step IV Design of Screw
The  screw jack is an intermittently used device and 
wear of the threads is not an important consideration. 
Therefore, instead of trapezoidal threads, the screw 
is provided with square threads. Square threads have 
higher efﬁ ciency and provision can be made for self-
locking arrangement. When the condition of self-
locking is fulﬁ lled, the load itself will not turn the 
screw and descend down, unless the handle is rotated 
in reverse direction with some effort.

 The portion of the screw between the handle and 
the nut is subjected to maximum stress, when the load 
is being raised. The screw is subjected to torsional 
moment, compressive force and bending moment 
which is illustrated in Fig. 6.19. The screw is made of 
plain carbon steel (Syt = 400 N/mm2). Assuming

There are additional stresses due to torsional and

to account for these stresses. As a ﬁ rst trial, a square 
threaded screw with 60 mm nominal diameter and 
9 mm pitch (Table 6.1) is selected.

From Eqs (6.1) and (6.2),

The coefﬁ cient of friction between the steel 
screw and bronze nut is normally taken as 0.1. 
The maximum possible value of the coefﬁ cient 
of friction is 0.18. This occurs when the friction 
is maximum on account of poor lubrication. We 
will consider the worst case where the operator is 
careless about the lubrication of the screw.

points with respect to this diagram, 
 
(i) The portion of the screw between the nut 
and the axis of the handle is subjected to 
torque Mt only. 
 
(ii) The portion of the screw between the cup 
and the axis of the handle is subjected to 
torque (Mt)c only.
 (iii) The external torque (P ¥ lh) exerted at the 
axis of the handle consists of addition of Mt 
plus (Mt)c.
 (iv) No cross-section of the screw is subjected 
to addition of Mt plus (Mt)c.

The lifting height of the jack is 500 mm and the 
distance l1 can be assumed as,

stress rather than compressive stress. To be on the 
safe side, we will neglect the compressive stress 
as determined by the equation (ii) and consider the 
effect of combination of torsional shear stress and 
bending stresses as determined by equations (i) and 
(iii) respectively. The principal shear stress at the

Since the factor of safety is more than 5, the 
design is safe. Therefore, the screw with single-

and 9 mm pitch is suitable for the screw jack.
Step V 
Buckling Consideration 
The buckling of columns is discussed in Chapter 
23. Section 23.5 on ‘Buckling of Columns’ explains 
Johnson’s equation and Euler’s equation. When the 
load is raised through a distance of 500 mm, the 
portion of the screw between the nut and the handle 
acts as a column. For the purpose of buckling, the 
length of the column (l) is taken as, 
 
  l = 500 + 50 = 550 mm

The slenderness ratio of the screw is given by,

the critical slenderness ratio (50.53). Therefore, 
the screw should be treated as short column and 
Johnson’s equation is applied (refer to Fig. 23.11).

Step VII Design of Cup 
As shown in Fig. 6.18, the annular area of collar 
friction has an outer diameter of 1.6d. The inner 
diameter is assumed as 0.8d. 
 
 Do = 1.6d = 1.6(60) = 96 mm
 
 Di = 0.8d = 0.8(60) = 48 mm

 (96 + 48) = 720 000 N-mm
The total torque (Mt)t required to raise the load 
is given by,
 (Mt)t = Mt + (Mt)c = 648 316.03 + 720 000
 
= 1 368 316.03 N-mm. 
The external torque, which is exerted by two 
workers is given by,
 
(Mt)t = (0.9 ¥ 2 ¥ 400) ¥ lh 
(ii)
From (i) and (ii),
 
 1 368 316.03 = 0.9 ¥ 2 ¥ 400 ¥ lh
 
 lh = 1900.43 
The length of the handle (lh) is too large and 
impractical. It is, therefore, necessary to change the 
design of the cup and replace the sliding friction 
by rolling friction by using thrust ball bearing. In 
thrust ball bearing, the friction torque (Mt)c is so 
small, that it can be neglected. 
 Thrust ball bearing shown in Fig. 6.22 is suitable 
for a purely axial load. It is a single-direction thrust 
ball bearing, because it can support axial load in 
one direction only, i.e., vertically downward. This 
ball bearing should not be subjected to radial load. 
Single-direction thrust ball bearings are separable 
and the mounting is simple as the components can 
be mounted individually. There are three separable 
parts of this bearing known as a shaft washer, a
Fig. 6.22 Thrust Ball Bearing
housing washer and the ball and cage assembly. 
The mounting of thrust bearing is shown in
Fig. 6.23. The inner diameter of the shaft washer is 
press ﬁ tted in the screw body. The outer diameter of 
the housing washer is press ﬁ tted in the cup. These 
two components are separately mounted before 
ﬁ nal assembly.
Fig. 6.23 Mounting of Thrust Bearing
 The procedure for selection of the ball bearing 
from the manufacturer’s catalogue is explained 
in Section 15.12. The screw jack is intermittently 
used and, as such, the life of the thrust bearing is 
assumed to be 3000 hours. The handle is rotated 
manually and it is not possible to ﬁ nd out the speed 
of rotation accurately. For the purpose of bearing 
212 Design of Machine Elements
selection, it is assumed that the handle rotates at 
10 rpm. Therefore, the life of the bearing in million

The dimensions of the cup are shown in

Step VIII Design of Handle 
The handle is subjected to bending moment. The force 
exerted by two workers on the handle is given by, 
  
P = (0.9 ¥ 2 ¥ 400) N
The handle is made of steel 30C8 (Syt = 400

Step IX Safety Aspect
To guard against injury to the workers and prevent 
damage to the machine parts, the following safety 
measures should be taken: 
 
(i)  After fabrication, the mechanical jack 
should be proof tested. In a proof test, the 
jack is loaded to 150% of its rated load 
with the lifting member at approximately 
90% of full extension. After this test, the 
jack should be functional for full extension 
under 100% of the lifting rated load4, 5.
 
(ii) The jack should be provided with a warning. 
A sample of the warning is as follows: 
 
  “WARNING: 
DO 
NOT 
OVERLOAD 
JACK. PLACE LOAD ON CENTRE OF 
CUP ONLY. PLACE THE FRAME OF 
JACK ON HARD LEVEL SURFACE. 
LOAD AND STAND SHALL BE STABLE. 
STUDY, UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW 
ALL INSTRUCTIONS. FAILURE TO 
HEED THIS WARNING MAY RESULT 
IN 
PERSONAL 
INJURY 
AND/OR 
PROPERTY DAMAGE”.
 (iii) The following operational instructions should 
be given in the manual or leaﬂ et of the jack:
 
(a) The jack shall be visually examined 
for general condition before each 
shift or each use, whichever is less 
frequent. 
 
(b) A determination of the load shall be 
made to assure that it is within the load 
rating of the jack. 
 
(c) The jack shall be ﬁ rmly supported at 
the base such that it is stable under 
load. 
 
(d) Operators shall be instructed in proper 
use of the jack.
 
(e) Remove the handle when not in use to 
avoid accidental dislocation of the jack 
and reduce tripping hazard. 
 
(f) Take precautions to ensure that all 
personnel are clear of the load before 
lowering. 
 
(g) Ensure that there is sufﬁ cient swing 
area for the handle. 
 
(h) Off-centre loading of jacks should be 
avoided. 
 (iv) The rated load should be legibly and 
durably marked in a prominent position on 
the jack. 
 
(v) The nut and the thrust ball bearing of the 
jack should be regularly lubricated with 
grease. 
The strength and stability considerations in 
design are no doubt essential for safety. However, 
they are not enough to prevent an accident. It is 
also essential to have personnel involved in the 
use and operation of jack to be careful, competent,

DIFFERENTIAL AND COMPOUND  
SCREWS
There are certain applications where very slow 
advance of the screw is required for ﬁ ne adjustment, 
whereas in some applications very fast advance 
of the screw is desirable. One of the methods to 
achieve small advance of the screw is to reduce the 
pitch. The small pitch results in weak threads. The 
rapid movement of the screw is usually obtained 
by using multi-start threads. Increasing number of 
starts affects the self-locking property. To overcome 
these difﬁ culties, differential and compound screws 
are used.
A differential screw is deﬁ ned as a mechanical 
device consisting of two screws in series, which 
are arranged in such a way that the resultant 
motion is the difference of individual motions of

the two screws. The principle of differential screw 
is explained with the help of Fig. 6.26(a). The 
composite screw consists of two parts—the larger 
part S1 with a pitch of 4 mm and the smaller part 
S2 with a 3 mm pitch. The hand of helix for the 
two threads is same, both being right-handed. The 
larger part S1 moves through the frame F. There is 
a square nut N on the smaller part S2. The rotation 
of the nut is prevented as illustrated in Fig. 6.26(c) 
and it can only slide in an axial direction with 
respect to the frame.
The handle is turned through one revolution in 
the clockwise direction when viewed from the right 
side. According to the right-hand thumb rule, when 
the ﬁ ngers are kept in the direction of rotation, 
the thumb indicates the direction of movement of 
the screw. The direction of movement of the nut 
is opposite to that of the screw. The screw S1 will 
move through 4 mm to the left with respect to the 
frame. The nut N will move through 3 mm to the 
right relative to the frame. The resultant motion of 
the nut with respect to the frame will be (4-3) mm 
to the left. In general, if p1 and p2 are the pitches 
for two screws, the resultant motion is equal to
(p1 – p2) or the difference of the individual motions 
of the two screws. 
A compound screw is deﬁ ned as a mechanical 
device consisting of two screws in series, which 
are arranged in such a way that the resultant 
motion is the sum of individual motions of the two 
screws. The compound screw is shown in of Fig. 
6.26(b). The arrangement is similar to that of a 
differential screw, except for the hand of helix for 
the two screws. The threads on the larger part S1 
are right-handed while those on the smaller part S2 
are left handed. It can be proved that the resultant 
movement of the nut with respect to the frame is (4 
+ 3) mm to the left. In general, if p1 and p2 are the 
pitches for two screws, the resultant motion is equal 
to (p1 + p2) or the sum of the individual motions of 
the two screws.
Example 6.11 
A differential type of screw jack 
is shown in Fig. 6.27. In this construction, the two 
screws do not rotate and the nut is rotated by the 
operator by applying a force of 100 N at a mean 
radius of 500 mm. The coefﬁ cient of friction at the 
threads is 0.15. Calculate 
(i) 
the load that can be raised; and
(ii) 
the efﬁ ciency of the screw jack.

6.17 RECIRCULATING BALL SCREW
A recirculating ball screw, as shown in Fig. 6.28, 
consists of a screw and a nut, the surfaces of 
which are separated by a series of balls. The screw 
and the nut have approximately semi-circular 
thread proﬁ les instead of conventional square or 
trapezoidal shape. As the screw is rotated, the balls 
advance in the grooves in the nut and the screw. 
They are collected at the end of the nut and returned 
back. The recirculating ball screw is also called 
ball bearing screw or simply ball screw. Such 
screws are preloaded and give accurate motion due 
to elimination of the backlash. There is no heat 
generation due to negligible friction. Recirculating 
ball screws can be used for high speeds even up to 
10 m/min. The balls, screw and nut are subjected 
to contact stresses. They are usually made of 
nickel chromium steel and heat treated to a surface 
hardness of 58 to 65 HRC. 
216 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 6.28 Recirculating Ball Screw
Compared with conventional power screws, 
recirculating ball screws offer the following 
advantages:
 
(i) In conventional power screw, there is 
sliding friction between the screw and nut 
threads. In recirculating ball screw, there 
is rolling friction between the balls and the 
grooves in the screw and nut. This reduces 
friction drastically. The efﬁ ciency of a 
conventional power screw is as low as 40%. 
The efﬁ ciency of ball screws is as high as 
90%, because sliding friction is replaced by 
rolling friction. 
 
(ii) In conventional power screw, ‘stick-slip’ 
phenomenon is observed due to difference 
between the values of coefﬁ cient of static 
friction and coefﬁ cient of sliding friction. 
It is a serious drawback. In recirculating 
ball screw, it is nearly eliminated and the 
operation is smooth.
 (iii) A conventional power screw must be 
adjusted periodically to compensate for wear 
on the surfaces of the screw and the nut. A 
recirculating ball screw is virtually wear-free 
due to presence of lubricant ﬁ lm between 
the contacting surfaces and protection from 
contamination by dirt particles. 
 (iv) The load carrying capacity of recirculating 
ball screw is more than that of conventional 
power screw. For the same load carrying 
capacity, recirculating ball screw is more 
compact and lightweight than conventional 
screw jack.
Compared with conventional power screws, 
recirculating ball screws has the following 
disadvantages:
 
(i) A recirculating ball screw is much more 
costly than conventional power screw.
 
(ii) Recirculating ball screws are usually 
overhauling due to low friction. Therefore, 
a separate brake is required to hold the load 
in its place.
 (iii) Buckling of screw and critical speed are 
serious problems with recirculating ball 
screw.
 (iv) Recirculating ball screws require a high 
degree of cleanliness compared with 
conventional power screws. They are 
completely enclosed to prevent the entry of 
foreign particles.
 
(v) Recirculating ball screws require a thin ﬁ lm 
of lubricant between the balls and grooves 
in the nut and the screw for satisfactory 
operation. Conventional power screws can 
be easily lubricated by grease.
Recirculating ball screws are used in the 
following applications:
 
(i) Automobile steering gears 
 
(ii) Power actuators 
 (iii) X-Y recorders of CNC machines
 (iv) Aircraft landing gear retractors
 
(v) Hospital bed adjustors
 (vi) Machine tool controls

Threaded Joints
Chapter 7
7.1 THREADED JOINTS
Threaded joint is deﬁ ned as a separable joint of 
two or more machine parts that are held together 
by means of a threaded fastening such as a bolt 
and a nut. The salient features of this deﬁ nition are 
as follows:
 
(i) Threaded joints are used to hold two or more 
machine parts together. These parts can be 
dismantled, if required, without any damage 
to machine parts or fastening. Therefore, 
threaded joints are detachable joints, unlike 
welded joints.
 (ii) Thread is the basic element of these joints. 
The thread is formed by cutting a helical 
groove on the surface of a cylindrical rod or 
cylindrical hole. The threaded element can 
take the shape of bolt and nut, screw or stud. 
Sometimes, threads are cut on the parts to be 
joined. 
Threaded joints are extensively used in 
mechanical assemblies. It has been observed that 
over 60% of the parts have threads. The popularity 
of threaded joints is due to certain advantages 
offered by them. The advantages of threaded joints 
are as follows: 
 
(i) The parts are held together by means of a 
large clamping force. There is wedge action 
at the threads, which increases the clamping 
force. There is no loosening of the parts. 
Therefore, threaded joints are ‘reliable’ 
joints. 
 (ii) The parts are assembled by means of a 
spanner. The length of the spanner is large 
compared with the radius of the thread. 
Therefore, the mechanical advantage is more 
and force required to tighten the joint is 
small.
 (iii) Threaded 
joints 
have 
small 
overall 
dimensions 
resulting 
in 
compact 
construction.
 (iv) The threads are self-locking. Therefore, 
threaded joints can be placed in any 
position—vertical, horizontal or inclined.
 (v) Threaded fasteners are economical to 
manufacture. Their manufacturing is simple. 
High accuracy can be maintained for the 
threaded components.
 (vi) The parts joined together by threaded joints 
can be detached as and when required. 
This requirement is essential in certain 
applications for the purpose of inspection, 
repair or replacement.
 (vii) Threaded fasteners are standardised and 
a wide variety is available for different 
operating conditions and applications.
There are certain disadvantages of threaded 
joints. They are as follows:
 
(i) Threaded joints require holes in the machine 
parts that are to be clamped. This results in 
220 Design of Machine Elements
stress concentration near the threaded portion 
of the parts. Such areas are vulnerable to 
fatigue failure.
 (ii) Threaded joints loosen when subjected to 
vibrations.
 (iii) Threaded fasteners are considered as a major 
obstacle for efﬁ cient assembly. In manual 
assembly, the cost of tightening a screw 
can be six to ten times the cost of the screw 
itself.1 Therefore, Design for Manufacture 
and 
Assembly 
(DFMA) 
recommends 
minimum number of threaded fasteners.
7.2 BASIC TYPES OF SCREW FASTENING
There are three parts of a threaded fastening, viz., 
a bolt or screw, a nut and a washer. There is a basic 
difference between the bolt and the screw. A bolt is 
a fastener with a head and straight threaded shank 
and intended to be used with a nut to clamp two 
or more parts. The same bolt can be called screw 
when it is threaded into a tapped hole in one of 
the parts and not into the nut. Although bolt and 
screw are similar, there is a fundamental difference 
in their assembly. A bolt is held stationary, while 
torque is applied to the nut to make threaded joint, 
whereas the torque is applied to the screw to turn it 
into matching threads in one of the parts. A nut is 
a small symmetrical part, usually having hexagonal 
or square shape, containing matching internal 
threads.
Simple washers are thin annular shaped metallic 
disks. The functions of a washer are as follows:
 
(i) It distributes the load over a large area on the 
surface of clamped parts.
 (ii) It prevents marring of clamped parts during 
assembly.
 (iii) It prevents marring of the bolt head and nut 
surface during assembly.
 (iv) It provides bearing surface over large 
clearance holes.
Threaded fastenings are classiﬁ ed according to 
their shape and the purpose for which they are used. 
Common types of threaded fastenings are as follows:
(i) Through Bolts A  through bolt is simply called a 
‘bolt’ or a ‘bolt and nut’. It is shown in Fig. 7.1(a). 
The bolt consists of a cylindrical rod with head at 
one end and threads at the other. The cylindrical 
portion between the head and the threads is called 
shank. The shank passes through the holes in the 
parts to be fastened. The threaded portion of the bolt 
is screwed into the nut. The head of the bolt and the 
nut are either hexagonal or square. Hexagonal head 
bolt and nut are popular in the machine building 
industry. Square head and nut are used mostly with 
 1  Bart Huthwite—Checklist for DFM—Machine Design—Vol. 62, No. 3—February 1990.

rough type of bolts in construction work. Through 
bolts are used under the following conditions:
 (a) The parts that are fastened have medium 
thickness, e.g., plates, ﬂ anges or beams 
and space is available to accommodate the 
bolt head and the nut. Space should also be 
available to accommodate the spanner to 
tighten the nut.
 (b) The parts that are fastened are made of 
materials, which are too weak to make 
durable threads.
 (c) The parts that are fastened require frequent 
dismantling and reassembly.
The shank of the bolt may or may not have 
ﬁ nished surface. It depends upon the type of force 
induced in the bolt. When the nut is tightened, 
the shank of the bolt is subjected to pure tensile 
force in axial direction. In this case, the shank of 
the bolt can be rough. The only requirement is 
that it should pass easily through the holes in the 
parts. In some applications like rigid coupling, 
the shank is subjected to shear force, which is 
perpendicular to its axis and which tends to slide 
one part with respect to the other. In such cases, 
the shank is machined and passes through rimmed 
holes. Therefore, the bolt is ﬁ nger tight in the 
holes. Depending upon the usage, through bolts are 
called machine bolts, automobile bolts, eyebolts or 
carriage bolts. A machine bolt has rough shank. 
The head and the nut of the machine bolt may be 
rough or ﬁ nished as per requirement. Commercial 
machine bolts are available in sizes from 5 mm to 
75 mm nominal diameter. An automobile bolt has 
ﬁ ne threads. It is ﬁ nished all over. The thickness 
of the hexagonal head and the nut is small in this 
case. Such bolts are available in sizes from 5 mm to 
40 mm nominal diameter. The head is often 
provided with a slot for the purpose of tightening 
by means of a screwdriver. An automobile bolt 
can have ordinary hexagonal nut or castle nut. A 
carriage bolt is used when the head must rest against 
a wooden surface. The part of the shank near the 
head has square cross-section. This prevents the bolt 
from turning when the nut is tightened.
Through bolts do not require tapping of threads 
in the parts that are fastened. However, they are 
inconvenient in assembly operation. Projections of 
head or nut give a bad appearance to the product.
(ii) Tap Bolts and Cap Screws There is a basic 
difference between through bolt and  tap bolt. The 
tap bolt is turned into a threaded (tapped) hole in 
one of the parts being connected and not into a 
nut. On the other hand, the through bolt is turned 
into the nut. Tap bolt is shown in Fig. 7.1(b). Cap 
screws are similar to tap bolts. However, they 
are available in small sizes from 5 mm to 30 mm 
nominal diameter and they have a variety of shapes 
for their head. Tap bolts or cap screws are used 
under the following three conditions: 
 (a) one of the parts is thick enough to 
accommodate a threaded hole; 
 (b) the material of the part with threaded hole 
has sufﬁ cient strength to ensure durable 
threads; and
 (c) there is no place to accommodate the nut.
The relative advantages and disadvantages of 
tap bolt compared with through bolt are as follows:
 (a) Tap bolt and cap screw are cheaper than 
through bolt.
 (b) When a tap bolt or cap screw is subjected 
to shear force perpendicular to its axis, it 
carries the load to the root area of the thread. 
On the other hand, a through bolt carries a 
corresponding load to larger shank area.
 (c) When the tap bolt or cap screw is removed 
frequently, the threads in the part get worn 
out resulting in costly repairs. In case of 
through bolts, there are no threads in any of 
the parts being fastened.
Tap bolts and cap screws are good for fastening 
the parts that are seldom dismantled.
(iii) Studs A  stud is a cylindrical rod threaded 
at both ends. One end of the stud is screwed into 
the tapped hole in one of the connecting parts. The 
other end of the stud receives a nut. A stud joint is 
shown in Fig. 7.1(c). Stud joints are used under the 
following conditions:
 (a) One of the parts is thick enough to 
accommodate a threaded hole.
 (b) The material of the part with threaded hole has 
sufﬁ cient strength to ensure durable threads.
222 Design of Machine Elements
 
(c) The material of the other part, without 
tapped hole, cannot ensure sufﬁ cient 
durability of the threads, e.g., light alloy 
or cast iron. 
 
(d) The parts that are connected require 
frequent dismantling and reassembly.
Studs are particularly used for connecting 
cylinder with the cylinder head.
7.3 CAP SCREWS
As mentioned in the previous article,  cap screws 
belong to the category of tap bolts. Cap screws 
differ from tap bolt in the following respects:
 
(i) Cap screws are small compared with tap 
bolt.
 (ii) A wide variety of shapes are available for 
the head of cap screw. On the other hand, tap 
bolt has hexagonal or square head.
Cap screws with different types of heads are 
illustrated in Fig. 7.2.
Depending upon the shape of the head, cap 
screws are divided into the following two groups:
 
(i) cap screws in which the head is engaged 
externally by a spanner; and
 (ii) cap screws in which the head is engaged 
internally and from the end face.
A cap screw with hexagonal head, shown in 
Fig. 7.2(a), is tightened externally by means of 
a spanner. On the other hand, a cap screw with a 
hexagonal socket head is tightened by a socket 
wrench in a counter bored hole. It belongs to the 
second category.
Hexagonal and square heads are used in ordinary 
applications. The normal height of hexagonal or 
square head is (0.7d) where d is the major diameter 
of the thread on the screw. Head of increased height 
is used for the screws, which are frequently turned 
in and out. Head with decreased height up to (0.5d) 
is used when the screw is infrequently turned in 
and out. Hexagonal head differs from square head 
in the following respects:
 
(i) Hexagonal and square heads require space 
for turning the spanner. However, hexagonal 
head requires a relatively small angle of 
rotation for the spanner than a square head. 
Theoretically, the angle of rotation for 
hexagonal head is one-sixth of a revolution 
to enable the next pair of ﬂ ats to be engaged. 
In case of square head, the angle of rotation 
is one-fourth of a revolution at a time. 
Therefore, square head requires more space 
than hexagonal head for the rotation of the 
spanner.
 (ii) For the same overall dimensions, square 
head has wider faces than hexagonal head, 
enabling a higher tightening torque to be 
transmitted. Alternatively, for the same 
torque, wider faces have a longer life.
Square head cap screws are used in jigs and 
ﬁ xtures, where the screw is often turned in and 
out and there is sufﬁ cient space to turn the spanner 
through large angle.
Cap screw heads, which are tightened internally 
and from the end face are shown in Fig. 7.2(b), 
Fig. 7.2 Cap Screws with Different Heads: (a) Hexagonal (b) Filister (c) Button (d) Flat (e) Fexagonal Socket Head
Threaded Joints 223
(c), (d) and (e). They are called ﬁ llister, button, 
ﬂ at, and hexagonal socket heads. A ﬁ llister head 
cap screw has cylindrical head with a slot for the 
screwdriver. A button head cap screw has spherical 
head with similar slot for the screwdriver. A ﬂ at 
head cap screw has conical head with a slot. 
Heads with the slot for the screwdriver are used 
for cap screws of small sizes, which require small 
torque for tightening. Fillister heads are used for 
cap screws with the head sunk in a counterbore. 
If the head is to be ﬂ ush with the surface and the 
part being fastened has insufﬁ cient thickness to 
accommodate a ﬁ llister head, a cap screw with ﬂ at 
head is employed. When it is not possible to sink 
the head and a better appearance is required, cap 
screws with button or round head are used.
Cap screw with hexagonal socket head is shown 
in Fig. 7.2(e). These cap screws are tightened by 
a simple wrench made of hexagonal bar bent at 
right angles. The important advantage of cap screw 
with hexagonal socket head is that the maximum 
tightening torque permitted by the socket wrench 
corresponds to the strength of the screw. Therefore, 
the head cannot be twisted off during tightening. 
Cap screws with heads engaged internally and from 
the end face have the following advantages:
 
(i) Such cap screws can be installed in conﬁ ned 
spaces and in counter bored holes.
 (ii) They result in better appearance for the 
product.
 (iii) They reduce the overall dimensions of the 
product resulting in compact construction.
 (iv) There is convenience in cleaning or wiping 
off the surface of the product.
7.4 SETSCREWS
Setscrew is used to prevent relative motion between 
two parts. The threaded portion of the  setscrew 
passes through a tapped hole in one of the parts 
and the end of the screw presses against the other 
part. The end of the screw is called the point of the 
screw. The friction between the point and the part 
to be held prevents relative motion of that part with 
respect to the part through which the setscrew is 
screwed. Setscrew can be used instead of key to 
prevent relative motion between the hub and the 
shaft in small power transmission. Setscrews differ 
from cap screws in the following respects: 
 
(i) Setscrews are subjected to compressive force 
only. Cap screws are subjected to tensile and 
shear forces.
 (ii) Setscrew transmits force from threaded 
component to the other mating component 
by means of screw point. In cap screw, the 
force is transmitted by the head.
 (iii) Setscrews are short and threaded over full 
length of the shank compared with the cap 
screws.
Setscrews with different types of points and 
heads are illustrated in Fig. 7.3. Some setscrews 
have hexagonal or square head as shown in
Fig. 7.3(b) and (c), but the majority do not have 
heads. Usually, they have a slot for the screwdriver 
as shown in Fig. 7.3(a) and (e) or a hexagonal 
Fig. 7.3 Types of Set Screws
socket shown in Fig. 7.3(d). Setscrew used in 
rotating parts has no head. On the other hand, 
setscrew for stationary parts may have hexagonal or 
square heads. The types of point used in setscrew 
are as follows:
(i) Flat Point (Fig. 7.3 a) Flat point is used when 
the lateral force, which tends to displace one part 
with respect to another, is randomly applied. It is 
also used when the part with tapped hole into which 
224 Design of Machine Elements
the setscrew is screwed, does not have sufﬁ cient 
thickness.
(ii) Dog Point (Fig. 7.3 b) Dog point is used 
when the lateral force, which tends to displace one 
part with respect to other, is large. Also the part, 
which is held, should have sufﬁ cient thickness to 
accommodate a cylindrical hole for the dog point.
(iii) Cone Point (Fig. 7.3 c) Cone point is used 
when the lateral force is small. Also, the part with 
the tapped hole into which the setscrew is screwed, 
does not have sufﬁ cient thickness. The part being 
held is provided with conical hole.
(iv) Hanger Point (Fig. 7.3 d) Hanger point has a 
small taper. It is used when the lateral force is large. 
Also the part, which is held, should have sufﬁ cient 
thickness to accommodate a cylindrical hole. 
Hanger point ensures good location of the part.
(v) Cut Point (Fig. 7.3 e) Cut point is used when 
the part being held cannot be drilled or hardened. 
It is also used to transmit force to steel balls or 
spherical parts.
The point of the setscrew is generally hardened.
7.5  BOLT OF UNIFORM STRENGTH
Bolts are subjected to shock and impact loads 
in certain applications. The bolts of cylinder 
head of an internal combustion engine or the 
bolts of connecting rod are the examples of such 
applications. In such cases, resilience of the bolt is 
important design consideration to prevent breakage 
at the threads. Resilience is deﬁ ned as the ability 
of the material to absorb energy when deformed 
elastically and to release this energy when 
unloaded. A resilient bolt absorbs energy within 
elastic range without any permanent deformation 
and releases this energy when unloaded. It can be 
called spring property of the bolt. A resilient bolt 
absorbs shocks and vibrations like leaf springs 
of the vehicle. In other words, the bolt acts like a 
spring. 
It can be shown that the energy absorbed during 
elastic deformation is proportional to the square of 
the stress induced in the material and the volume of 
the material under the stress. Figure 7.4(a) shows an 
ordinary bolt with usual shape. The major diameter 
of the thread as well as the diameter of the shank 
is d. The core diameter of the threads is dc. When 
this bolt is subjected to tensile force, there are two 
distinct regions of stress. They are as follows:
 
(i) The diameter of threaded portion dc 
is less than the shank diameter d. The 
threaded portion is also subjected to stress 
concentration. Therefore, stress induced in 
the threaded portion is more than the stress 
in the shank portion. The energy absorbed 
by each unit volume of bolt material is 
proportional to the square of the stress. 
Hence, a large part of the energy is absorbed 
in the threaded portion of the bolt.
 (ii) The diameter of the shank is more than the 
core diameter of the threaded portion. There 
is no stress concentration in the shank. 
Therefore, when the bolt is subjected to 
tensile force, the stress in the shank portion 
is less than the stress in the threaded portion. 
The energy absorbed in the shank, which is 
proportional to the square of the stress, is 
less than the energy absorbed in the threaded 
part.
The shock absorbing capacity of bolt can be 
increased if the shank of bolt is turned down to a 
diameter equal to the root diameter of threads or 
even less. In this case, the shank is subjected to 
higher stress and hence absorbs a greater proportion 
of strain energy and relieves the thread portion of 
high stress. The resilience of the bolt can also be 
increased by increasing its length. The strain energy 
absorbed by the shank is linearly proportional to 
its length. Therefore, there are two methods for 
increasing the shock absorbing capacity of bolts. 
They are as follows:
 
(i) Reduce the shank diameter to core diameter 
of threads or even less.
 (ii) Increase the length of the shank portion of 
the bolt.
The threaded portion of the bolt is the weakest 
part and maximum amount of elastic energy is 
absorbed in this region. The ideal bolt will be one 
Threaded Joints 225
which is subjected to same stress level at different 
cross-sections in the bolt. It is called the bolt of 
uniform strength. In a bolt of uniform strength, the 
entire bolt is stressed to the same limiting value, 
thus resulting in maximum energy absorption. 
There are two ways to reduce the cross-sectional 
area of the shank and convert an ordinary bolt into 
a bolt of uniform strength. They are illustrated in 
Fig. 7.4(b) and (c). One method is to reduce the 
diameter of the shank as shown in Fig. 7.4(b). In 
another method, the cross-sectional area of the 
shank is reduced by drilling a hole, as illustrated 
in Fig. 7.4(c). Both methods reduce cross-sectional 
area of the shank and increase stress and energy 
absorption. In the ﬁ rst method, the diameter of
Fig. 7.4 Bolts of Uniform Strength
the shank is usually reduced to the core diameter 
of the threads. Therefore, the cross-sectional area 
of the shank is equal to the cross-sectional area of 
the threaded portion. When this bolt is subjected to 
tensile force, the stress in the shank and the stress 
in the threaded portion are equal. In the second 
method, the diameter of the hole (d1) is obtained 
by equating the cross-sectional area of the shank to 
that of the threaded part. Therefore,

Machining a long hole is difﬁ cult operation 
compared with turning down the shank diameter. 
Drilled hole results in stress concentration. 
Therefore, a bolt with reduced shank diameter is 
preferred over a bolt with an axial hole.
7.6 LOCKING DEVICES
The threads used on all screw fastenings satisfy 
the condition of self-locking. The helix angle for 
metric threads with 6 to 68 mm major diameter 
varies in the range from 3°30¢ to 1°40¢. The helix 
angle is considerably less than the angle of friction. 
In addition, there is friction at the bearing surfaces 
of the nut and the head of the bolt. Therefore, 
loosening of the threads between the bolt and nut 
should not occur under normal working conditions. 
Ordinary threaded fastenings remain tight under 
the action of static loads. However, many of these 
fastenings become loose when subjected to cyclic 
and impact loads. Loosening is due to the reduction 
of friction force in the threads due to consecutive 
expansion and contraction of the bolt resulting 
from ﬂ uctuating axial load. It is also due to elastic 
vibrations along the axis of the screw. In many 
applications, vibrations are the main cause of 
loosening of the threads. Locking devices are used 
to prevent the loosening of the threads between the 
nut and the screw. Locking can be accomplished by 
the following three methods:
 
(i) by creating supplementary friction;
 (ii) by using special locking devices like split-
pin; and
 (iii) by plastic deformation.
A large number of locking devices are available 
in practice. Only some of them are described in this 
article.
The most common method to lock the threads 
is to use a  jam nut, i.e., a second nut as shown in 
Fig. 7.5. It is also called a locknut. The procedure of 
locking the threads consists of the following steps:
 
(i) The lower nut is ﬁ rst tightened down with 
normal force.
226 Design of Machine Elements
 (ii) The upper nut is then tightened down upon 
the lower nut.
 (iii) The upper nut is held with spanner and the 
lower nut is slackened back against it by 
another spanner.
Fig. 7.5 Jam Nut
The tightening of lower nut against the surface 
of the upper nut creates additional friction at the 
contacting interface. This force of friction does not 
depend on the external force applied to the joint. 
After the assembly, the upper nut, called the jam 
nut, carries the main axial load. The tightening 
force and friction force in the threads of the lower 
nut, called the main nut, are reduced. The joint 
remains tight because of the friction between the 
surfaces of the two nuts, even when the axial force 
on the bolt is relieved.
Another common method to obtain positive 
locking of threads is to use a  castle nut with a split 
pin. It is shown in Fig. 7.6. The castle nut consists 
of the usual hexagonal nut but with an addition 
of upper cylindrical part. This cylindrical portion 
has six slots located at the centre of each face of 
the hexagonal part. Due to these slots, castle nut is 
sometimes called a slotted nut. A split pin is passed 
through diametrically opposite slots in the castle 
nut and a hole in the bolt. This ensures positive 
locking unless the pin gets sheared. The split pin 
consists of a wire of semicircular cross-section. It 
is bent over in such a way that its ﬂ at sides are in 
contact. The split pin has a looped head on one side. 
The two ends at the other side can be separated and 
bent back over the cylindrical portion of the castle 
nut. A castle nut is extensively used for joints that 
are subjected to vibrations. They are popular in the 
automobile industry.
Fig. 7.6 Castle Nut
A  split nut is shown in Fig. 7.7. It is similar to 
ordinary hexagonal nut but with a saw cut. A cap 
screw is provided to tighten or loosen the two parts 
of the nut separated by the saw cut. Initially, the 
nut is tightened on the screw and then the slot is 
opened by means of the cap screw. Opening of the 
slot results in deformation of nut and introduces 
additional friction at the threads. This prevents 
loosening of the nut.
Fig. 7.7 Split nut
A positive locking arrangement with the help 
of setscrew is shown in Fig. 7.8. The elastic piece 
is made of soft material like copper or lead. It 
prevents damage to the threads when the setscrew 
is tightened in the nut. This arrangement results in 
additional friction between the threads of the bolt 
and the elastic piece and prevents loosening.
Threaded Joints 227
Fig. 7.8 Locking with Setscrew
Locking by  spring washer is common method 
to prevent loosening of threads. The spring washer 
consists of a ring made of hardened steel with a cut 
at an angle of 15° with the ring axis as shown in 
Fig. 7.9(b). The ends of the washer at the cut are 
slightly separated and provided with sharp teeth. 
During tightening, the spring washer is compressed 
and its teeth bite into the contacting surface of the 
nut on one side and the base on the other. Thus, the 
nut gets ﬁ xed in the base. The principle of locking 
by means of spring washer is illustrated in Fig. 
7.9(c). The action of the spring washer is more 
effective when the contacting surfaces are soft. The 
cut in the spring washer has ‘left-hand’ inclination 
for right-hand threads and ‘right-hand’ inclination 
for left-hand threads.
Fig. 7.9 Locking with Spring Washer
7.7 
TERMINOLOGY OF SCREW THREADS
The right-hand threads are always used unless there 
is special reason for requiring left-hand thread. 
Unless and otherwise stated, speciﬁ cations for 
threads imply right-hand threads. When the screw 
is vertical, the thread lines slope upward from left 
to right in case of right-hand threads. On the other 
hand, the thread lines slope downward from left to 
right in case of left-hand threads.
Various dimensions of external and internal threads 
are illustrated in Fig. 7.10. They are as follows:
Fig. 7.10 Terminology of Threads
(i) Major Diameter The major diameter is the 
diameter of an imaginary cylinder that bounds 
the crest of an external thread (d) or the root of 
an internal thread (D). The major diameter is the 
largest diameter of the screw thread. It is also called 
the nominal diameter of the thread.
228 Design of Machine Elements
(ii) Minor Diameter The minor diameter is the 
diameter of an imaginary cylinder that bounds 
the roots of an external thread (dc) or the crest of 
an internal thread (Dc). The minor diameter is the 
smallest diameter of the screw thread. It is also 
called core or root diameter of the thread.
(iii) Pitch Diameter The pitch diameter is the 
diameter of an imaginary cylinder, the surface of 
which would pass through the threads at such points 
as to make the width of the threads equal to the 
width of spaces cut by the surface of the cylinder. 
It is also called the effective diameter of the thread. 
Pitch diameter is denoted by dp for external threads 
and Dp for internal threads.
(iv) Pitch Pitch is the distance between two similar 
points on adjacent threads measured parallel to the 
axis of the thread. It is denoted by the letter p.
(v) Lead Lead is the distance that the nut moves 
parallel to the axis of the screw, when the nut is 
given one turn.
(vi) Thread Angle Thread angle is the angle 
included between the sides of the thread measured 
in an axial plane. Thread angle is 60o for ISO 
metric threads.
(vii) Tensile Stress Area It has been observed 
during testing of the threaded rods that an 
unthreaded rod, having a diameter equal to the 
mean of the pitch diameter and the minor diameter 
[i.e., (dp + dc)/2] has the same tensile strength as 
the threaded rod. The cross-sectional area of this 
unthreaded rod is called the ‘tensile-stress area’. 
This area is used for the purpose of calculating the 
tensile strength of the bolts.
7.8 ISO METRIC SCREW THREADS
Fastening threads are usually vee threads. They 
offer the following advantages:
 
(i) Vee threads result in higher friction, which 
lessen the possibility of loosening.
 (ii) Vee threads have higher strength due to 
increased thread thickness at the core 
diameter.
 (iii) Vee threads are more convenient to 
manufacture.
The proﬁ le of an  ISO metric screw thread 
is illustrated in Fig. 7.112, 3. It consists of an 
equilateral triangle with a thread angle of 60°. 
The base of this triangle is equal to the pitch. The 
Fig. 7.11 Proﬁ le of Internal and External Threads
 2 IS 4218–1976: ISO Metric screw threads (in four parts)
 3 ISO 68–ISO General purpose screw threads—Basic proﬁ le
Threaded Joints 229
dimensions of the standard proﬁ le are given in 
Tables 7.1 and 7.2. It is observed from the tooth 
proﬁ le that the crests and the roots of the threads 
are either ﬂ attened or rounded to a circular arc. This 
is essential in fastening threads. It has the following 
advantages:
 
(i) It reduces the stress concentration in threads.
 (ii) It increases the tool life of the thread cutting 
tool.
 (iii) It reduces the possibility of damaging the 
threads by denting.
 (iv) In ﬂ uid tight threads, it prevents leakage 
because there is engagement in the threads 
on crests and roots.
Metric threads are divided into coarse and ﬁ ne 
series. The thread proﬁ les in these two cases are 
generally similar. The  coarse thread is considered as 
the basic series. Coarse threads offer the following 
advantages:
 
(i) The static load carrying capacity of coarse 
threads is higher.
 (ii) Coarse threads are easier to cut than ﬁ ne 
threads.
 (iii) The errors in manufacturing and wear have 
less effect on the strength of coarse threads 
than that of  ﬁ ne threads.
 (iv) Coarse threads are less likely to seize during 
tightening.
 (v) Coarse threads have more even stress 
distribution.
Fine threads offer the following advantages:
 
(i) Fine threads have greater strength when 
subjected to ﬂ uctuating loads.
 (ii) Fine threads have greater resistance to

Therefore, threads with ﬁ ne pitch are more

230 Design of Machine Elements
Coarse threads are recommended for general 
industrial applications, which are free from 
vibrations. Fine threads are used in the following 
applications:
 
(i) The parts subjected to dynamic loads and 
vibrations, e.g., automobile applications.
 (ii) Hollow thin walled parts, where coarse 
threads are liable to weaken the wall 
considerably.

7.9 MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURE
Lightly loaded small bolts, studs and nuts are made 
of free cutting steels. High strength bolts often fail 
in fatigue. They are made of plain carbon steels 
like 40C8 or 45C8 or alloy steels like 35Mn6Mo3, 
40Cr4Mo2, 40Ni14 or 40Ni10Cr3Mo6. Stainless 
steel is used for threaded fastener where corrosion 
resistance is required.
The head of the bolt or screw is made by the 
upsetting process. This is done on automatic 
forging machines, which give ﬁ nished shape with 
practically no scrap. The head is cold formed for 
diameters up to 20 mm. For larger diameters, hot 
forming is employed. 
Threaded Joints 231
There are two methods for making threads, viz., 
thread cutting and thread rolling. Thread cutting 
is done on automatic machines called ‘screw’ 
machines. In the thread rolling method, threads are 
formed by rolling the bar stock between dies which 
depress part of the material to form the root of the 
thread and which force the remaining material up 
the top to form the crest of threads. Therefore, the 
outside diameter of the thread is more than the bar 
stock on which it was rolled. Thread rolling is a 
superior method of making threads. The advantages 
of thread rolling over thread cutting are as follows:
 
(i) Cold forming induces residual compressive 
stresses on the thread surface, which 
improve fatigue strength of the bolt.
 (ii) Cold forming creates radii at the root and the 
crest and reduces stress concentration.
 (iii) Thread cutting results in cutting the ﬁ bre 
lines of the original bar stock. In thread 
rolling, the ﬁ bre lines are rearranged to suit 
the thread shape.
 (iv) Compared with cut threads, rolled threads 
have less waste as no material is removed.
All these factors contribute to increased popularity 
of rolled threads as compared to cut threads.
7.10 BOLTED JOINT—SIMPLE ANALYSIS
A bolted joint subjected to tensile force P is shown 
in Fig. 7.12. The cross-section at the core diameter 
dc is the weakest section. The maximum tensile 
stress in the bolt at this cross-section is given by,

(7.2)
The height of the nut h can be determined by 
equating the strength of the bolt in tension with 
the strength in shear. The procedure is based on the 
following assumptions:
 
(i) Each turn of the thread in contact with the 
nut supports an equal amount of load.
 (ii) There is no stress concentration in the 
threads.
 (iii) The yield strength in shear is equal to half of 
the yield strength in tension (Ssy = 0.5Syt). 
 (iv) Failure occurs in the threads of the bolt and 
not in the threads of the nut.
Substituting,

(a)
The threads of the bolt in contact with the nut 
are sheared at the core diameter dc. The shear area 
is equal to (p dc h), where h is the height of the nut.

(b)
Equating (a) and (b),
 
    h = 0.5dc
Assuming (dc = 0.8d),
 
h = 0.4d
Therefore, for standard coarse threads, the 
threads are equally strong in failure by shear 
and failure by tension, if the height of the nut is 
approximately 0.4 times of the nominal diameter 
of the bolt. The height of the standard hexagonal 
nut is (0.8d). Hence, the threads of the bolt in the 
standard nut will not fail by shear.
232 Design of Machine Elements
Rewriting the height of the standard nut,
 
h = 0.8d 
(7.3) 
The design of the bolt consists of determination 
of correct size of the bolt. The size of the bolt is 
given by the nominal diameter d and pitch p. In 
design calculations, many times the core diameter 
dc is determined. Therefore, it is necessary to 
convert the core diameter dc into the nominal 
diameter d. This can be easily done when the 
tables like (7.1) and (7.2) are available. Knowing 
the minor or core diameter, the corresponding 
designation of the thread can be obtained from 
these tables. However, when the tables for threads 
are not available, some relationship between dc and 
d has to be used. The correct relationship for ISO 
metric screw threads is as follows4,
 
dc = d – 1.226 87p
Since there are two unknowns on the right hand 
side, it is not possible to ﬁ nd out the value of d by 
knowing the value of dc. Therefore, the following 
approximate relationship can be used,
 
dc = 0.8d 
(7.4)
Preference should be given to use values given 
in Tables 7.1 and 7.2.
Example 7.1 An electric motor weighing 10 kN 
is lifted by means of an eye bolt as shown in Fig. 
7.13. The eye bolt is screwed into the frame of the 
motor. The eye bolt has coarse threads. It is made 
of plain carbon steel 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) and 
the factor of safety is 6. Determine the size of the 
bolt.

Solution
Given P = 10 kN Syt = 400 N/mm2

Eye bolt is used for lifting and transporting 
heavy machinery on the shop ﬂ oor. It consists of 
a ring of circular cross-section at the top end and 
threaded portion at the lower end. The threaded 
portion is screwed inside a threaded hole on the top 
surface of the machine to be lifted. A crane hook 
or chain is inserted in the circular ring. The circular 
ring is called the eye. The threaded portion of the 
eye bolt is subjected to tensile stress due to the 
weight being lifted.

indicate the position of bolt-centres with respect to
Fig. 7.15

Fig. 7.17 Primary and Secondary Shear Forces
The primary and secondary shear forces are 
added by vector addition method to get the resultant 
shear forces P1, P2, P3, and P4. In this analysis, it 
is assumed that the components connected by the 
bolts are rigid and the bolts have the same cross-
sectional area.
Example 7.3 The structural connection shown 
in Fig. 7.16 is subjected to an eccentric force P of 
10 kN with an eccentricity of 500 mm from the CG 
of the bolts. The centre distance between bolts 1 
and 2 is 200 mm, and the centre distance between 
bolts 1 and 3 is 150 mm. All the bolts are identical. 
The bolts are made from plain carbon steel 30C8 
(Syt = 400 N/mm2) and the factor of safety is 2.5. 
Determine the size of the bolts.

TO AXIS OF BOLT
A bracket, ﬁ xed to the steel structure by means of 
four bolts, is shown in Fig. 7.20(a). It is subjected 
to eccentric force P at a distance e from the 
structure. The force P is perpendicular to the axis 
of each bolt. The lower two bolts are denoted by 2, 
while the upper two bolts by 1. In this analysis, the 
following assumptions are made:
 
(i) The bracket and the steel structure are rigid.
 (ii) The bolts are ﬁ tted in reamed and ground 
holes.
236 Design of Machine Elements
 (iii) The bolts are not preloaded and there are no 
tensile stresses due to initial tightening.
 (iv) The stress concentration in threads is 
neglected.
 (v) All bolts are identical.

The force P results in direct shear force on the 
bolts. Since the bolts are identical, the shear force

The moment (P ¥ e) tends to tilt the bracket

each bolt is stretched by an amount (d) which is

proportional to its distance from the tilting edge.

in Fig. 7.22(a). Assume the following data:
l1 = 300 mm l2 = 200 mm 
l3 = 100 mm
l = 250 mm 
P = 50 kN
Neglecting shear stress, determine the size of the 
bolts, if the maximum permissible tensile stress in

Threaded Joints 239
Solution
Given P = 50 kN l = 250 mm
(s1)max. = 100 N/mm2
Step I Maximum tensile force
The force P tends to tilt the bracket about edge C. 
Each bolt is stretched by an amount (d), which is 
proportional to its distance from the tilting edge as 
shown in Fig. 7.22 (b).

Also,
force µ stress 
because 
(P = sA)

because

because 
(Œ = d/l)
Therefore, it can be concluded that the force 
induced in any bolt due to the tendency of the 
bracket to tilt about the edge C is proportional to its 
distance from the tilting edge. Therefore,
P1 = Cl1 
P2 = Cl2  
P3 = Cl3

The bolts are subjected to tensile stress on 
account of the following two factors:

As shown in Fig. 7.25(b), when the load tends

ECCENTRIC LOAD ON CIRCULAR  
 
BASE
Many times, a machine component is made with 
a circular base, which is fastened to the structure 
by means of bolts located on the circumference 
of a circle. Flanged bearings of the machine 
tools and the structure of the pillar crane are the 
examples of this type of loading. A round ﬂ ange-
bearing fastened by means of four bolts is shown 
in Fig. 7.26(b). It is subjected to an external force 
P at a distance l from the support. The following 
assumptions are made:
 
(i) All bolts are identical.
 (ii) The bearing and the structure are rigid.
 (iii) The bolts are not preloaded and there is no 
tensile stress due to initial tightening. 
 (iv) The stress concentration in the threads is 
neglected.
 (v) The bolts are relieved of shear stresses by 
using dowel pins.
As shown in Fig. 7.26(a), when the load tends 
to tilt the bearing about the point C, each bolt is 
stretched by an amount (d), which is proportional 
to its vertical distance from the point C. Or,

Therefore, it can be concluded that the resisting 
force acting on any bolt due to the tendency of the 
bearing to tilt, is proportional to its distance from 
the tilting edge.

Equation (7.16) gives absolute maximum value

be used for ﬁ nding out the size of the bolts, when 
the direction of the external force P can change 
with respect to the bolts, as in case of the base of 
a vertical pillar crane. When the direction of the 
external force P is ﬁ xed and known, the maximum 
load on the bolts can be reduced, so that the two 
of them can be equally stressed as shown in
Fig. 7.26(c). In this particular case, the number of 
bolts is 4 and the angle a made by the centre line of 
bolt 2 is 135°. For a general case with n as number

The above equation is applicable only when two 
bolts are equally stressed. This condition can be 
satisﬁ ed under the following circumstances:
 
(i) the direction of the external force P is ﬁ xed 
with respect to the bolts;
 (ii) the number of bolts is even; and 
 (iii) two bolts at the top are symmetrically spaced 
with angle b on either side of the vertical line. 
The bolts are usually relieved of shear stresses 
by using dowel pins as shown in Fig. 7.26(c).
244 Design of Machine Elements
Example 7.11 A round ﬂ ange bearing, as shown 
in Fig. 7.26(b), is fastened to the machine frame 
by means of four cap screws spaced equally on a 
300 mm pitch circle diameter. The diameter of the 
ﬂ ange is 400 mm. The external force P is 25 kN, 
which is located at a distance of 150 mm from the 
machine frame. There are two dowel pins to take 
shear load. The cap screws are relieved of all 
shear force. Determine the size of the cap screws, 
if the maximum permissible tensile stress in the cap 
screw is limited to 50 N/mm2.
Solution
Given 2a = 400 mm 2b = 300 mm P = 25 kN 
 
l = 150 mm 
(st)max. = 50 N/mm2

Example 7.12 
A pillar crane, shown in Fig. 
7.27, is fastened to the foundation by means of 16 
identical bolts spaced equally on 2 m pitch circle 
diameter. The diameter of the pillar ﬂ ange is 2.25 
m. Determine the size of the bolts if a load of 50 kN 
acts at a radius of 7.5 m from the axis of the crane. 
The maximum permissible tensile stress in the bolt 
is limited to 75 N/mm2.
Fig. 7.27 Pillar Crane
Solution
Given 2a = 2250 mm 2b = 2000 mm P = 50 kN 
 
r = 7500 mm 
(st)max. = 75 N/mm2
Step I Absolute maximum force on bolt
As shown in Fig. 7.27, the tendency of the pillar 
crane is to tilt about the point C under the action of 
the eccentric load P. Therefore, the moment arm l 
for load P about the point C is (r–a). Or, 
l = r – a = 7500 – 1125 = 6375 mm
The pillar crane can rotate about its axis and the 
location of P will change with respect to the bolts. 
Therefore, the bolts are to be designed for absolute 
maximum value of force.

inclined at an angle of 30° with the horizontal. The 
bracket is fastened by means of four identical bolts, 
two at A and two at B. The bolts are made of plain 
carbon steel 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) and the factor 
of safety is 5. Assume maximum shear stress theory

Step II Tensile and shear stresses in bolts
The force P is resolved into horizontal component

are given by,
Ph = P sin 60° = 5000 sin 60° = 4330.13 N
Pv = P cos 60° = 5000 cos 60° = 2500 N
Effect of Ph
The horizontal component Ph is parallel to the 
axis of the bolts. It has following two effects: 
 
(i) a direct tensile force on each bolt; and
 (ii) a turning moment about the centre of gravity 
of four bolts (G) in clockwise direction.
The direct tensile force on each bolt is given by,

As shown in Fig. 7.29, the centre of gravity of 
four bolts is at a distance (60 + 100) or 160 mm 
from the lower edge. The point of application of 
the force Ph is at a distance of 200 mm from the 
lower edge. Therefore, the eccentricity of the force 
Ph is (200–160) or 40 mm about the centre of 
gravity. The turning moment (Mh) due to horizontal 
component is given by, 
Mh = Ph ¥ 40 = 4330.13 ¥ 40
 
= 173 205.2 N-mm 
(ii)
The moment Mh acts in the clockwise direction.
Effect of Pv
The vertical component Pv is perpendicular to 
the axis of the bolts. It has following two effects:
 
(i) a direct shear force on each bolt; and
 (ii) a turning moment about the tilting edge C in 
the clockwise direction.

The distance of the vertical component Pv from

Mv = Pv ¥ 240 = 2500 ¥ 240
 
 
= 600 000 N-mm 
(iv)
The moment Mv acts in the clockwise direction.
It is observed that turning moments due to 
horizontal and vertical components are clockwise 
and the resultant turning moment is obtained by 
their addition. The resisting forces set up in bolts 
1 and 2, are proportional to their distances from 
the tilting edge C. Two bolts, denoted by 1, are at 
the farthest distance from the edge C. Therefore, 
the tensile force due to the tendency of the bracket 
to tilt about the edge C is maximum for two bolts 
denoted by 1.

7.14 TORQUE REQUIREMENT FOR BOLT 
TIGHTENING
A bolted assembly is tightened by applying force to 
the wrench handle and rotating the hexagonal nut. 
In certain applications, as in case of the gasketed 
joint between the cylinder and the cylinder head 
of the engine, the bolts are tightened with a 
speciﬁ c magnitude of pre-load Pi. It is necessary 
to determine the magnitude of the torque which 
will induce this pre-tension. The torque required to 
tighten the bolt consists of the following two factors:
Threaded Joints 249
 
(i) torque required to overcome thread friction 
and induce the pre-load, i.e., (Mt); and 
 (ii) torque required to overcome collar friction 
between the nut and the washer (Mt)c.
The equations derived for trapezoidal threads 
are suitably modiﬁ ed for ISO metric screw threads. 
Replacing W by pretension Pi in Eq. (6.13) (Section 
6.10), the torque required to overcome thread 
friction is given by,

7.15 DIMENSIONS OF FASTENERS 
Fasteners such as hexagonal head bolts, screws, 
washers and nuts are frequently used in all 
design projects. Their standard dimensions 
are essential to prepare assembly and detail 
drawings. However, in previous examples the 
bolts are designed and their standard size such 
M16 or M20 is speciﬁ ed. Other dimensions of 
the fasteners are determined by referring to the 
particular Indian Standard for that fastener. 
Tables 7.3 to 7.5 give dimensions of commonly 
used hexagonal head bolts and screws, hexagonal 
nuts and washers5, 6. The dimensions of other 
fasteners can be similarly obtained from relevant 
standards or handbooks7.
It is observed from these tables that the inner 
diameter of the washer is slightly more than the nut 
size.

7.16 DESIGN OF TURNBUCKLE 
Step I Problem Speciﬁ cation It is required to 
design a  turnbuckle for connecting the tie rods in 
the roof truss. The maximum pull in the tie rods is 
50 kN.
Step II Construction The construction of the 
turnbuckle is shown in Fig. 7.31. It consists of a 
central portion called coupler and two rods. One 
rod has right-hand threads while the other rod has 
left-hand threads. The threaded portions of the 
rods are screwed to the coupler at the two ends. 
As the central coupler rotates, the rods are either 
pulled together or pushed apart depending upon the 
direction of the rotation of the coupler. The outer 
portion of the coupler is given hexagonal shape 
so that it can be rotated by means of a spanner. 
Fig. 7.31 Turnbuckle
Sometimes a hole is provided in the coupler as 
indicated by a dotted circle in the ﬁ gure. Instead 
of using a spanner, a tommy bar is inserted in this 
hole to rotate the coupler. The turnbuckle is used 
for connecting two rods which are in tension and 
which require slight adjustment in length during the 
assembly. Some of its applications are as follows:
 
(i) to tighten the members of the roof truss;
 (ii) to tighten the cables or the stay ropes of 
electric distribution poles ; and 
 (iii) to connect the tie rod to the jib in case of
jib-cranes.
Step III Selection of Materials The coupler 
has 
a 
relatively 
complex 
shape 
and 
the 
economic method to make the coupler is casting 
Casting 
reduces 
the 
number 
of 
machining 
operations. Grey cast iron of grade FG 200
(Sut = 200 N/mm2) is selected as the material for the 
coupler. The rods are subjected to tensile force and 
torsional moment. From strength considerations, 
plain carbon steel of grade 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) 
is selected for the rods. 
Step IV General Considerations Many times, 
turnbuckle is subjected to rough handling in 
use. Sometimes, workers use a pipe to increase 
the length of the spanner and tighten the rods. 
Some workers even use a hammer to apply 
force on the spanner. To account for this ‘miss-
use,’ a higher factor of safety of 5 is used in the 
present design. 
252 Design of Machine Elements
The coupler and the rods are provided with ISO 
metric coarse threads. Coarse threads are preferred 
because of the following advantages:
 
(i) Coarse threads are easier to cut than ﬁ ne 
threads;
 (ii) They are less likely to seize during 
tightening; 
 (iii) There is more even stress distribution.
The rods are tightened by applying force on the 
wrench handle and rotating the hexagonal coupler. 
The expression for torque required to tighten 
the rod with speciﬁ c tension P can be derived by 
suitable modiﬁ cation of the equation derived for 
the trapezoidal threads. The torque required to 
overcome thread friction in case of trapezoidal 
threads is given by Eq. (6.13) of Chapter 6.

Step V Design of Rods The free body diagram of 
forces acting on the rods and the coupler is shown 
in Fig. 7.32. Each rod is subjected to a tensile force 
P and torsional moment Mt. In the initial stages, 
it is not possible to ﬁ nd out torsional moment.

The factor of safety is satisfactory. Therefore, 
the nominal diameter and the pitch of the threaded 
portion of the rod should be 42 mm and 4.5 mm 
respectively. In Fig. 7.31, the length of the threaded 
portion of the rod in contact with coupler threads 
is denoted by l. It is determined by shearing of the 
threads at the minor diameter dc. Equating shear 
resistance of the threads to the tension in the rod,

Therefore,

\ 
l = 10.91 mm 
(i)
This length is too small compared with the 
nominal diameter of 42 mm. In practice, the length 
l varies from d to 1.25 d. Or,
 
l = d = 42 mm
 
l = 1.25 d = 1.25 (42) = 52.5 mm  
(ii)
From (i) and (ii), the length of the threaded 
portion (l) is assumed as 50 mm.
Step VI Design of Coupler The two ends of the 
coupler are called coupler nuts. As shown in Fig. 
7.31, the coupler nuts are integral with the coupler. 
The outer and inner diameters of the coupler nut 
are D and d respectively and the length is denoted 
by l. It acts as a hollow rod. Considering tension,

When the nut is initially tightened, the bolt is 
subjected to an initial tension, which is called the 
pre-load (Pi). Under the action of pre-load, the bolt 
is elongated by an amount (db) and the two parts 
are compressed by an amount (dc); thus

while the line CA shows the compression of the 
parts. The slope of the line CA is negative because 
of the compressive force.

Fig. 7.34 Force-deformation Diagram of Bolted Joint
When the parts are clamped and put into service, 
they are subjected to an external force P. The 
effects of the external force are as follows:
 
(i) The bolt is further elongated by an amount 
(Dd) and, consequently, the bolt load is 
further increased by an amount (DP). This 
deformation is indicated by the line AB.
 (ii) The compression of the two parts is 
relieved by the same amount (Dd) and 
there is a corresponding reduction in load. 
The reduction in load is (P – DP). This 
deformation is shown by the line AD.

further continue on line OB. The limiting point is 
M, where the compression of the two parts becomes 
zero. At this point, the joint will begin to open,

cases, the resultant load on the bolt is taken as the 
external load only.
Example 7.16 Two circular plates with (2d) and 
(d) as outer and inner diameters respectively, are 
clamped together by means of a bolt as shown in 
Fig. 7.35. The bolt is made of plain carbon steel 
45C8 (Syt = 380 N/mm2 and E = 207000 N/mm2), 
while the plates are made of aluminium (E = 71000 
N/mm2). The initial pre-load in the bolt is 5 kN 
and the external force acting on the bolted joint is
10 kN. Determine the size of the bolt, if the factor 
of safety is 2.5.

Solution
Given Pi = 5 kN P = 10 kN (fs) = 2.5

A bolted assembly of two 
components is shown in Fig 7.36. Initially, the nut 
is tightened by means of a spanner so as to induce 
a pre-load of 2.5 kN in the bolt. The external force 
P acting on the assembly is 5 kN. The bolt with 
coarse threads is made of plain carbon steel 30C8

7.18 BOLTED JOINT UNDER  
 
 
FLUCTUATING LOAD
In many applications, the external force acting on 
the bolted joint ﬂ uctuates between two limits. The 
endurance limit is the criterion of failure in these 
applications. The endurance limit of the bolt is 
determined by the procedure discussed in Chapter 
5. This involves the use of the surface ﬁ nish 
factor, the size factor, the reliability factor and the 
modifying factor to account for stress concentration. 
The fatigue stress concentration factors (Kf) for the 
threaded parts are given in Table 7.6. According 
to SAE and metric speciﬁ cations, bolt grades are 
numbered as per tensile strength. Higher the tensile 
strength, more is the grade number. Cutting is the 
simplest method of making threads. However, rolled 
threads have smoother thread ﬁ nish than cut threads. 
Rolling also provides an unbroken ﬂ ow of material 
grain in the thread region. Therefore, rolled threads 
are preferred for applications subjected to ﬂ uctuating 
loads. After determining the endurance strength, 
Goodman diagram is constructed. The following 
points should be noted in ﬁ nding endurance limit of 
threaded fasteners:
 
(i) It is not necessary to consider surface ﬁ nish 
factor separately. It is incorporated in fatigue 
stress concentration factor.
 (ii) The size factor is taken as 1 for axial 
loading.
 (iii) The reliability is assumed as 90% for ﬁ nding 
reliability factor.
A typical analysis of bolt failures indicate that
 
(i) 15% failures of bolt occur at the ﬁ llet under 
the head
 (ii) 20% failures of bolt occur at the end of 
threads on the shank
 (iii) 65% failures of bolt occur in the threads that 
are in contact with the nut

Connecting rod bolts are tightened with initial 
tension greater than external load due to the 
following reasons:
 
(i) When the connecting rod bolts are tightened 
up with initial pre-load greater than external 
load, the term (Pi) is much more than the 
260 Design of Machine Elements
term [1/22)P]. The ﬂ uctuating term [(1/22)P] 
is small and neglected. The total load on the 
bolt will be almost static and the bolt can be 
designed on the basis of static failure. 
 (ii) If the initial pre-load is not high enough, 
the term [(1/22)P] is comparable with the 
term (Pi). The resultant load on the bolt will 
be affected by the external load, which is 
ﬂ uctuating and it is required to design the 
bolt on the basis of endurance limit to avoid 
fatigue failure. 
It is desirable to design the bolts on the basis of 
static strength rather than on the basis of endurance 
limit. 
Therefore, in automotive applications, the 
connecting rod bolts are tightened with very high 
pre-load with the stress approaching the yield point.
Example 7.18 The assembly of two circular 
plates clamped together by means of a bolt, which 
is shown in Fig. 7.35, is subjected to a variable 
force P varying from 0 to 10 kN. The bolt is made 
of plain carbon steel 45C8 (Sut = 630 N/mm2; Syt 
= 380 N/mm2 and E = 207000 N/mm2). The two 
circular plates are made of aluminium (E = 71000 
N/mm2). The fatigue stress concentration factor is 
2.2 and the expected reliability is 90%. The initial 
pre-load in the bolt is 5 kN. Determine the size of 
the bolt if the factor of safety is 2.
Solution
Given Pi = 5 kN P = 0 to 10 kN (fs) = 2
For bolts, Sut = 630 N/mm2 Syt = 380 N/mm2 
E = 207000 N/mm2 Kf = 2.2 R = 90%
For plates, E = 71000 N/mm2

From Table 7.2, a bolt with ﬁ ne threads
M10 ¥ 1.25 (A = 61.2 mm2) is suitable for this 
application.
Example 7.19 
A bolted assembly is subjected 
to an external force, which varies from 0 to 10 kN. 
The combined stiffness of the parts, held together 
by the bolt, is three times the stiffness of the bolt. 
The bolt is initially so tightened that at 50% 
overload condition, the parts held together by the 
bolt are just about to separate. The bolt is made 
of plain carbon steel 5OC4 (Sut = 660 N/mm2 and 
Syt = 460 N/mm2). The fatigue stress concentration 
factor is 2.2 and the expected reliability is 90%. 
The factor of safety is 2. Determine the size of the 
bolt with ﬁ ne threads.
Solution
Given P = 0 to 10 kN (fs) = 2
For bolts, Sut = 660 N/mm2 Syt = 460 N/mm2

Example 7.20 The following data is given for a 
four-stroke diesel engine; 
Engine speed = 2000 rpm
Length of stroke = 100 mm
Length of connecting rod = 200 mm
Mass of reciprocating parts = 5 kg
At the big end, the cap is fastened to the 
connecting rod by means of two bolts. It can be 
assumed that the bolts are subjected to inertia 
forces only. The bolts are initially so tightened that 
at 50% overspeed condition, the cap is just about to 
separate. The combined stiffness of the parts held 
together by the bolts is four times the stiffness of the 
bolt. The bolts are made of chromium–molybdenum 
steel (Sut = 600 N/mm2 and Syt = 450 N/mm2). The 
bolts have rolled threads and the fatigue stress 
concentration factor is 3.0. The expected reliability 
is 90%. Determine the size of the bolts using a 
factor of safety of 2.

Example 7.21 Bolts are used to hold the cover 
plate on a pressure vessel, which is subjected to 
an internal pressure varying from zero to 2 MPa. 
The area over which the pressure acts may be taken 
to correspond to a 400 mm diameter circle. The 
bolts are preloaded to the extent of 1.3 times the 
264 Design of Machine Elements
maximum force exerted by the ﬂ uid on the cover 
plate. The combined stiffness of the parts, held 
together by the bolt (including the copper gasket), 
is four times the stiffness of the bolt. The following 
data is given for the bolts:
Ultimate tensile strength = 900 N/mm2
Yield strength = 700 N/mm2
Endurance limit in bending = 300 N/mm2
Fatigue stress concentration factor = 2.2

Example 7.22 
Figure 7.43 shows the arrange-
ment of supporting a machine weighing 200 kg at 
a distance of 1 m from the nearest point of support. 
The operation of the machine creates a rotating 
unbalanced force of 2000 N in the plane of the 
ﬁ gure and at the position of the machine. The speed 
of rotation is 14 rpm. The weight of the channel is 
20 kg/m. Two bolts, denoted by 1 and 2, hold the 
channel to the main frame. The bolts are located at 
35 and 270 mm from the nearest point of support. 
The following data is given for the bolts:
Ultimate tensile strength = 960 MPa
Yield point strength = 850 MPa
Endurance limit in bending = 500 MPa 
Fatigue stress concentration factor = 3.0
Factor of safety = 2
The initial preload in each bolt is 55 kN. The ratio 
of stiffness of the parts held together by the bolts to 
the stiffness of the bolts is 3.
Assume Goodman line as the criterion of failure. 
Determine the size of the bolts.

= P1(270) + (0.1296) P1(35)
\ P1 = 14 788.95 N  and P2 = 1916.65 N
Case 2 When the rotating force is acting upward
Taking moment of forces about the point C,
196.2(500) + (1962 – 2000)(1000)
 
= P1(270) + P2(35)
196.2(500) + (1962 – 2000)(1000)
 
= P1(270) + (0.1296) P1(35)
\ P1 = 218.91 N  
and 
P2 = 28.37 N
Therefore, the force acting on the bolt 1 
is critical and it ﬂ uctuates from 218.91 to
14 788.95 N.

Example 7.23 
A copper reinforced asbestos 
gasket is used between the cover plate and the 
ﬂ anged end of a pressure vessel as shown in
Fig. 7.47. The pressure inside the vessel varies 
from 0 to 1 MPa during the operation. The gasket 
requires a seating pressure of 5 MPa to make the
Fig. 7.47
joint leakproof. The total number of bolts used is 
8. The ratio of stiffness of the parts held together 
by the bolts to the stiffness of the bolts is 4. The 
effective sealing area may be taken up to the mean 
radius of the gasket. The factor of safety is to be 2 
for the ﬂ uctuating load. The following data is given 
for the bolts:

Welded and
Riveted Joints
Chapter 8
8.1 WELDED JOINTS
Welding can be deﬁ ned as a process of joining 
metallic parts by heating to a suitable temperature 
with or without the application of pressure. Welding 
is an economical and efﬁ cient method for obtaining 
a permanent joint of metallic parts.
There are two distinct applications of welded 
joints—a welded joint can be used as a substitute 
for a riveted joint and a welded structure as an 
alternative method for casting or forging. Welded 
joints offer the following advantages compared 
with riveted joints:
 
(i) Riveted joints require additional cover 
plates, gusset plates, straps, clip angles and 
a large number of rivets, which increase the 
weight. Since there are no such additional 
parts, welded assembly results in lightweight 
construction. Welded steel structures are 
lighter than the corresponding iron castings 
by 50% and steel castings by 30%.
 (ii) Due to the elimination of these components, 
the cost of welded assembly is lower than 
that of riveted joints.
 (iii) The design of welded assemblies can 
be easily and economically modiﬁ ed to 
meet the changing product requirements. 
Alterations and additions can be easily made 
in the existing structure by welding.
 (iv) Welded assemblies are tight and leakproof as 
compared with riveted assemblies.
 (v) The production time is less for welded 
assemblies.
 (vi) When two parts are joined by the riveting 
method, holes are drilled in the parts to 
accommodate the rivets. The holes reduce 
the cross-sectional area of the members and 
result in stress concentration. There is no 
such problem in welded connections.
 (vii) A welded structure has smooth and pleasant 
appearance. The projection of rivet head 
adversely affects the appearance of the 
riveted structure.
 (viii) The strength of welded joint is high. Very 
often, the strength of the weld is more than 
the strength of the plates that are joined 
together.
 (ix) Machine components of certain shape, 
such as circular steel pipes, ﬁ nd difﬁ culty 
in riveting. However, they can be easily 
welded. 
Welded structures offer the following advantages 
over cast iron structures:
 
(i) Welded structures made of mild steel plates, 
angles and rods are lighter in weight than 
cast iron or cast steel structures.
 (ii) In welded structures, the metal is put 
exactly where it is required. Heavy plates 
Welded and Riveted Joints 273
can be used where strength is required and 
thin plates can be used at other places. The 
rules of uniform cross-section and minimum 
section thickness required for casting process 
are not necessary for a welded design. The 
designer has more freedom and ﬂ exibility in 
the design of welded assemblies.
 (iii) Welded assemblies are more easily machined 
than castings.
 (iv) The capital investment for a welding shop is 
considerably lower than that for a foundry 
shop. Here, the cost of pattern making and 
storing is eliminated which reduces the cost 
of welded structures.
Welded joints have the following disadvantages:
 
(i) As compared with cast iron structures, 
the capacity of  welded structure to damp 
vibrations is poor.
 (ii) Welding results in a thermal distortion of the 
parts, thereby inducing residual stresses. In 
many cases, stress-relieving heat treatment is 
required to relieve residual stresses. Riveted 
or cast structures do not require such stress-
relieving treatment.
 (iii) The quality and the strength of the welded 
joint depend upon the skill of the welder. 
It is difﬁ cult to control the quality when a 
number of welders are involved.
 (iv) The inspection of the welded joint is more 
specialised and costly compared with the 
inspection of riveted or cast structures.
Today, riveting has been superseded by welding 
in metal working industries, ship building industries 
and boiler manufacture, except for certain special 
cases. Welding has also become the chief method to 
make joints in steel structures in civil engineering.
8.2 
WELDING PROCESSES
Welding processes are broadly classiﬁ ed into the 
following two groups:
 
(i) Welding processes that use heat alone to join 
the two parts. 
 (ii) Welding processes that use a combination of 
heat and pressure to join the two parts. 
The welding process that uses heat alone is 
called the fusion welding process. In this method, 
the parts to be joined are held in position and 
molten metal is supplied to the joint. The molten 
metal can come either from the parts themselves 
called ‘parent’ metal or an external ﬁ ller metal is 
supplied to the joint. The joining surfaces of the 
two parts become plastic or even molten under 
the action of heat. When the joint solidiﬁ es, the 
two parts fuse into a single unit. Fusion welding is 
further classiﬁ ed into the following three groups:
 
(i) Thermit welding
 (ii) Gas welding
 (iii) Electric arc welding
(i) Thermit Welding In this method, a mould is 
prepared around the joint and thermit is placed in 
the reservoir of the mould. Thermit consists of a 
mixture of ﬁ nely divided iron oxide and aluminum. 
When thermit is ignited, there is chemical reaction, 
which converts iron oxide into molten steel. This 
molten steel ﬂ ows into the mould, melts the parts 
and forms the joint on solidifying. The advantage of 
thermit welding is that all parts of the weld section 
are molten at the same time and cool at a uniform 
rate. This minimises the residual stresses induced 
in the joint. Thermit welding is used to weld 
heavy sections such as rails in the ﬁ eld, where it is 
uneconomical to transport welding equipment. It is 
particularly suitable to join parts of large casting 
or forging that are complicated to make in one 
piece. Thermit welding is used to repair heavy steel 
parts such as heavy machinery frames, locomotive 
frames and ship structures, where it is not possible 
to relieve the stresses in the joints. Due to uniform 
rate of cooling, thermit welding is ideally suitable 
for these assemblies.
(ii) Gas Welding In the gas welding process, 
oxygen–hydrogen or oxygen–acetylene gas is 
burned in a torch to create a pointed ﬂ ame. This 
ﬂ ame is directed upon the surfaces to be joined. 
The intense heat of the ﬂ ame heats the adjoining 
parts of the joint to the fusion temperature and 
simultaneously melts the welding rod to supply the 
molten metal to the joint. A ﬂ ux is used to remove 
the slag. There is a basic difference between gas 
274 Design of Machine Elements
welding and electric arc welding. In gas welding, 
the rate of heating is slow compared with electric 
arc welding. Therefore, the operator has more 
control over both heating and cooling rates. Gas 
welding is preferred for joining thin parts due to 
low rate of heating. 
(iii) Electric arc Welding In this method, the 
heat required for the fusion is generated by an 
electric arc between the parts to be joined and an 
electrode. This electrode can be made of ﬁ ller 
metal and consumed as the welding progresses 
or the electrode can be of non-consumable type. 
Filler metal is separately fed to the joint in case 
of non-consumable electrodes. In some cases, the 
consumable electrode is coated with a ﬂ ux material 
that vaporizes to form a gaseous shield around the 
joint and prevents the molten metal from absorbing 
oxygen or nitrogen from the atmosphere. If not 
prevented, the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen 
adversely affects the mechanical properties of the 
weld. Electric arc welding is popular in machine 
building industries as well as for structural work 
because of the consistently high quality of welding.
Welding processes that use a combination of 
heat and pressure to join the two parts are classiﬁ ed 
into the following two groups:
 
(i) Forge welding
 (ii) Electric resistance welding
(i) Forge Welding In forge welding, the parts 
are heated to reach the plastic stage and the joint 
is prepared by impact force. The impact force is 
produced either by a hand hammer or a press. 
Wrought iron or low carbon steel can be forge welded. 
This process has limited use in present times. It is 
used in the fabrication of wrought iron pipes.
(ii) 
Electric 
Resistance 
Welding In 
electric 
resistance welding, the parts to be connected are 
clamped together and a high amperage electric 
current is passed from one part to another. 
Resistance of metallic parts to electric current 
creates heat. This heat is utilized for melting the 
adjoining parts. No ﬁ ller material is used in this 
process. There are two terms related to electric 
resistance welding, viz., spot welding and seam 
welding. When a lap joint is formed by applying 
pressure by two electrodes, one on each side of 
overlapped plates, a spot weld is produced. If two 
rollers are substituted for the point electrodes and 
the plates are pulled between the rollers, a ‘seam’ 
weld is produced. Electric resistance welding can 
be easily automated and is often used as a mass 
production technique. Therefore, it is commonly 
used in automobile industries.
8.3 
STRESS RELIEVING OF WELDED 
 
JOINTS
Welded joints are subjected to residual stresses due 
to non-uniform heating of the parts being joined. 
There is always a possibility that localised thermal 
stresses may result from uneven heating and 
cooling during fusion and subsequent cooling. This 
also results in distortion. The magnitude of residual 
stresses cannot be predicted with any degree of 
certainty. This is the major disadvantage of welded 
joints. The following two methods can reduce the 
residual stresses:
 
(i) Preheating of the weld area to retard cooling 
of the metal in the vicinity of the joint.
 (ii) Stress relieving of weld area by using proper 
heat treatment such as normalising and 
annealing in temperature range of 550° to 
675°.
One of the methods of stress relieving is hand 
peening. It consists of hammering the weld along 
the length with the peen of the hammer while the 
joint is hot. It reduces residual stresses and induces 
residual compressive stresses on the surfaces. This 
improves the fatigue strength of the joint.
8.4 
BUTT JOINTS
Welded joints are divided into two groups—butt 
joints and ﬁ llet joints. A butt joint can be deﬁ ned as 
a joint between two components lying approximately 
in the same plane. A butt joint connects the ends of 
the two plates. The types of butt joints are illustrated 
in Fig. 8.1. The selection of the types of butt joints 
depends upon the plate thickness and the reliability. 
Some guidelines are as follows:
Welded and Riveted Joints 275
 
(i) When the thickness of the plates is less than 
5 mm, it is not necessary to bevel the edges 
of the plates. There is no preparation of the 
edges of the plates before welding. The 
edges are square with respect to the plates. 
Therefore, the joint is called square butt 
joint. It is illustrated in Fig. 8.1(a).
 (ii) When the thickness of the plates is between 
5 to 25 mm, the edges are beveled before the 
welding operation. The edges of two plates 
form a V shape. Therefore, the joint is called 
V-joint or single welded V-joint. This joint is 
welded only from one side. It is illustrated in 
Fig. 8.1(b).
Fig. 8.1 Types of Butt Joint
 (iii) When the thickness of the plates is more 
than 20 mm, the edges of the two plates are 
machined to form a U shape. The joint is 
welded only from one side. It is called single 
welded U-joint. It is shown in Fig. 8.1(c).
 (iv) When the thickness of the plates is more 
than 30 mm, a double welded V-joint is 
used. The joint is welded from both sides of 
the plate. It is shown in Fig. 8.1(d).
When the welding is to be done only from one 
side, a single welded V-joint with a backing strip 
is used to avoid the leakage of the molten metal on 
the other side. There are two types of the backing 
strip—permanent steel backing and removable 
copper backing. This type of joint is shown in
Fig. 8.1(e).
In applications like pressure vessels, the 
reliability of the joint is an important consideration. 
Single welded V-joint is more reliable than square 
butt joint. Single welded V-joint with backing strip 
is more reliable than single welded V-joint without 
backing strip. Double welded V-joint is more 
reliable than single welded V-joint with backing 
strip. The cost also increases with the reliability of 
the joint.
8.5 
FILLET JOINTS
A ﬁ llet joint, also called a lap joint, is a joint 
between two overlapping plates or components. A 
ﬁ llet weld consists of an approximately triangular 
cross-section joining two surfaces at right angles 
to each other. There are two types of ﬁ llet joints—
transverse and parallel, as shown in Fig. 8.2. A ﬁ llet 
weld is called transverse, if the direction of the 
weld is perpendicular to the direction of the force 
acting on the joint. It is shown in Fig. 8.2(a) and 
(b). A single transverse ﬁ llet joint is not preferred 
because the edge of the plate, which is not welded, 
can warp out of shape. In Fig. 8.2(a), the edge 
of the lower plate is free to deﬂ ect. Therefore, 
a double transverse ﬁ llet weld, as shown in Fig. 
8.2(b), is preferred. A ﬁ llet weld is called parallel 
or longitudinal, if the direction of weld is parallel 
to the direction of the force acting on the joint. It is 
shown in Fig. 8.2(c).
276 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 8.2 Types of Fillet Joints
There are two types of cross-sections for ﬁ llet 
weld—normal and convex, as shown in Fig. 8.3. 
The normal weld consists of an isosceles triangle—a 
triangle having two equal sides. It is shown in Fig. 
8.3(a). A convex weld is shown in Fig. 8.3(b). A 
convex weld requires more ﬁ ller material and more 
labour. There is more stress concentration in a convex 
weld compared to a triangular weld. Therefore, 
normal weld is preferred over convex weld.
Fig. 8.3 Cross-section of Fillet Weld
In addition to butt and ﬁ llet joints, there are 
some other types of welded joints, which are 
shown in Fig. 8.4. A tee-joint is a joint between 
two components located at right angles to each 
other in the form of a T. In this case, the end face 
of one component is welded to the side of the other 
component by means of a ﬁ llet weld as shown in 
Fig. 8.4(a). A corner joint is a joint between two 
components, which are at right angles to each 
other in the form of an angle. The adjacent edges 
are joined by means of a ﬁ llet weld as shown in
Fig. 8.4(b). An edge joint is a joint between the 
edges of two or more parallel components as shown 
in Fig. 8.4(c). It is used for thin plates subjected to 
light loads.

STRENGTH OF BUTT WELDS 
A butt welded joint, subjected to tensile force P, is 
shown in Fig. 8.5. The average tensile stress in the 
weld is given by,
 
st
P
hl
=
 
(8.1)
where,
 st  = tensile stress in the weld (N/mm2)
 
P  = tensile force on the plates (N)
 
h = throat of the butt weld (mm)
 
l = length of the weld (mm)
Fig. 8.5 Butt Weld in Tension
The throat of the weld does not include the bulge 
or reinforcement. The reinforcement is provided 
to compensate for ﬂ aws in the weld. Equating the 
Welded and Riveted Joints 277
throat of the weld h to the plate thickness t in Eq. 
(8.1), the strength equation of butt joint can be 
written as,
 
P = st tl 
(8.2)
where,
 
P = tensile force on plates (N)
 
st = permissible tensile stress for the weld
 
  (N/mm2)
 
t = thickness of the plate (mm) 
There are certain codes, like code for unﬁ red 
pressure vessels, which suggest reduction in 
strength of a butt welded joint by a factor called 
efﬁ ciency of the joint. Where the strength is to be 
reduced, Eq. (8.2) is modiﬁ ed and rewritten in the 
following way,
 
P = st tlh 
(8.3)
where,
 
h = efﬁ ciency of the welded joint (in   
 
  fraction)
Butt welded joint, when properly made, has 
equal or better strength than the plates and there 
is no need for determining the stresses in the weld 
or the size and the length of the weld. All that is 
required is to match the strength of the weld 
material to the strength of the plates.
Example 8.1 A gas tank consists of a cylindrical 
shell of 2.5 m inner diameter. It is enclosed by 
hemispherical shells by means of butt welded 
joint as shown in Fig. 8.6. The thickness of the 
cylindrical shell as well as the hemispherical 
cover is 12 mm. Determine the allowable internal 
pressure to which the tank may be subjected, if the 
permissible tensile stress in the weld is 85 N/mm2.
Assume efﬁ ciency of the welded joint as 0.85.
Fig. 8.6 
Solution
Given For shell, D = 2.5 m t = 12 mm 
For weld, st = 85 N/mm2  h = 0.85 
Step I Tensile force on plates
The length of the welded joint is equal to the 
circumference of the cylindrical shell.
l = p D = p (2.5 ¥ 103) = 7853.98 mm
From Eq. (8.3),
P = st tlh = (85) (12) (7853.98) (0.85)

STRENGTH OF PARALLEL FILLET
 
WELDS
A parallel ﬁ llet weld subjected to a tensile force P is 
shown in Fig. 8.7(a). The enlarged view of the ﬁ llet 
weld is shown in 8.7(c). There are two terms related 
to the dimensions of the ﬁ llet weld, viz., leg h and 
throat t. The size of the weld is speciﬁ ed by the leg 
length. As explained in Section 8.3, the cross-section 
of the ﬁ llet weld consists of a right-angled triangle 
having two equal sides. The length of each of the 
two equal sides is called a leg. As a rule, the leg 
length h is equal to the plate thickness. The throat 
is the minimum cross-section of the weld located at 
45° to the leg dimension. Therefore,
 
 t = h cos (45°)
or
 
t = 0.707 h 
(8.4)
Failure of the ﬁ llet weld occurs due to shear 
along the minimum cross-section at the throat. It 
will be proved at a later stage in Section 8.7 that 
for parallel ﬁ llet weld, the inclination of the plane 
where maximum shear stress is induced, is 45° to 
the leg dimension. The shear failure of the weld is 
shown in Fig. 8.7(b). The cross-sectional area at the 
throat is (tl) or (0.707 hl). The shear stress in the 
ﬁ llet weld is given by,
 
t =
P
hl
0 707
.
 
(8.5)
278 Design of Machine Elements
Rearranging the terms of Eq. (8.5), the strength 
equation of the parallel ﬁ llet weld is written in the 
following form:
 
P = 0.707 hlt   
(8.6)
where,
 
P = tensile force on plates (N)
 
h = leg of the weld (mm)
 
l = length of the weld (mm)
 
t = permissible shear stress for the weld
 
  (N/mm2)
Usually, there are two welds of equal length on 
two sides of the vertical plate. In that case,
 
P = 2 (0.707 hlt)
or
 
P = 1.414 hlt   
(8.7)
In determining the required length of the weld, 
15 mm should be added to the length of each 
weld calculated by Eqs (8.6) and (8.7) to allow 
for starting and stopping of the weld run. In case 
of a static load, the permissible shear stress for the 
ﬁ llet welds is taken as 94 N/mm2 as per the code of 
American Welding Society (AWS).
8.8 
STRENGTH OF TRANSVERSE
 
FILLET WELDS
A transverse ﬁ llet weld subjected to a tensile force 
P is shown in Fig. 8.8(a). The transverse ﬁ llet welds 
are subjected to tensile stress. The minimum cross-
section of the weld is at the throat. Therefore, the 
failure due to tensile stress will occur at the throat 
section. The cross-sectional area at the throat is
(tl). The tensile stress in the transverse ﬁ llet weld is 
given by,
 
st

Substituting Eq. (8.4) in the above equation,

(8.8)
Fig. 8.8 Failure of Fillet Weld
Rearranging the terms of Eq. (8.8), the strength 
equation of the transverse ﬁ llet weld is written in 
the following form,
 
P = 0.707 hlst   
(8.9)
where,
st = permissible tensile stress for the weld
 
(N/mm2)
Fig. 8.7 Parallel Fillet Weld in Shear
Welded and Riveted Joints 279
Usually, there are two welds of equal length on 
two sides of the plate as shown in Fig. 8.8(a). In 
such cases,
 
P = 2 (0.707 hlst)
or 
P = 1.414hlst   
(8.10)
The nature of stresses in the cross-section of 
the transverse ﬁ llet weld is complex. The weld is 
subjected to normal stress as well as shear stress. In 
addition, the throat is subjected to bending moment, 
which adds to the complications. Theoretically, it 
can be proved that for transverse ﬁ llet weld, the 
inclination of the plane, where maximum shear 
stress is induced, is 67.5° to the leg dimension as 
shown in Fig. 8.8(b). In order to simplify the design 
of ﬁ llet welds, many times shear failure is used as 
the failure criterion. It is assumed that the stress 
in the transverse ﬁ llet weld is shear stress on the 
throat area for any direction of applied load. With 
this assumption, Eqs (8.6) and (8.7) derived for 
parallel ﬁ llet welds are also used for the transverse 
ﬁ llet welds.
Example 8.2 A steel plate, 100 mm wide and 10 
mm thick, is welded to another steel plate by means 
of double parallel ﬁ llet welds as shown in Fig. 8.9. 
The plates are subjected to a static tensile force of 
50 kN. Determine the required length of the welds 
if the permissible shear stress in the weld is 94
N/mm2.

Adding 15 mm of length for starting and 
stopping of the weld run, the length of the weld is 
given by,
 
l = 37.62 + 15 = 52.62 or 55 mm 
Example 8.3 Two steel plates, 120 mm wide 
and 12.5 mm thick, are joined together by means 
of double transverse ﬁ llet welds as shown in
Fig. 8.10. The maximum tensile stress for the plates 
and the welding material should not exceed 110 
N/mm2. Find the required length of the weld, if the 
strength of weld is equal to the strength of the plates.

Solution
Given For plates w = 120 mm t = 12.5 mm
For welds h = 12.5 mm st = 110 N/mm2

The plates are subjected to tensile stress. The 
maximum tensile force acting on the plates is given 
by,

From Eq. (8.10), 
P = 1.414 h l st or 
165 000 = 1.414 (12.5) l (110)
\ l = 84.87 mm
Adding 15 mm for starting and stopping of the 
weld run, the required length of the weld is given 
by,
 
l = 84.87 + 15 = 99.87 or 100 mm
Example 8.4 A plate, 75 mm wide and 10 mm 
thick, is joined with another steel plate by means of 
single transverse and double parallel ﬁ llet welds, 
as shown in Fig. 8.11. The joint is subjected to a 
maximum tensile force of 55 kN. The permissible 
tensile and shear stresses in the weld material 
280 Design of Machine Elements
are 70 and 50 N/mm2 respectively. Determine the 
required length of each parallel ﬁ llet weld.

l = 25.29 mm
Adding 15 mm for starting and stopping of the 
weld run, the length of the weld is given by,
 
l = 25.29 + 15 = 40.29 or 45 mm
Example 8.5 A steel plate, 100 mm wide and 
10 mm thick, is joined with another steel plate by 
means of single transverse and double parallel 
ﬁ llet welds, as shown in Fig. 8.12. The strength of 
the welded joint should be equal to the strength of 
the plates to be joined. The permissible tensile and 
shear stresses for the weld material and the plates 
are 70 and 50 N/mm2 respectively. Find the length 
of each parallel ﬁ llet weld. Assume the tensile force 
acting on the plates as static.

Example 8.6 Two plates are joined together by 
means of single transverse and double parallel ﬁ llet 
welds as shown in Fig. 8.13. The size of the ﬁ llet 
weld is 5 mm and allowable shear load per mm of 
weld is 330 N. Find the length of each parallel ﬁ llet 
weld.

Solution
Given P = 150 kN h = 5 mm
Allowable shear load = 330 N/mm
Step I Total length of weld
It is mentioned earlier that the transverse ﬁ llet weld 
is designed on the basis of shear stress. In such 
cases, the stress in the ﬁ llet weld is considered 
as shear stress on the throat for any direction of 
applied load. With this assumption, the equations 
derived for the parallel ﬁ llet weld are also 
applicable to the transverse ﬁ llet weld.
Suppose L is the total length of welds required 
for the joint. Since the allowable shear load per mm

MAXIMUM SHEAR STRESS
 
IN PARALLEL FILLET WELD
A double parallel ﬁ llet weld of equal legs subjected 
to a force of (2P) is shown in Fig. 8.14(a). It is 
required to ﬁ nd out the inclination (q) of the plane 
in the weld, where maximum shear stress is induced 
and also, the magnitude of the maximum shear 
stress. The effect of bending is to be neglected. The 
free body diagram of forces acting on the vertical 
plate with two welds cut symmetrically is shown 
in Fig. 8.14(b). The symbol ¥ (cross) indicates a 
force perpendicular to the plane of paper, which 
goes away from the observer. The symbol ∑ (dot) 
indicates a force perpendicular to the plane of 
paper, which is towards the observer. The welds 
are cut at an angle q with the horizontal. t¢ is the 
width of plane that is inclined at angle q with the 
horizontal.

TRANSVERSE FILLET WELD
A double transverse ﬁ llet weld of equal legs is 
subjected to a force (2P) as shown in Fig. 8.15(a). 
It is required to ﬁ nd out the inclination (q) of the 
plane in the weld where the maximum shear stress 
is induced and also, the magnitude of the maximum 
shear stress. The effect of bending is to be neglected.

The free body diagram of forces acting on the 
vertical plate with two symmetrically cut welds is 
shown in Fig. 8.15(b). The shear force is Ps and the 
normal force is Pn.

8.11 AXIALLY LOADED
 
UNSYMMETRICAL WELDED JOINTS
In certain applications, unsymmetrical sections 
such as angle or T are welded to the steel plates or 
the beams. Figure 8.16(a) shows an angle section 
welded to a vertical beam by means of two parallel 
ﬁ llet welds 1 and 2. G is the centre of gravity of 
the angle section. The external force acting on 
the joint passes through G. Suppose P1 and P2 are 
the resisting forces set up in the welds 1 and 2 
respectively. From Eq. (8.6),
 
P1 = 0.707hl1t 
(a)
 
P2 = 0.707hl2t 
(b)
The free body diagram of forces acting on the angle 
section with two welds is shown in Fig. 8.16(b).
Since the sum of horizontal forces is equal to zero, 
 
P = P1 + P2    
  
 
(8.18)
Since the moment of forces about the centre of 
gravity is equal to zero, 
 
P1 y1 = P2 y2 
(d)
Substituting expressions (a) and (b) in the 
expression (d), 
 
l1 y1 = l2 y2 
(8.19)
Assuming total length of welds as l,
 
l1 + l2 = 1 
(8.20)
Equations (8.18) to (8.20) are used to ﬁ nd out 
the required lengths l1 and l2 of two welds.
Fig. 8.16 
Example 8.7 An ISA 200 ¥ 100 ¥ 10 angle is 
welded to a steel plate by means of ﬁ llet welds as 
shown in Fig. 8.17. The angle is subjected to a 
static force of 150 kN and the permissible shear 
stress for the weld is 70 N/mm2. Determine the 
lengths of weld at the top and bottom.
Solution
Given P = 150 kN t = 70 N/mm2 h = 10 mm
Fig. 8.17
Step I Total length of weld
The total length (l) of the weld required to withstand 
the load of 150 kN is given by [Eq. (8.6)].
P = 0.707 hlt or 150 ¥ 103 = 0.707 (10) l (70)
l = 303.09 mm

Step II Weld lengths l1 and l2
From Eq. (8.19),
 
l1y1 = l2y2 or l1(200 – 71.8) = l2 (71.8)
 
128.2 l1 = 71.8 l2 
(ii)
Also, 
 
l1 + l2 = l = 303.09 mm

From (ii) and (iii),
 
l1 = 108.81 mm  and l2 = 194.28 mm

Example 8.8 How much length of a 10 mm ﬁ llet 
weld is required to weld the long side of an ISA 
angle 150 ¥ 75 ¥ 10 to a steel plate with side welds 
only? A static load of 125 kN acts through the 
centre of gravity of the angle section which is 53.2 
mm from the short side. The allowable load per mm 
of the weld length is 665 N.
Solution
Given P = 125 kN
allowable load = 665 N per mm of weld

8.12 ECCENTRIC LOAD IN
 
THE PLANE OF WELDS 
The design of welded joint subjected to an 
eccentric load in the plane of welds, consists 
of calculations of primary and secondary shear 
stresses. A bracket subjected to an eccentric force 
P and attached to the support by means of two 
ﬁ llet welds W1 and W2 is shown in Fig. 8.19(a). 
In such problems, the ﬁ rst step is to determine 
the centre of gravity of welds, treating the weld 
as a line. Suppose G is the centre of gravity of 
two welds and e is the eccentricity between the 
centre of gravity and the line of action of force P. 
According to the principle of Applied Mechanics, 
the eccentric force P can be replaced by an equal 
and similarly directed force (P) acting through 
the centre of gravity G, along with a couple (M 
= P ¥ e) lying in the same plane [Fig. 8.19(b)]. 
The effects of the force P and the couple M are 
treated separately as shown in Fig 8.19(c) and (d) 
respectively.
Fig. 8.19 Analysis of Eccentrically Loaded Welded Joint
286 Design of Machine Elements
The stresses in this welded joint are shown in 
Fig. 8.20. The force P acting through the centre 
of gravity causes direct shear stress in the welds
[Fig. 8.20(a)]. It is called the primary shear stress. It 
is assumed that the primary shear stress is uniformly 
distributed over the throat area of all welds. Therefore, 
 
 
t1 = P
A  
(8.21)
where A is the throat area of all welds. 
Fig. 8.20 Primary and Secondary Shear Stresses
The couple M causes torsional shear stresses in 
the throat area of welds [Fig. 8.20(b)]. They are 
called secondary shear stresses and given by 
 
 
t2 = Mr
J  
(8.22)
where 
r = distance of a point in the weld from G 
J = polar moment of inertia of all welds about G 
The secondary shear stress at any point in the weld 
is proportional to its distance from the centre of 
gravity. Obviously, it is maximum at the farthest 
point such as A. The resultant shear stress at any 
point is obtained by vector addition of primary and 
secondary shear stresses [Fig. 8.20(c)].
Figure 8.21 shows a weld of length l and throat 
t. G1 is the centre of gravity of the weld, while G 
Fig. 8.21
is the centre of gravity of a group of welds. The 
moment of inertia of this weld about its centre of 
gravity G1 is given by,
 
Ixx = lt 3
12  and Iyy = tl 3
12
Since t is very small compared with l, Ixx is 
negligible compared with Iyy.
\  
JG1  = Ixx + Iyy @ Iyy
or  
JG1  = tl 3
12 = tl l(
)
2
12
 = Al 2
12
Therefore,
 
JG1  = Al 2
12  
(8.23)
where A is the throat area of the weld and JG1  is 
the polar moment of inertia of the weld about its 
centre of gravity. The polar moment of inertia 
about an axis passing through G is determined by 
the parallel axis theorem. Thus,
 
JG = JG1 + Ar1
2  
(8.24)
where r1 is the distance between G and G1. From

JG = A l

Where there are a number of welds, with polar

centre of gravity G, the resultant polar moment of 
inertia is given by,
 
J = J1 + J2 + J3 +  
(8.26)
The above value of J is to be used in Eq. (8.22) 
to determine secondary shear stresses.
Example 8.9 A welded connection, as shown in 
Fig. 8.22 is subjected to an eccentric force of 7.5 
kN. Determine the size of welds if the permissible 
shear stress for the weld is 100 N/mm2. Assume 
static conditions.

Solution
Given P = 60 kN t = 100 N/mm2
Step I Primary shear stress 
There are two horizontal welds W1 and W2 and one 
vertical weld W3. Refer to Fig. 8.26. By symmetry, 
the centre of gravity G of the three welds is midway 
between the two horizontal welds. Therefore,
y = 50 mm
Fig. 8.26
Taking moment about the vertical weld and 
treating the weld as a line, 
(50 + 100 + 50) x  = 50 ¥ 25 + 50 ¥ 25 + 100 ¥ 0 
 
x  = 12.5 mm
The areas of three welds are as follows:
 
A1 = (50 t) mm2
 
A2 = (50 t) mm2

8.13 WELDED JOINT SUBJECTED
 
TO BENDING MOMENT
A cantilever beam of rectangular cross-section is 
welded to a support by means of two ﬁ llet welds 
W1 and W2 as shown in Fig. 8.30. According to 
Fig. 8.30 Welded Joint Subjected to
 
Bending Moment
the principle of Applied Mechanics, the eccentric 
force P can be replaced by an equal and similarly 
directed force P acting through the plane of welds, 
along with a couple (Mb = P ¥ e) as shown in
Fig. 8.31. The force P through the plane of welds 
causes the primary shear stress t1, which is given by
 
 
t1 = P
A
 
(8.27)
where A is the throat area of all welds. The moment 
Mb causes bending stresses in the welds. The

8.15 STRENGTH OF WELDED JOINTS
The permissible stresses for welded joints in 
certain structures, such as unﬁ red pressure 
vessels, framework of buildings, ships or bridges, 
are covered by national or international codes. 
While designing such structures or their parts, it 
is obligatory on the part of the designer to use the 
values of permissible stresses given in the relevant 
standards. However, there are a number of welded 
machine components which do not come under the 
scope of these standards. Such components can be 
classiﬁ ed into two groups:
 
(i) where the strength of the weld is more than 
the strength of the parts joined together; and 
 (ii) where the strength of the weld is less than 
the strength of the connected parts. 
In the ﬁ rst category, the failure will occur in 
the parts joined together by the weld, while, in the 
second, it will occur in the weld deposit.
The strength of the weld deposit is more than the 
strength of the connected parts under the following 
conditions:
 
(i) The components are made of mild steel with 
less than 0.3% carbon.
 (ii) The welding electrodes contain 0.15% 
carbon.
 (iii) The electrodes are coated, resulting in 
shielded welding.
During the welding process, the coating on 
the electrode gives off an inert gas, which acts as 
a shield, protecting the arc from the surrounding 
atmosphere. The coating also forms a slag on the 
molten metal and protects it during the cooling 
process. The permissible stresses for welded joints 
under the above three conditions are given in Table 
8.1. The values given in the table are recommended 
by CH Jennings1. The failure of ﬁ llet welds is 
usually due to shear at the throat area of the weld. 
The permissible stresses for ﬁ llet weld, given in the 
table, are therefore permissible shear stresses for 
any direction of applied load.

When the components are made of materials, 
such as high carbon steel or alloy steel, the 
weld deposit is weaker than the strength of 
the connected components. In such cases, the 
properties of weld deposit, such as tensile strength 
 1 C H Jennings—‘Welding Design’—Trans. ASME—Vol. 58, page 497–1936.
296 Design of Machine Elements
or yield strength, are considered as a criterion for 
determining permissible stresses. The mechanical 
properties of weld deposits for the two varieties 
of electrodes are given in Table 8.2. The sufﬁ x 
E indicates solid extrusion of electrode. The 
electrodes are designated by a sufﬁ x letter 
followed by six digits in numerals and the details 
can be obtained from the standard2. Due to high 
degree of variation in workmanship and inspection, 
and because of the complexity of stress distribution 
and uncertainties in loading, a higher factor of 
safety of 3 to 4 is used in these cases.

8.16 WELDED JOINTS SUBJECTED
 
TO FLUCTUATING FORCES
When a welded joint is subjected to a static force, 
the effect of stress concentration is neglected. 
However, stress concentration is an important 
consideration while designing a welded joint 
subjected to ﬂ uctuating force. The stress ﬂ ow lines 
in the welded joints are shown in Fig. 8.40. There 
is sudden rise in the magnitude of stresses in the 
vicinity of welded joints. The values of the fatigue 
stress concentration factor (Kf) for different types 
of welds are given in Table 8.3. These factors are 
recommended by CH Jennings. The welded joints 
subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses are designed in 
accordance with the procedure outlined in Chapter 
5. This procedure is explained in the problem.

and subjected to a completely reversed axial load 
of ± 100 kN as shown in Fig. 8.41. The throat of the 
weld is 25 mm. The ultimate tensile strength of the 
weld metal is 450 N/mm2. The surface ﬁ nish of the 
weld is equivalent to that of the forged component 
and the reliability is 90%. Determine the length of 
the weld if the factor of safety is 2.

The complete information about the welded 
joint is conveyed by the designer to the welding 
operator by placing suitable welding symbols on 
the drawings. The information includes the type of 
welded joint, the size of weld, the location of weld 
and certain special instructions3. The basic symbols 
used to specify the type of weld are shown in
Fig. 8.42. The complete weld symbol consists of 
the following elements:
Fig. 8.42 Basic Weld Symbols
 
(i) a basic symbol to specify the type of weld;
 (ii) an arrow and a reference line to indicate the

weld, ﬁ nish, etc.; and
 (iv) dimensions of the weld in cross-section and 
length.
The weld symbols are illustrated in Fig. 8.43. 
The location of the weld is indicated by an arrow 
and a reference line. The head of the arrow 
indicates the reference side of the joint. When 
the weld symbol is below the reference line, the 
weld is made on the same side of the joint as the 
arrowhead. When the weld symbol is above the

reference line, the weld is made on the other side of 
the joint opposite the arrowhead. The dimensions 
given in the ﬁ llet weld indicate the leg dimensions. 
The length of the weld is indicated on the right 
hand side of the symbol. If nothing is speciﬁ ed, it 
means that the weld is continuous along the entire 
length of the joint.

8.18 WELD INSPECTION
The objective of weld inspection is to ascertain 
the satisfactoriness of the welding carried out 
for making a sound joint between the two parts. 
Welding inspection and testing differ from 
testing of engineering materials on account of the 
following two reasons:
 (i) It is not possible to cut the portion of the 
actual welded joint for mechanical testing. 
Tests are therefore carried out on ‘similar 
welds’ 
prepared 
specially 
for 
testing 
purposes.
 (ii) The quality of welded joint depends upon 
the skill and ability of the welding operator. 
Since the work is manual, variations in 
quality may occur. Therefore, two similar 
welds may not be exactly similar and this 
may result in misleading conclusions.
Weld inspections are broadly classiﬁ ed into two 
groups, namely, destructive and non-destructive 
examinations. 
Destructive 
examinations 
are 
carried out on ‘similar welds’ to assess certain 
characteristics like ultimate tensile strength or 
hardness of the welded joint. In this case, special 
specimens are prepared to carry out the tests. Non-
destructive testing is classiﬁ ed into the following 
categories:
 (i) Visual examination
 (ii) Radiographical examination by X-rays
 (iii) Radiographical examination by g-rays
 (iv) Magnetic crack detection method
 (v) Crack detection by ultrasonic vibrations
The objective of non-destructive examination 
is to detect the discontinuities in the actual welded 
structure, such as cracks, crater cavities, entrapped 
slag or ﬂ aws. Visual inspection is the simplest 
and cheapest method of weld inspection. The 
discontinuities, which are present on the surface of 
the weld, are detected by this method. However, 
the defects below the surface of the weld will 
remain undetected.
The X-ray method, which is recommended for 
class-1 pressure vessels, is expensive. The method 
consists of exposing the welded joint to X-ray 
radiation. When X-rays fall upon the metal, their 
passage is obstructed by the metal and a part of 
the radiation is absorbed. The amount of radiation 
absorbed depends upon the length of metallic 
path traversed by the rays. Where a void or crack 
is present, the amount of radiation absorbed in 
that region is less than that in the rest of the weld. 
This is revealed on a photographic ﬁ lm by a dark 
spot. The defects that can be detected by an X-ray 
examination are cracks, cavities due to imperfect 
fusion between the weld and the surrounding 
surfaces, gas pockets and cavities due to entrapped 
non-metallic matter like slag, ﬂ ux or oxide. The 
principle and procedure of other non-destructive 
examinations can be obtained from references.4 
8.19 RIVETED JOINTS
The joints used in mechanical assemblies are 
classiﬁ ed 
into 
two 
groups—permanent 
and 
separable. Permanent joints are those joints 
which cannot be disassembled without damaging 
the assembled parts. Riveted and welded joints 
are permanent joints. Separable joints are those 
joints which permit disassembly and reassembly 
without damaging the assembled parts. Bolted 
joints, cotter joints and splined connections are 
the examples of separable joints. In the past, 
riveted joints were widely used for making 
permanent joints in engineering applications like 
boilers, pressure vessels, reservoirs, ships, trusses, 
frames and cranes. During the last few decades, 
rapid development of welding technology has 
considerably reduced the sphere of applications 
of riveted joints. Today, riveted joints have almost 
been replaced by welded joints.
A rivet consists of a cylindrical shank with a 
head at one end as shown in Fig. 8.44(a). This 
head is formed on the shank by an upsetting 
process in a machine called an automatic header. 
The rivet is inserted in the holes of the parts being 
assembled as shown in Fig. 8.44(b) and the head is 
ﬁ rmly held against the back up bar. In the riveting 
 4 H B Cary – Modern Welding Technology – Prentice-Hall International, 1979.
Welded and Riveted Joints 299
process, the protruding end of the shank is upset by 
hammer blows to form the closing head. In rivet 
terminology, the closing head is called the point. 
The head, shank and point are three main parts of 
the rivet.
A rivet is speciﬁ ed by the shank diameter of 
the rivet, e.g., a 20 mm rivet means a rivet having
20 mm as the shank diameter. The standard sizes of 
rivets are 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 30, 33,36, 
39, 42 and 48 mm.
There are two methods of riveting—hand 
riveting and machine riveting. In hand riveting, a 
die is placed on the protruding end of the shank as 
shown in Fig. 8.44(c) and blows are applied by a 
hammer. In machine riveting, the die is a part of the 
hammer, which is operated by pneumatic, hydraulic 
or steam pressure. Riveting methods are also 
classiﬁ ed on the basis of temperature of the shank, 
viz., hot riveting and cold riveting. The difference 
between hot and cold riveting is as follows:
Fig. 8.44 Riveted Joint 
 
(i) In hot riveting, the end of the rivet shank 
is heated to about 1000° to 1100°C till it 
becomes bright red and then the blows are 
applied by a hammer. In cold riveting, there 
is no such heating.
 (ii) In hot riveting, when the rivet cools, the 
reduction in the length of the shank is 
prevented by the heads resting against 
the connected members. Therefore, the 
shank portion of the rivet is subjected to 
tensile stress while the connected parts are 
compressed. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.45. 
Fig. 8.45 (a) Tendency of Shank to Contract (b) Parts 
 
in Compression (c) Shank in Tension
 
 The compression of the connected parts 
causes friction, which resists sliding of one 
part with respect to another. Cold riveting 
does not hold the connecting elements 
together with as great a force as is developed 
in hot riveting. Therefore, hot riveting 
is recommended for ﬂ uid tight joints in 
pressure vessels.
 (iii) In hot riveting, the shank of the rivet is 
subjected to tensile stress. In cold riveting, 
the shank is mainly subjected to shear stress.
 (iv) Cold riveting is applicable for steel rivets 
up to 8 to 10 mm diameter and rivets made 
of non-ferrous metals like brass, copper and 
aluminium alloys. Hot riveting is carried 
out for steel rivets with diameters more than
10 mm.
In riveted structures, there are two methods to 
make holes in the plates—punching and drilling. 
The difference between these two methods is as 
follows:
 
(i) Punching is cheaper operation while drilling 
is costly.
 (ii) In punching process, the holes in different 
plates cannot be located with sufﬁ cient 
accuracy. Drilling results in more accurate 
location and size of the holes.
300 Design of Machine Elements
 (iii) Punching injures the metal in the vicinity 
of the hole. The drilling operation does not 
injure metal.
 (iv) Punching is feasible only for thin plates up 
to 25 mm thickness because ﬁ ne cracks are 
formed around the periphery of the holes in 
case of punching of the thick plates. Drilling 
operation is feasible for any thickness of the 
plates.
Sometimes, the punching operation is followed 
by a reaming operation. In critical joints, this 
combines the advantages of punching and drilling. 
Traditional mechanical structures involving riveted 
joints are classiﬁ ed into the following three groups:
 
(i) boilers, pressure vessels and tanks;
 (ii) bridges, trusses, cranes and machinery in 
general; and
 (iii) hulls of ships.
Fluid tightness is a desirable property of the 
joints in boilers, pressure vessels and ships. 
Strength and rigidity are desirable characteristics 
of joints in bridges, trusses and cranes. The joints 
in these applications are subjected to external 
load and strength is necessary to prevent failure 
of the joint. In application of a ship hull, strength, 
rigidity, durability and leakproofness are important 
criteria.
The scope of riveted joints in the above 
mentioned three groups of traditional applications 
is encroached upon by welded joints. However, 
riveted joint still remains the best and simplest 
type of permanent fastening in many applications. 
At present, riveted joints are mainly used in the 
following applications:
 
(i) In welding process, the parts are heated 
which deteriorate the metal structure and 
tamper the heat treated parts. It also results 
in warping of the components, which have 
been machined. Riveted joints are used 
where it is necessary to avoid the thermal 
after-effects of welding.
 (ii) Riveted joints are used for metals with poor 
weldability like aluminium alloys.
 (iii) When the joint is made of heterogeneous 
materials, such as the joint between steel 
plate and asbestos friction lining, riveted 
joints are preferred.
 (iv) Welded joints have poor resistance to 
vibrations and impact load. A riveted joint is 
ideally suitable in such situations.
 (v) Riveted joints are used where thin plates are 
to be assembled. They are popular especially 
for aircraft structures where light structures 
made of aluminium alloys are to be fastened.
A riveted joint has the following advantages 
over a welded joint:
 
(i) A riveted joint is more reliable than a welded 
joint in applications which are subjected to 
vibrations and impact forces.
 (ii) Welded joints are, in general, restricted to 
steel parts. Riveted joints can be used for 
non-ferrous metals like aluminium alloy, 
copper, brass or even non-metals like 
asbestos or plastics.
 (iii) The heat required for welding causes 
warping and affects the structure of heat 
treated components. The parts assembled 
by riveted joints are free from such thermal 
after-effects.
 (iv) The quality of riveted joint can be easily 
checked, while inspection methods for 
welded joint, such as radiographic inspection 
of pressure vessels, are costly and time 
consuming.
 (v) When the riveted joint is dismantled, the 
connected components are less damaged 
compared with those of welded joints.
The disadvantages of riveted joints compared 
with welded joints are as follows:
 
(i) The material cost of riveted joints is more 
than the corresponding material cost of 
welded joints due to high consumption of 
metal. There are two factors which account 
for more material consumption. The holes 
required for rivets weaken the working 
cross-section of the plate and it is necessary 
Welded and Riveted Joints 301
to increase the plate thickness to compensate 
for this loss. Therefore, the thickness of the 
plate or part is more in case of riveted joint 
compared with corresponding thickness of 
parts in case of welded joint. In addition, 
the weight of rivet is more than the weight 
of weld. It is estimated that rivets account 
for 3.5 to 4 per cent of the weight of the 
structure, while the weight of weld material 
comes only to 1 to 1.5 per cent. Increased 
material required for rivet and additional 
plate thickness increase the material cost of 
riveted joints. In addition, overlapping strap-
plates are required in some types of riveted 
joints.
 (ii) The labour cost of riveted joints is more 
than that of welded joints. Riveted joint 
requires higher labour input due to necessity 
to perform additional operations like layout 
and drilling or punching of holes. Besides, 
the process of riveting is much more 
complicated and less productive compared 
with welding operation. 
 (iii) The overall cost of riveted joint is more than 
that of welded joint due to increased metal 
consumption and higher labour input. On 
the other hand, welding is cheaper compared 
with riveting.
 (iv) Riveted assemblies have more weight 
than welded assemblies due to strap-plates 
and rivets. Welded assemblies result in 
lightweight construction.
 (v) Riveting process creates more noise than 
welding due to hammer blows. 
 (vi) Holes required to insert rivets cause 
stress concentration. However, in many 
applications, plates are made of ductile 
material like mild steel and the effect of 
stress concentration is reduced due to plastic 
ﬂ ow in the vicinity of the holes. Stress 
concentration also exists in the rivet at the 
junction between the shank and head. When 
riveted joint is subjected to variable external 
load, vibrations or temperature variation, 
fatigue failure may occur in the regions of 
stress concentration.
8.20 TYPES OF RIVET HEADS
There are number of shapes for the head of 
the rivet. The most popular type of rivet head 
is snap head as shown in Fig. 8.46(a). It is also 
called button head. Riveted joint with a snap 
head has strength and ﬂ uid tightness. It is used in 
boilers, pressure vessels and general engineering 
applications. Its main drawback is the protruding 
head, which is objectionable in some cases. Pan 
head rivet, illustrated in Fig. 8.46(b), consists of 
frustum of cone attached to the shank. It is also 
called cone head rivet. Pan head rivets are mainly 
used in boilers and ship hulls and are ideally suited 
for corrosive atmosphere. Its main drawback is the 
protruding head. In applications where protruding 
head is objectionable, countersunk head rivet as 
shown in Fig. 8.46(c), is employed. The riveted 
joints with snap and countersunk head rivets are 
illustrated in Fig. 8.47. Countersunk head rivets 
are used in structural work and ship hulls below 
the waterline. The countersunk hole weakens the 
plates or parts that are assembled to a great extent. 
Therefore, countersunk head rivets should be used 
under unavoidable circumstances. The ﬂ at head 
rivet is shown in Fig. 8.46(d). The height of the 
protruding head is less than that of snap head 
rivet or pan head rivet. It does not weaken the 
plate being assembled. They are used for general 
engineering applications. Flat head rivets of small 
sizes are called tinmen’s rivets, which are used 
in light sheet metal work such as manufacture of 
buckets, steel boxes and air conditioning ducts. A 
combination of countersunk head and snap head 
is shown in Fig. 8.46(e). It is also called half 
countersunk head. The height of the protruding 
head is less than that of snap head rivet. It is used 
for joining steel plates up to 4 mm thickness.
302 Design of Machine Elements

Sunk Head Rivet
Depending upon the application, there is slight 
variation in proportions of rivet heads. There are 
various standards which give dimensions of various 
types of rivets.5–10
The desirable properties of rivets are as follows:
 
(i) The rivet should be sound, free from cracks, 
ﬂ aws, burrs, seams, pits and other defects.
 (ii) The head of rivet should be concentric with 
the axis of the shank.
 (iii) The end of rivet should be square with 
respect to the axis. 
As shown in Fig. 8.48, the length of rivet shank 
is given by,
  
 
l = (t1 + t2) + a 
(8.33)
where,
  
l = length of rivet shank (mm)
  t1, t2 = thickness of plates (mm)
  
a = length of shank portion necessary to  
form the closing head (mm)
Depending upon the shape of the head, the 
magnitude of a varies from 0.7d to 1.3d. Or,

8.21 TYPES OF RIVETED JOINTS 
Riveted joints used for joining the plates are 
classiﬁ ed into two groups—lap joint and butt 
joint. Lap joint consists of two overlapping plates, 
which are held together by one or more rows of 
rivets as shown in Fig. 8.49. Depending upon the 
number of rows, the lap joints are further classiﬁ ed 
into 
single-riveted 
lap 
joint, 
double-riveted 
lap joint or triple riveted lap joint. In double 
or triple riveted lap joints, the rivets can be arranged 
in chain pattern or zig-zag pattern as shown in
Fig. 8.49(b) and (c) respectively. A chain riveted 
joint is a joint in which the rivets are arranged in 
such a way that rivets in different rows are located 
opposite to each other. A zig-zag riveted joint is a 
joint in which the rivets are arranged in such a way 
that every rivet in a row is located in the middle of 
the two rivets in the adjacent row.
Fig. 8.49
The following terms are used in the terminology 
of riveted joints:
(i) Pitch (p) The pitch of the rivet is deﬁ ned 
as the distance between the centre of one rivet to 
the centre of the adjacent rivet in the same row. 
Usually, 
 p = 3d
 where d is shank diameter of the rivet.
(ii)  Margin (m) The margin is the distance 
between the edge of the plate to the centreline of 
rivets in the nearest row. Usually,
 m = 1.5d
(iii) Transverse 
Pitch 
(pt) Transverse 
pitch, 
also called back pitch or row pitch, is the distance 
between two consecutive rows of rivets in the same 
plate. Usually,
 
 pt = 0.8p 
(for chain riveting) 
 
 
= 0.6p 
(for zig-zag riveting)
(iv) Diagonal Pitch (pd) Diagonal pitch is the 
distance between the centre of one rivet to the centre 
of the adjacent rivet located in the adjacent row.
The above terminology is illustrated in Fig. 8.49.
As shown in Fig. 8.50, lap joint is always 
subjected to bending moment Mb due to the 
eccentric force P. The line of action of the force P 
in two plates, that are joined by lap joint, have an 
eccentricity equal to (t/2 + t/2) or t. The bending 
moment is given by,
 
 
Mb = P ¥ t
This bending moment causes distortion of 
the plates as shown in Fig. 8.50(c). This is the 
drawback of lap joint.
304 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 8.50 Bending of Plates in Lap Joint
The construction of a butt joint is shown in
Fig. 8.51. It consists of two plates, which are kept in 
alignment against each other in the same plane and 
a strap or cover plate is placed over these plates and 
riveted to each plate. Placing the two plates, which
Fig. 8.51 Types of Single-riveted Butt Joint (a) Single- 
 
strap Butt Joint (b) Double-strap Butt Joint
are to be fastened, against each other is called 
butting. Depending upon the number of rows of 
rivets in each plate, the butt joints are classiﬁ ed 
as single-row butt joint and double-row butt joint. 
Depending upon the number of straps, the butt 
joints are also classiﬁ ed into single-strap butt joint 
and double-strap butt joint. The types of butt joints 
are illustrated in Fig. 8.51 and 8.52. The line of 
action of the force acting on two plates, joined by 
butt joint, lies in the same plane. Therefore, there is 
no bending moment on the joint and no warping of 
the plates. This is the main advantage of butt joint 
compared with lap joint. The disadvantage of butt 
joint is the requirement of additional strap plates, 
which increases cost. Therefore, butt joint is costly 
compared with lap joint.

A typical riveted joint used in construction work 
such as bridges, trusses and cranes is shown in
Fig. 8.53. It is known as diamond joint because the 
rivets are arranged in a diamond shape. It is also 
called Lozenge joint. This type of joint results in 
economical construction because a plate of smaller 
width is required for this joint. Lozenge joint is 
often called ‘economical’ joint.

8.22 RIVET MATERIALS
Rivets used in most of the applications are made 
of mild steel. There are two varieties of steel rivet 
bars—hot rolled steel rivet bar and high-tensile steel 
rivet bar. Their chemical composition is as follows:
  
carbon = 0.23% (max)
 
sulphur = 0.05% (max)
 
phosphorus = 0.05% (max)
Mechanical properties11-13 of steel rivet bars 
are given in Table 8.4. Rivets used in corrosive 
atmosphere are made of stainless steel. Rivets used 
for connecting non-ferrous metals and soft materials 
are made of copper, brass, bronze and aluminium 
alloys. Structural joints made of aluminium alloy 
sections employ duralumin rivets. When metal for 
the parts being joined and rivet metal have different 
electrochemical potentials, they form galvanic pairs 
and accelerate the corrosion process. Therefore, 
many times rivets are made of the same material as 
the parts being joined.

joint exceeds this force, failure occurs. Strength 
equations can be written for each type of failure. 
However, in analysis of riveted joints, mainly three 
types of failure are considered. They are as follows:
 
(i) shear failure of the rivet;
 (ii) tensile failure of the plate between rivets; 
and
 (iii) crushing failure of the plate.
Based on the above criteria of failure, the 
strength equations are derived.
(i) Shear Strength of Rivet The shear failure in 
the rivet of a single-riveted lap joint is illustrated in 
Fig. 8.55(a). In this case, the rivet is in single shear. 
The strength equation is written in the following 
way,

8.23 TYPES OF FAILURE
The types of failure in riveted joints are illustrated 
in Fig. 8.54. According to conventional theory, the 
failure of the riveted joint may occur in any one or 
more of the following ways: 
 
(i) shear failure of the rivet;
 (ii) tensile failure of the plate between two 
consecutive rivets;
 (iii) crushing failure of the plate;
 (iv) shear failure of the plate in the margin area; 
and
 (v) tearing of the plate in the margin area.
Based upon the above-mentioned criteria of 
failure, strength equations are written for riveted 
joints.
8.24 STRENGTH EQUATIONS
The strength of riveted joint is deﬁ ned as the 
force that the joint can withstand without causing 
failure. When the operating force acting on the

and so on.
In case of double-strap single-riveted butt joint, 
the rivets are subjected to double shear as shown 
in Fig. 8.55(b). The area that resists shear failure is 
twice the cross-sectional area of the rivet and Eq.

The tensile failure of the plate between two 
consecutive 
rivets 
in 
a 
row 
is 
illustrated 
in Fig. 8.56. The width of plate between 
the two points A and B is (p – d/2 – d/2) or 
(p – d) and the thickness is t. Therefore, tensile 
resistance of the plate between two rivets is given 
by,
 
 
Pt = (p – d) tst 
(8.37)
where,
 Pt = tensile resistance of plate per pitch
 
length (N)
 p = pitch of rivets (mm)
 t = thickness of plate (mm)

material (N/mm2)

(iii) Crushing Strength of Plate The crushing 
failure of the plate is illustrated in Fig. 8.57. This 
type of failure occurs when the compressive 
stress between the shank of the rivet and the plate 
exceeds the yield stress in compression. The failure 
results in elongating the rivet hole in the plate and 
loosening of the joint. The crushing resistance of 
the plate is given by,
 
 
Pc = dtsc n 
 
(8.38)
where,
Pc = crushing resistance of plate per pitch

sc = permissible compressive stress of plate  
 
material (N/mm2)

8.25 EFFICIENCY OF JOINT
The efﬁ ciency of the riveted joint is deﬁ ned as the 
ratio of the strength of riveted joint to the strength 
of unriveted solid plate. The strength of the riveted 
joint is the lowest value of Ps, Pt and Pc determined 
from Eqs (8.35) to (8.38). The strength of solid 
plate of width, equal to the pitch p and thickness t, 
subjected to tensile stress st is given by,

8.26 CAULKING AND FULLERING
In applications like pressure vessels and boilers, 
the riveted joint should be leakproof and ﬂ uid 
tight. Caulking and fullering processes are used to 
obtain such leakproof riveted joints. The caulking 
process is applied to the edges of plates in a lap 
joint and the edges of strap plate in a butt joint. 
These edges are ﬁ rst beveled to approximately 70° 
to 75° and the caulking tool is hammered on the 
edge as shown in Fig. 8.58(a). The caulking is done 
either by hand hammer or by the use of pneumatic 
or hydraulic hammer. The head of the rivet is also 
hammered down with the caulking tool. The blows 
308 Design of Machine Elements
of caulking tool closes the surface asperities and 
cracks on the contacting surfaces between two 
plates and also between the rivet and the plates, 
resulting in leakproof joint. Great care must be 
exercised to prevent injury to the plate, otherwise 
caulking will result in opening of the joint instead 
of closing it. Caulking cannot be applied to plates 
with less than 6 mm thickness.
Fig. 8.58 Caulking and Fullering
Fullering, as shown in Fig. 8.58(b), is similar 
to the caulking process except for the shape of the 
tool. The width of the fullering tool is equal to the 
thickness of the plate being hammered. The blows 
of the fullering tool result in simultaneous pressure 
on the entire edge of the plate.
Example 8.18 
A brake band attached to the 
hinge by means of a riveted joint is shown in
Fig. 8.59. Determine the size of the rivets needed 
for the load of 10 kN. Also, determine the width of 
the band. The permissible stresses for the band and 
rivets in tension, shear and compression are 80, 60 
and 120 N/mm2 respectively. Assume,

Step II Thickness of the plates
In case of tension in the plate, the ﬁ rst thought is 
to investigate the section-XX passing through the 
centres of the three holes as shown in Fig. 8.60. 
This section has minimum cross-sectional area. 
However, if the main plate is to break at this 
section, the two-hole section, denoted by YY, must 
also fail before the joint will break. This failure at 
the section-YY may be due to shear failure in two 
rivets or crushing failure in the plate at two holes. 
On the other hand, the plate might fail in tension 
at the two-hole section without affecting the three-
hole section. Therefore, strength equations are 
written for two-hole sections rather than three-hole 
sections. Or,
 
(w – 2d) tst = P

Two tie-bar plates of a bridge

respectively.

From (a) and (b), Ps < Pc
Therefore, shear strength of the rivet is the 
criterion of design. It is assumed that rivets are so 
arranged that there is only one rivet in the outer 
row. The tensile strength of the plate in the outer 
row is given by,
Pt = (w – d) tst = (250 – 27) (20) (80)

Equating the strength of the plate with the shear 
strength of n rivets,
 356 800 = n (64 412.47)
\ 
n = 5.54 or 6 rivets 
(ii)
Step III Arrangement of rivets 
The arrangement of six rivets in three rows is 
illustrated in Fig. 8.61. This type of arrangement 
in diamond shape is called Lozenge joint. The 
dimensions given in the ﬁ gure have the following 
numerical values,
 m = 1.5d = 1.5 (27) = 40.5 or 45 mm
 pt = 2d = 2 (27) = 54 or 55 mm
 t1 = 0.625 t = 0.625 (20) = 12.5 mm
From the ﬁ gure,
 m + p + p + m = 250 or 45 + 2p + 45 = 250
\ p = 80 mm
Step IV Efﬁ ciency of joint
In order to calculate the efﬁ ciency of the joint, we 
will proceed from the outer row of rivets to the 
inner row and ﬁ nd out the weakest cross-section of 
the joint. Let us consider the failure behaviour of 
three cross-sections denoted by AA, BB and CC.
 
(i) The joint can fracture along the section-AA 
without affecting the rivets in the middle and 
inner rows.
 (ii) The joint cannot fracture along the section-
BB without shearing one rivet in double 
shear. This is the rivet in the outer row.
 (iii) The joint cannot fracture along the section-
CC, without shearing three rivets in double 
shear. These are the rivets in outer and 
middle rows.
Based on these assumptions, the strength of the 
joint along three sections is calculated.
Along the section-AA,
strength = (w – d) tst = (250 – 27) (20) (80)
 
= 356 800 N 
(a)
Along the section-BB,
strength = (w – 2d) tst + 1 ¥ Ps
  
= (250 – 2 ¥ 27) (20) (80) + 64 412.47
  
= 378 012.47 N 
(b)

Along the section-CC,

+ 3 ¥ 64 412.47
 
= 463 637.41 N 
(c)
Shear resistance of all rivets = 6 ¥ Ps
 = 6 ¥ 64 412.47 = 386 474.8 N

8.27 LONGITUDINAL BUTT JOINT FOR
 
BOILER SHELL
There are two types of riveted joints in a cylindrical 
boiler shell. They are called longitudinal butt joint 
and circumferential lap joint. The plate of the boiler 
shell is bent to form the ring and the two edges of 
the plate are joined by a longitudinal butt joint. This 
longitudinal joint is usually a double-strap triple-
riveted butt joint. The longitudinal joint makes a 
ring from the steel plate. The circumferential joint 
is used to get the required length of the boiler shell 
by connecting one ring to another. For this purpose, 
one ring is kept overlapping over the adjacent ring 
and the two rings are joined by a circumferential 
lap joint. 
Boilers and pressure vessels are cylindrical 
vessels. They are subjected to circumferential and 
longitudinal tensile stresses. It can be proved that 
circumferential stress is twice the longitudinal 
stress. Therefore, the longitudinal joint should be 
stronger than the circumferential joint and butt joint 
is used for the longitudinal joint.
Boiler joints are subjected to steam pressure. 
They should withstand the steam pressure and 
also prevent leakage. Hence, great care must 
be exercised in their design and a high standard 
of workmanship should be provided in their 
manufacture. Further, the boiler shells are subjected 
to close inspection, which must conform to the 
Indian Boiler Regulation Act. Most steam boilers 
are designed, manufactured and afterwards tested 
according to this act. Indian Boiler Regulations 
are highly exacting and mandatory. There are two 
important points before we consider the design 
of riveted joints for boiler shells. At present, in a 
number of boiler applications, riveted joints are 
replaced by welded joints. Also, it is mandatory 
on the part of the designer to design the boiler 
joints strictly according to the Indian Boiler 
Regulations14. However, in this chapter, the design 
of boiler joint is based on fundamental equations to 
illustrate the theoretical principles. It is meant only 
for academic exercise. The following procedure is 
adopted for the design of a longitudinal butt joint 
for the boiler shell as illustrated in Fig. 8.62.
(i) Thickness of Boiler Shell The thickness of thin 
cylindrical shell subjected to internal pressure is 
given by,
 
 
t = PD
i
i
t
2s
 
(8.41)
where,
 
t = thickness of cylinder wall (mm)
 
Pi = internal pressure (N/mm2)
 
Di = inner diameter of the cylinder (mm)
 
st = permissible tensile stress for the
 
cylinder material (N/mm2)
The plate of the cylinder wall is to be drilled 
for the rivets. The weaker section passing through 
the rivet holes will not be as strong as the original 
solid plate. The ratio of strength of the joint to the 
strength of the original solid plate is expressed by the 
efﬁ ciency of the joint and denoted by h. Modifying 
Eq. (8.41) to account for this weakening effect,
 
 
t = PD
i
i
t
2s h  
(8.42)
where,
h = efﬁ ciency of the riveted joint (in fraction)
The wall of the boiler shell is subjected to 
thinning due to corrosion, which reduces the 
useful life of the shell. Provision has to be made 
by suitable increase in the wall thickness to 
compensate for the thinning due to corrosion.

312 Design of Machine Elements
Corrosion allowance (CA) is additional metal 
thickness over and above that required to withstand 
internal pressure. A minimum corrosion allowance 
of 1.5 to 2 mm thickness is recommended unless a 
protective lining is employed. Introducing corrosion 
allowance in Eq. (8.42),
 
 
t = PD

boiler joints are given in Table 8.5.

The factor of safety in boiler applications varies 
from 4.5 to 4.75. It is safe practice to assume the 
factor of safety as 5. There are two popular grades 
of steel used for boiler shells and boiler rivets. 
They are designated as Grade-St 37 BR and Grade-
St 42 BR. Their ultimate tensile strengths are as

(ii) Diameter of Rivet Indian Boiler Regulations 
do not specify any formula to calculate the rivet 
diameter. However, empirical relationships are 
suggested by design engineers. They are as follows:
 (a) When the thickness of plate is more than 
8 mm, the rivet diameter is calculated by 
following Unwin’s formula,
 15 IS 1990–1973: Speciﬁ cation for steel rivet and stay bars for boilers.
Welded and Riveted Joints 313
 
   
d = 6 t   
(8.45)
 where,
 
 d = diameter of the rivet (mm)
 
 t = thickness of the cylinder wall (mm)
 (b) When the thickness of the plate is less than 
8 mm, the diameter of rivet is obtained 
by equating shear resistance of rivets to 
crushing resistance.
 (c) In no case, should the diameter of the rivet 
be less than the plate thickness.
The diameter of the rivet hole is slightly more 
than the rivet diameter. The standard sizes of a 
boiler rivet and corresponding rivet holes are given 
in Table 8.6. Alternatively, the diameter of the rivet 
hole can be obtained by following approximate 
relationship:
 
d¢ = d + (1 to 2 mm) 
 
(8.46)
where,  d¢ = diameter of rivet hole 
(iii) Pitch of Rivet As shown in Fig. 8.62, the 
pitch of the rivets in the outer row is maximum.

The pitch of the rivets in the middle and inner rows 
is one half of the pitch in outer row, that is, (p/2). 
The pitch of the rivets in the outer row is obtained 
by equating the shear strength of the rivets to the 
tensile strength of the plate. For the purpose of 
analysis, let us consider the plate of length p with 
reference to Fig. 8.62. The tensile strength of the 
plate per pitch length in outer row of the rivets is 
given by,
 
 
Pt = (p – d) tst 
(a)
It is seen in Fig. 8.62, that inner and outer straps 
are of unequal width. The width of the inner strap 
is more than that of the outer strap. Therefore, the 
rivets in the outer row are subjected to single shear. 
At the same time, the rivets in middle and inner 
rows are subjected to double shear. Suppose,
n1 = number of rivets subjected to single shear  
 
per pitch length
n2 = number of rivets subjected to double shear  
 
per pitch length
When the straps have equal width, all rivets are 
subjected to double shear.

in single shear is given by,

follows:

more than one row of rivets and in which there is an 
equal number of rivets in each row, the minimum 
distance between the rows of rivets is given by,
(For zigzag riveting)
 
  
pt = 0.33p + 0.67d 
(8.50)
(For chain riveting)
 
  
pt = 2d 
(8.51)
Case II In joints in which the number of rivets in 
the outer row is one-half of the number of rivets in 
each of the inner rows and in which the inner rows 
are zigzag riveted, the minimum distance between 
the outer row the and next row is given by,
 
  
pt = 0.2p + 1.15d 
(8.52)
The minimum distance between the rows in 
which there are full number of rivets is given by,
 
 
 pt = 0.165p + 0.67d 
(8.53)
where p is the pitch of rivets in the outer row.
(v) Margin (m) The distance between the centre 
of the rivet hole from the edge of the plate is called 
margin. The minimum margin is given by,
  
 
m = 1.5d 
(8.54)
(vi) Thickness of Straps (t1) The thickness of 
straps for a riveted joint is calculated according 
to Clause 182 of Indian Boiler Regulations. The 
provisions of this clause are as follows:
Case I When the straps are of unequal width and 
in which every alternate rivet in the outer row is 
omitted,
  
t1 = 0.75t (for wide strap) 
(8.55)

N/mm2 respectively in all examples of this chapter.
Example 8.21 
A cylindrical pressure vessel with 
a 1.5 m inside diameter is subjected to internal 
steam pressure of 1.5 MPa. It is made from steel 
plate by triple-riveted double-strap longitudinal 
butt joint with equal straps. The pitch of the rivets 
in the outer row is twice of the pitch of the rivets in 
the inner rows. The rivets are arranged in a zigzag 
pattern. The efﬁ ciency of the riveted joint should be 
at least 80%. The permissible stresses for the plate 
and rivets in tension, shear and compression are 
80, 60 and 120 N/mm2 respectively. Assume that the 
rivet in double shear is 1.875 times stronger than in 
single shear. Design the joint and calculate:
 
(i) thickness of the plate;
 (ii) diameter of rivets;
 (iii) pitch of rivets;
 (iv) distance between the rows of rivets;
 (v) margin;
 (vi) thickness of the straps; and
 (vii) efﬁ ciency of the joint.
Draw a neat sketch of the riveted joint showing 
calculated values of dimensions.

h = 80% st = 80 N/mm2 t = 60 N/mm2
sc = 120 N/mm2

316 Design of Machine Elements
As shown in Fig. 8.63, the number of rivets per 
pitch length in various rows are as follows:
 (a) Outer row There is one half-rivet on the 
left side and one half-rivet on the right side. 
These make one rivet per pitch length. It 
connects the inner strap, the shell plate and 
the outer strap. This results in double shear 
in the rivet in the outer row.
 (b) Middle row There are two rivets per pitch 
length. They connect the inner strap, shell 
plate and outer strap. This results in double 
shear in the rivets in the middle row. 
 (c) Inner row There is one half-rivet on the left 
side, one complete rivet in the middle and 
one half-rivet on the right side. These make 
two rivets per pitch length. They connect the 
inner strap, shell plate and outer strap. This 
results in double shear in the rivets in the 
inner row. 
Therefore, there are ﬁ ve rivets per pitch length 
for a triple-riveted butt joint. Since the straps 
are of equal width, all rivets are in double shear. 
Therefore, 
 
 n1 = 0  
n2 = 5

Since, 
 p > pmax.
it is assumed that,
  
p = pmax. = 161.28 or 160 mm 
(iii)
The pitch of rivets in the outer row is 160 mm. 
The pitch of rivets in the middle and inner rows is 
(160/2) or 80 mm.
Step IV Distance between rows of rivets
The number of rivets in the outer row is one-half of 
the number of rivets in the middle and inner rows. 
Also, the rivets have a zig-zag pattern in middle 
and inner rows. From Eq. (8.52), the distance 
between the outer and middle rows is given by,
pt = 0.2p + 1.15d = 0.2 (160) + 1.15 (27)
 = 63.05 or 65 mm
From Eq. (8.53), the distance between middle 
and inner rows is given by,

Welded and Riveted Joints 317
Example 8.22 
A cylindrical steam pressure 
vessel of 1 m inside diameter is subjected to an 
internal pressure of 2.5 MPa. Design a double-
riveted, double-strap longitudinal butt joint for 
the vessel. The straps are of equal width. The pitch 
of the rivets in the outer row should be twice of 
the pitch of the rivets in the inner row. A zigzag 
pattern is used for rivets in inner and outer rows. 
The efﬁ ciency of the riveted joint should be at 
least 70%. The permissible tensile stress for the 
steel plate of the pressure vessel is 80 N/mm2. The 
permissible shear stress for the rivet material is 60 
N/mm2. Assume that the rivets in double shear are 
1.875 times stronger than in single shear and the 
joint do not fail by crushing. Calculate: 
 
(i) thickness of the plate;
 (ii) diameter of the rivets;
 (iii) pitch of the rivets;
 (iv) distance between inner and outer rows of the 
rivets;
 (v) margin;
 (vi) thickness of the straps; and
 (vii) efﬁ ciency of the joint.
Make a neat sketch of the joint showing all 
calculated values of dimensions.
Solution
Given For vessel, Di = 1 m Pi = 2.5 MPa
h = 70%  st = 80 N/mm2 t = 60 N/mm2

As shown in Fig. 8.64, the number of rivets per 
pitch length in two rows are as follows:
 (a) Outer row There is one half-rivet on the 
left side and one half-rivet on the right side. 
These make one rivet per pitch length.
Fig. 8.64 Double-riveted Double-strap Butt Joint with Equal Straps
318 Design of Machine Elements
 (b) Inner row There are two rivets per pitch 
length.
Adding these values, the total number of rivets 
per pitch length is 3. Since the straps are of equal 
width, all rivets connect the inner strap, the shell 
plate and the outer strap. This results in double 
shear in all the rivets. Therefore, 
 
 
n1 = 0  n2 = 3

The pitch of 150 mm is within the limits from

 p = 150 mm  
 
(iii)
The pitch of rivets in the outer row is 150 mm. 
The pitch of rivets in the inner row is (150/2) or

Step IV Distance between inner and outer rows
The number of rivets in the outer row is one-half 
of the number of rivets in the inner row. Also, 
the rivets are arranged in a zig-zag pattern. From
Eq. (8.52), the distance between inner and outer

8.28 CIRCUMFERENTIAL LAP JOINT 
 
FOR BOILER SHELL
The circumferential lap joint is used to connect 
different cylindrical rings together and form 
the boiler shell. In this case, one ring is kept 
overlapping over another ring and the two rings are 
fastened by circumferential riveted joint. This type 
of joint is also used to connect the end cover to the 
cylindrical shell. A single-riveted circumferential 
lap joint for a cylindrical shell is shown in Fig. 
8.65. The design of circumferential lap joint 
consists of the following steps: 
(i) Thickness of Cylindrical Shell The thickness 
of thin cylindrical shell is obtained by the same 
equation that is used for longitudinal butt joint. 
From Eq. (8.43),
 
 
t
PD
i

t
= 2s h  + CA
(ii) Diameter of Rivet The diameter of the rivet 
is obtained by the same procedure that is used for 
longitudinal butt joint. It is as follows:
Welded and Riveted Joints 319
 (a) When the thickness of the plate is more than 
8 mm, the rivet diameter is calculated by 
Unwin’s formula.
 
From Eq. (8.45),
 
 
d = 6 t
 (b) When the thickness of the plate is less than 
8 mm, the diameter of the rivet is obtained 
by equating shear resistance of rivets to 
crushing resistance.
 (c) In no case, should the diameter of the rivet 
be less than the plate thickness.
(iii) Number of Rivets As shown in Fig. 8.65, the 
rivets are subjected to single shear. The total shear 
resistance of all rivets in the joint is given by,

(iv) Pitch of Rivets The pitch of the rivets

plate per pitch length of rivets is given by,
 
 
Pt = (p1 – d) tst

The tensile strength of the solid plate per pitch

The guidelines for the values of efﬁ ciency are as 
follows: 
 (a) When there are number of circumferential 
joints in the shell, the efﬁ ciency of the 
intermediate circumferential seams is taken 
as 62%.
 (b) The efﬁ ciency of the end circumferential 
joint is assumed to be 50% of that of the 
longitudinal joint, but in no case less than 
42%. Therefore, 
For intermediate joints,
h1 = 0.62
320 Design of Machine Elements
For end joints
 
h1 = 0.5h or 0.42 (whichever is less)
Knowing efﬁ ciency of the joint and rivet 
diameter, the pitch of rivets is calculated by Eq. 
(8.59).

number of rivets in one row is given by,
 
 
n1 = p(

The number of rows is given by,
Number of rows =

number of rivets in one row
or
 
Number of rows = n
n1
 
(8.61)
After determining the number of rows, the type 
of joint such as single-riveted lap joint or double-
riveted lap joint is decided. The pitch is again 
readjusted. The pitch p1 obtained by the above 
procedure has minimum and maximum limits like 
the pitch of longitudinal joint. 
From Eqs (8.48) and (8.49),
 
 pmin. = 2d
 
 pmax. = Ct + 41.28
The minimum limit is set from considerations of 
manufacturing the rivet head, while maximum limit 
from considerations of obtaining leakproof joint.
(vi) Transverse Pitch Figure 8.66 shows a double-
riveted circumferential lap joint for a cylindrical 
pressure vessel. The transverse pitch (pt) is the 
Fig. 8.66 Double-riveted Circumferential Lap Joint
distance between two rows of rivets. The overlap of 
the plate, denoted by a, is given by,
  
 
a = pt + 2 m 
(8.62)
where,
 m = margin
The number of rivets in each row is equal. From 
Eqs. (8.50) and (8.51), (For zig-zag riveting)
  
 
pt = 0.33p + 0.67d
(For chain riveting)
  
 
pt = 2d
The margin m is given by,
 
 
m = 1.5d
Example 8.23 
A cylindrical pressure vessel with 
1 m inner diameter is subjected to internal steam 
pressure of 1.5 MPa. The permissible stresses 
for the cylinder plate and the rivets in tension, 
shear and compression are 80, 60 and 120 N/mm2 
respectively. The efﬁ ciency of longitudinal joint can 
be taken as 80% for the purpose of calculating the 
plate thickness. The efﬁ ciency of circumferential 
lap joint should be at least 62%. Design the 
circumferential lap joint and calculate:
 
(i) thickness of the plate;
 (ii) diameter of the rivets;
 (iii) number of rivets;
 (iv) pitch of rivets;
 (v) number of rows of rivets; and
 (vi) overlap of the plates.
Solution
Given For vessel, Di = 1 m Pi = 1.5 MPa
st = 80 N/mm2 t = 60 N/mm2 sc = 120 N/mm2
For longitudinal joint, h = 80 %
For circumferential joint, h1 = 62%

8.29 ECCENTRICALLY LOADED RIVETED  
 
JOINT
Many times, a group of rivets is employed in 
structural joints. When the line of action of external 
force does not pass through the center of gravity 
of these rivets, the joint is called an eccentrically 
loaded joint. The analysis of eccentrically loaded 
riveted joint is exactly identical to eccentrically 
loaded bolted joint in shear explained in Section 
7.11 of Chapter 7. The equations in that article are

Shafts, Keys and 
Couplings
Chapter 9
9.1 TRANSMISSION SHAFTS
The term ‘transmission shaft’ usually refers to 
a rotating machine element, circular in cross-
section, which supports transmission elements like 
gears, pulleys and sprockets and transmits power. 
A transmission shaft supporting a gear in a speed 
reducer is shown in Fig. 9.1. The shaft is always 
stepped with maximum diameter in the middle 
portion and minimum diameter at the two ends, 
where bearings are mounted. The steps on the shaft 
provide shoulders for positioning transmission 
elements like gears, pulleys and bearings. The 
rounded-off portion between two cross-sections of 
different diameters is called ﬁ llet. The ﬁ llet radius is 
provided to reduce the effect of stress-concentration 
due to abrupt change in the cross-section.
Fig. 9.1 Transmission Shaft
Shafts are given speciﬁ c names in typical 
applications, although all applications involve 
transmission of power, motion and torque. Some of 
the speciﬁ c categories of transmission shafts are as 
follows:
(i) Axle The term ‘axle’ is used for a shaft that 
supports rotating elements like wheels, hoisting 
drums or rope sheaves and which is ﬁ tted to the 
housing by means of bearings. In general, an axle 
is subjected to bending moment due to transverse 
loads like bearing reactions and does not transmit 
any useful torque, e.g., rear axle of a railway 
wagon. Occasionally, the axle also transmits torque, 
e.g., automobile rear axle. An axle may rotate with 
the wheel or simply support a rotating wheel.
(ii)  Spindle A spindle is a short rotating shaft. The 
term ‘spindle’ originates from the round tapering 
stick on a spinning wheel, on which the thread is 
twisted. Spindles are used in all machine tools such 
as the small drive shaft of a lathe or the spindle of a 
drilling machine.
(iii) Countershaft It is a secondary shaft, which 
is driven by the main shaft and from which the 
power is supplied to a machine component. Often, 
the countershaft is driven from the main shaft by 
means of a pair of spur or helical gears and thus 
rotates ‘counter’ to the direction of the main shaft. 
Countershafts are used in multi-stage gearboxes.
(iv) Jackshaft It is an auxiliary or intermediate 
shaft between two shafts that are used in 
transmission of power. Its function is same as that 
of the countershaft.
(v) Line shaft A line shaft consists of a number 
of shafts, which are connected in axial direction 
by means of couplings. Line shafts were popular 
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 331
in workshops using group drive. In group drive 
construction, a single electric motor drives the 
line shaft. A number of pulleys are mounted on the 
line shaft and power is transmitted to individual 
machines by different belts. Therefore, it is possible 
to drive a number of machines simultaneously by 
using a single electric motor. However, in recent 
times, individual drives have replaced group drive, 
making the line shaft obsolete.
Ordinary transmission shafts are made of 
medium carbon steels with a carbon content from 
0.15 to 0.40 per cent such as 30C8 or 40C8. These 
steels are commonly called machinery steels. Where 
greater strength is required, high carbon steels such 
as 45C8 or 50C8 or alloy steels are employed. 
Alloy steels include nickel, nickel–chromium and 
molybdenum steels. Common grades of alloy steels 
used for making transmission shafts are 16Mn5Cr4, 
40Cr4Mo2, 16Ni3Cr2, 35Ni5Cr2, 40Ni6Cr4Mo2 
and 40Ni10Cr3Mo6. Alloy steels are costly 
compared with plain carbon steels. However, alloy 
steels have higher strength, hardness and toughness. 
Also, high values of hardness and strength can 
be achieved for components with large section 
diameters. Alloy steels possess higher resistance 
to corrosion compared with plain carbon steels. 
Therefore, in some applications, these advantages 
justify the higher cost of the alloy steel. 
Commercial shafts are made of low carbon 
steels. They are produced by hot-rolling and 
ﬁ nished to size either by cold-drawing or by 
turning and grinding. Cold-drawing produces a 
stronger shaft than hot-rolling. However, cold-
drawn shafts have certain disadvantages. The 
tolerances on their diameters and straightness 
are not very close compared with shafts ﬁ nished 
by turning and grinding processes. Also, cold-
drawing produces residual stresses at and near the 
surface of the shaft. During machining operations 
like slotting and milling, required to make the key-
slot, the residual stresses are partially released 
causing distortion of the shaft. The straightening 
of distorted and twisted shaft is difﬁ cult and 
expensive operation. Therefore, most of the 
transmission shafts, after being hot-rolled, are 
turned and ground. They are further hardened by 
oil-quenching to achieve the required strength and 
hardness. Steel bars up to 200 mm in diameter are 
commercially available. For very large sizes, billets 
are forged into bars and ﬁ nished by usual turning 
and grinding operations. Commercial shafts, used 
for structural and general engineering purposes, 
are available in standard sizes.1 The standard 
diameters of these shafts are given in Table 9.1.

SHAFT DESIGN ON STRENGTH 
BASIS
Transmission shafts are subjected to axial tensile 
force, bending moment or torsional moment or 
their combinations. Most of the transmission shafts 
are subjected to combined bending and torsional 
moments. The design of transmission shaft consists 
of determining the correct shaft  diameter from 
strength and rigidity considerations. When the shaft 
is subjected to axial tensile force, the tensile stress 
is given by,

When the shaft is subjected to combination 
of loads, the principal stress and principal shear 
stress are obtained by constructing Mohr’s circle 
as shown in Fig. 9.2. The normal stress is denoted 
by sx while the shear stress, by t. We will consider 
two cases for calculating the value of sx.
Fig. 9.2 Mohr’s Circle
Case I In this case, the shaft is subjected to a 
combination of axial force, bending moment and 
torsional moment.
 
sx = st + sb 
(9.4)
Case II In this case, the shaft is subjected to a 
combination of bending and torsional moments 
without any axial force.
 
sx = sb 
(9.5)
The values of st and sb in Eqs (9.4) and (9.5) 
are obtained from Eqs (9.1) and (9.2) respectively. 
The Mohr’s circle is constructed by the 
following steps:
 
(i) Select the origin O.
 (ii) Plot the following points:
 
 OA = sx AB = t OD = t
 (iii) Join DB. The point of intersection of DB and 
OA is E.
 (iv)  Construct Mohr’s circle with E as centre and 
EB as radius.

Equations (9.1) to (9.7) are fundamental

time, it is not necessary to use all these equations. 
For the design of shafts, simple expressions can be 
developed by combining the above equations. The 
shaft can be designed on the basis of maximum 
principal stress theory or maximum shear stress 
theory. We will apply these theories to transmission 
shaft subjected to combined bending and torsional 
moments.

ductile materials, it is more logical to apply this 
theory to shaft design rather than designing the 
shaft on the basis of principal stress theory.
We will rewrite Eqs (9.10) and (9.8) again.

concept of equivalent bending moment is used 
in the design of shafts on the basis of maximum 
principal stress theory of failure. 
9.3 
SHAFT DESIGN ON TORSIONAL 
RIGIDITY BASIS
In some applications, the shafts are designed on the 
basis of either torsional rigidity or lateral rigidity. 
A transmission shaft is said to be rigid on the basis 
of torsional rigidity, if it does not twist too much 
under the action of an external torque. Similarly, the 
transmission shaft is said to be rigid on the basis of 
lateral rigidity, if it does not deﬂ ect too much under 
the action of external forces and bending moment.
In certain applications, like machine tool 
spindles, it is necessary to design the shaft on 
the basis of torsional rigidity, i.e., on the basis of 
permissible angle of twist per metre length of shaft. 
The angle of twist qr (in radians) is given by,

where,
 q  = angle of twist (deg.)
 l  = length of shaft subjected to twisting 
moment (mm)
 Mt = torsional moment (N-mm)
 G  = modulus of rigidity (N/mm2)
 d  = shaft diameter (mm)
Equation (9.13) is used to design the shaft on the 
basis of torsional rigidity. The permissible angle of 
twist for machine tool applications is 0.25° per 
metre length. For line shafts, 3° per metre length is 
the limiting value. Modulus of rigidity for steel is 
79 300 N/mm2 or approximately 80 kN/mm2.
9.4 ASME CODE FOR SHAFT DESIGN
One important approach of designing a transmission 
shaft is to use the ASME code. According to this 
code, the permissible shear stress tmax. for the shaft 
without keyways is taken as 30% of yield strength 
in tension or 18% of the ultimate tensile strength of 
the material, whichever is minimum. Therefore,
 tmax. = 0.30 Syt
or, 
tmax. = 0.18 Sut (whichever is minimum) (9.14)
If keyways are present, the above values are to 
be reduced by 25 per cent. According to the ASME 
code, the bending and torsional moments are to 
be multiplied by factors kb and kt respectively, 
to account for shock and fatigue in operating 
condition. The ASME code is based on maximum 
shear stress theory of failure. Therefore, Eq. (9.10) 
is modiﬁ ed and rewritten as,
 
tmax. = 16

Example 9.1 The layout of a transmission shaft 
carrying two pulleys B and C and supported on 
bearings A and D is shown in Fig. 9.3(a). Power 
is supplied to the shaft by means of a vertical belt 
on the pulley B, which is then transmitted to the 
pulley C carrying a horizontal belt. The maximum 
tension in the belt on the pulley B is 2.5 kN. The 
angle of wrap for both the pulleys is 180° and the 
coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.24. The shaft is made of 
plain carbon steel 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) and the 
factor of safety is 3. Determine the shaft diameter 
on strength basis.

DESIGN OF HOLLOW SHAFT ON 
STRENGTH BASIS
The torsional shear stress and bending stresses in 
the shaft are given by,
 
t = 
M r
J
t  sb = M y
I
b
The distribution of bending stresses and 
torsional shear stress is shown in Fig. 9.14. It is 
observed that the torsional shear stress as well as 
bending stresses are zero at the shaft centre (r = 
0 and y = 0) and negligibly small in the vicinity 
of the shaft centre, where the radius is small. As 
the radius increases, the resisting stresses due to 
external bending and torsional moments increase. 
Therefore, outer ﬁ bres are more effective in 
resisting the applied moments. In hollow shafts, 
the material at the centre is removed and spread at 
large radius. Therefore, hollow shafts are stronger 
than solid shafts having the same weight.
Fig. 9.14 (a) Distribution of Bending Stresses
(b) Distribution of Torsional Shear Stress
Compared with solid shaft, hollow shaft offers 
following advantages:
 
(i) The stiffness of the hollow shaft is more than 
that of solid shaft with same weight.
 (ii) The strength of hollow shaft is more than 
that of solid shaft with same weight.
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 343
 (iii) The natural frequency of  hollow shaft is higher 
than that of solid shaft with same weight.
Compared with solid shaft, hollow shaft has the 
following disadvantages:
 
(i) Hollow shaft is costlier than solid shaft.
 (ii) The diameter of hollow shaft is more than 
that of solid shaft and requires more space.
Hollow shafts are used to provide passage for 
coolants and control cables in case of deep hole 
drilling and borewell drilling. They are also used 
as propeller shafts in automobiles and for axles 
of railway wagons. Their applications include 
epicyclic gearboxes where one shaft rotates inside 
another. Hollow shafts are usually made by the 
extrusion process.
The design of hollow shaft consists of 
determining the correct inner and outer diameters 
from strength and rigidity considerations. Such 
shafts are subjected to axial tensile force, bending 
moment, torsional moment or combination of these 
loads. Let us assume,

Construction of Mohr’s circle diagram for 
hollow shaft is similar to Mohr’s circle for solid 
shaft. It is illustrated in Fig. 9.2. sx is the normal 
stress while t is the shear stress. We will consider 
two cases for calculating the values of sx.
Case I In this case, the shaft is subjected to a 
combination of axial force, bending moment and 
torsional moment.
 
sx = st + sb
Case II In this case, the shaft is subjected to a 
combination of bending and torsional moments, 
without any axial force.
 
sx = sb

DESIGN OF HOLLOW SHAFT ON

Example 9.10 A propeller shaft is required to 
transmit 45 kW power at 500 rpm. It is a hollow 
shaft, having an inside diameter 0.6 times of outside 
diameter. It is made of plain carbon steel and the 
permissible shear stress is 84 N/mm2. Calculate the

Example 9.11 A hollow transmission shaft, 
having inside diameter 0.6 times the outside 
diameter, is made of plain carbon steel 40C8 (Syt 
= 380 N/mm2) and the factor of safety is 3. A belt 
pulley, 1000 mm in diameter, is mounted on the 
shaft, which overhangs the left hand bearing by 
250 mm. The belts are vertical and transmit power 
to the machine shaft below the pulley. The tension 
on the tight and slack sides of the belt are 3 kN and 
1 kN respectively, while the weight of the pulley is 
500 N. The angle of wrap of the belt on the pulley

Example 9.12 A solid shaft of diameter d is 
used in power transmission. Due to modiﬁ cation 
of the existing transmission system, it is required to 
replace the solid shaft by a hollow shaft of the same 
material and equally strong in torsion. Further, the 
weight of the hollow shaft per metre length should 
be half of the solid shaft. Determine the outer

9.7 FLEXIBLE SHAFTS
Flexible shafts are used to transmit torque between 
machine units, which may change their relative 
positions during operation. Their main applications 
include portable power driven tools, speedometer 
drives, positioning devices, portable grinders, 
concrete vibrators, remote control devices and 
servo drives. In these applications, ﬂ exibility is 
required to accommodate large angular and offset 
misalignment between driving and driven units. 
Flexible shafts have two important properties:
 
(i) They have low rigidity in bending, making 
them ﬂ exible.
 (ii) They have high rigidity in torsion, making 
them capable to transmit torque.
A ﬂ exible shaft2 consists of an inner core, outer 
casing and end attachments. The inner core consists 
of a wire coil. In effect, it is a helical torsion spring 
with closely wound coils. The direction of rotation 
of the shaft should be such that when the torque is 
transmitted, the spring is further twisted. The casing 
protects the shaft from dirt, retains the lubricant 
such as grease on the shaft surface, prevents the 
formation of loops in operation, and protects the 
operator from injury. The end ﬁ ttings are intended 
to connect the ﬂ exible shaft to driving and driven 
members.
The applications of ﬂ exible shafts are restricted 
to low power drives.
9.8 KEYS
A key can be deﬁ ned as a machine element which 
is used to connect the transmission shaft to rotating 
machine elements like pulleys, gears, sprockets or 
ﬂ ywheels. A keyed joint consisting of shaft, hub and 
key is illustrated in  Fig. 9.16. There are two basic 
functions of the key. They are as follows:
 2 IS 4600–1968: Speciﬁ cation for ﬂ exible shafts.
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 347
 
(i) The primary function of the key is to 
transmit the torque from the shaft to the hub 
of the mating element and vice versa.
 (ii) The second function of the key is to prevent 
relative rotational motion between the shaft 
and the joined machine element like gear 
or pulley. In most of the cases, the key also 
prevents axial motion between two elements, 
except in case of feather key or splined 
connection.

Shaft

Hub
Fig. 9.16 Key-joint
A recess or slot machined either on the shaft 
or in the hub to accommodate the key is called 
keyway. The keyway is usually cut by a vertical 
or horizontal milling cutter. The keyway results 
in stress concentration in the shaft and the part 
becomes weak. This is the main drawback of a 
keyed joint. Keys are made of plain carbon steels 
like 45C8 or 50C8 in order to withstand shear and 
compressive stresses resulting from transmission 
of torque. According to Indian standards, steel of 
tensile strength not less than 600 N/mm2 shall be 
used as the material for the key.
Many types of keys are available and there are a 
number of standards, which specify the dimensions 
of the key3-6. There are different ways to classify 
the keys. Some of them are as follows:
 
(i) Saddle key and sunk key
 (ii) Square key and ﬂ at key
 (iii) Taper key and parallel key 
 (iv) Key with and without Gib-head
In addition, there are special types of keys such 
as Woodruff key, Kennedy key or feather key. The 
selection of the type of key for a given application 
depends upon the following factors: 
 
(i) power to be transmitted;
 (ii) tightness of ﬁ t;
 (iii) stability of connection; and 
 (iv) cost.
In this chapter, only popular types of key are 
discussed.
9.9 SADDLE KEYS
A saddle key is a key which ﬁ ts in the keyway of the 
hub only. In this case, there is no keyway on the 
shaft. There are two types of saddle keys, namely, 
hollow and ﬂ at, as shown in Fig. 9.17. A hollow 
saddle key has a concave surface at the bottom to 
match the circular surface of the shaft. A ﬂ at saddle 
(a)
(b)
Fig. 9.17 (a) Hollow Saddle Key (b) Flat Saddle Key
key has a ﬂ at surface at the bottom and it sits on 
the ﬂ at surface machined on the shaft. In both types 
of saddle keys, friction between the shaft, key and 
 3 IS 2048–1983: Speciﬁ cation for parallel keys and keyways.
 4 IS 2292–1974: Speciﬁ cation for taper keys and keyways.
 5 IS 2293–1974: Speciﬁ cation for Gib-head key and keyways.
 6 IS 2294–1980: Speciﬁ cation for Woodruff keys and keyways.
348 Design of Machine Elements
hub prevents relative motion between the shaft 
and the hub. The power is transmitted by means 
of friction. Therefore, saddle keys are suitable for 
light duty or low power transmission as compared 
with sunk keys. The resistance to slip in case of  
ﬂ at key is slightly more than that of  hollow key 
with concave surface. Therefore,  ﬂ at saddle key 
is slightly superior to  hollow saddle key as far as 
power transmitting capacity is concerned.
Saddle key requires keyway only on the hub. 
Therefore, cost of the saddle key joint is less than 
that of sunk key joint. This is the main advantage 
of the saddle key. The disadvantage of the saddle 
key is its low power transmitting capacity. Saddle 
key is liable to slip around the shaft when subjected 
to heavy torque. Therefore, it cannot be used in 
medium and heavy duty applications.
9.10 SUNK KEYS
A sunk key is a key in which half the thickness of 
the key ﬁ ts into the keyway on the shaft and the 
remaining half in the keyway on the hub. Therefore, 
keyways are required both on the shaft as well as 
the hub of the mating element. This is a standard 
form of key and may be either of rectangular or 
square cross-section as shown in Fig. 9.18. The 
standard dimensions of square and rectangular 
cross-section sunk keys are given in Table 9.3 given 
on page 349. In sunk key, power is transmitted due 
to shear resistance of the key. The relative motion 
between the shaft and the hub is also prevented by 
the shear resistance of key. Therefore, sunk key is 
suitable for heavy duty application, since there is 
no possibility of the key to slip around the shaft.

It is a positive drive. This is the main advantage 
of the sunk key over the saddle key. However, it 
is necessary to cut keyways both on the shaft and 
the hub. Therefore, the cost of the sunk key joint is 
more than that of the saddle key joint.
Sunk keys with square or rectangular cross-
sections are widely used in practice. A sunk key 
with rectangular cross-section is called a ﬂ at 
key. The ﬂ at key has more stability as compared 
with  square key. Square keys are used in general 
industrial machinery. Flat keys are more suitable 
for machine tool applications, where additional 
stability of the connection is desirable. While 
selecting the square key without stress analysis, 
the following rule of thumb may be used. “The 
industrial practice is to use a square key with sides 
equal to one-quarter of the shaft diameter and 
length at least 1.5 times the shaft diameter”.

Sunk keys with square or rectangular cross-
sections are classiﬁ ed into two groups, namely, 
parallel and taper keys. A parallel key is a sunk 
key which is uniform in width as well as height 
throughout the length of the key. A taper key 
is uniform in width but tapered in height. The 
standard taper is 1 in 100. The bottom surface of 
the key is straight and the top surface is given a 
taper. The taper is provided for the following two 
reasons:
 
(i) When the key is inserted in the keyways 
of shaft and the hub and pressed by means 
of  hammer, it becomes tight due to wedge 
action. This insures tightness of joint in 
operating conditions and prevents loosening 
of the parts.
 (ii) Due to taper, it is easy to remove the key and 
dismantle the joint.
The taper of the key is on one side. Machining 
taper on two sides of key is more difﬁ cult than 
making taper on one side. Also, there is no speciﬁ c 
advantage of taper on two sides. Tapered keys are 
often provided with Gib-head to facilitate removal. 
The Gib-head taper key is shown in Fig. 9.19. The 
projection of Gib-head is hazardous in rotating 
parts. As compared with parallel key, taper key has 
the following advantages: 
 
(i) The taper surface results in wedge action and 
increases frictional force and the tightness of 
the joint.
 (ii) The taper surface facilitates easy removal of 
the key, particularly with Gib-head.
Fig. 9.19 Gib-head Taper Key
However, machining taper on the surface 
increases the cost.
9.11 FEATHER KEY
A feather key is a parallel key which is ﬁ xed 
either to the shaft or to the hub and which permits 
350 Design of Machine Elements
relative axial movement between them. The feather 
key is a particular type of sunk key with uniform 
width and height. There are number of methods to 
ﬁ x the key to the shaft or hub. Figure 9.20 shows a 
feather key, which is ﬁ xed to the shaft by means of 
two cap screws, having countersunk-heads. There 
is a clearance ﬁ t between the key and the keyway 
in the hub. Therefore, the hub is free to slide over 
the key. At the same time, there is no relative 
rotational movement between the shaft and the 
hub. Therefore, the feather key transmits the torque 
and at the same time permits some axial movement 
of the hub. Feather keys are used where the parts 
mounted on the shaft are required to slide along the 
shaft such as clutches or gear shifting devices. It is 
an alternative to splined connection.
Fig. 9.20 Feather Key
9.12 WOODRUFF KEY
A Woodruff key is a sunk key in the form of an 
almost semicircular disk of uniform thickness as 
shown in Fig. 9.21. The keyway in the shaft is in 
the form of a semicircular recess with the same 
Fig. 9.21 Woodruff Key
curvature as that of the key. The bottom portion of 
the Woodruff key ﬁ ts into the circular keyway in the 
shaft. The keyway in the hub is made in the usual 
manner. The projecting part of Woodruff key ﬁ ts 
in the keyway in the hub. Once placed in position, 
the Woodruff key tilts and aligns itself on the shaft. 
The advantages of Woodruff key are as follows:
 
(i) The Woodruff key can be used on tapered 
shaft because it can align by slight rotation 
in the seat.
 (ii) The extra depth of key in the shaft prevents 
its tendency to slip over the shaft.
The disadvantages of Woodruff key are as 
follows:
 
(i) The extra depth of keyway in the shaft increase 
stress concentration and reduces its strength.
 (ii) The key does not permit axial movement 
between the shaft and the hub.
Woodruff keys are used on tapered shafts in 
machine tools and automobiles.
9.13 DESIGN OF SQUARE AND
 
FLAT KEYS
Although there are many types of keys, only 
square and ﬂ at keys are extensively used in 
practice. Therefore, the discussion in this chapter is 
restricted to square and ﬂ at keys. A square key is 
a particular type of ﬂ at key, in which the height is 
equal to the width of the cross-section. Therefore, 
for the purpose of analysis, a ﬂ at key is considered.
The forces acting on a ﬂ at key, with width 
as b and height as h, are shown in Fig. 9.22. The

transmission of torque from the shaft to the hub 
results in two equal and opposite forces denoted 
by P. The torque Mt is transmitted by means of a 
force P acting on the left surface AC of the key. 
The equal and opposite force P, acting on the right 
surface DB of the key is the reaction of the hub 
on the key. It is observed that the force P on left 
surface AC and its equal and opposite reaction P 
on the right surface DB are not in the same plane. 
Therefore, forces P1 (P1 = P) act as resisting couple 
preventing the key to roll in the keyway.
The exact location of the force P on the surface 
AC is unknown. In order to simplify the analysis, it 
is assumed that the force P is tangential to the shaft 
diameter.

The design of square or ﬂ at key is based on 
two criteria, viz., failure due to shear stress and 
failure due to compressive stress. The shear failure 
will occur in the plane AB. It is illustrated in Fig.

Therefore, the compressive stress induced in a 
square key due to the transmitted torque is twice 
the shear stress.
Example 9.13 It is required to design a square 
key for ﬁ xing a gear on a shaft of 25 mm diameter. 
The shaft is transmitting 15 kW power at 720 rpm 
to the gear. The key is made of steel 50C4 (Syt = 
460 N/mm2) and the factor of safety is 3. For key 
material, the yield strength in compression can be 
assumed to be equal to the yield strength in tension. 
Determine the dimensions of the key.

9.14 DESIGN OF KENNEDY KEY
The Kennedy key consists of two square keys as 
shown in Fig. 9.24. In this case, the hub is bored 
off the centre and the two keys force the hub and 
the shaft to a concentric position. Kennedy key is 
used for heavy duty applications. The analysis of 
the Kennedy key is similar to that of the ﬂ at key.

It is based on two criteria, viz., failure due to shear 
stress and failure due to compressive stress. The 
forces acting on one of the two Kennedy keys are 
shown in Fig. 9.25. Since there are two keys, the 
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 353
torque transmitted by each key is one half of the 
total torque. The two equal and opposite forces 
P are due to the transmitted torque. The exact

9.15 SPLINES
Splines are keys which are made integral with 
the shaft. They are used when there is a relative 
axial motion between the shaft and the hub. The 
gear shifting mechanism in automobile gearboxes 
requires such type of construction. Splines are cut on 
the shaft by milling and on the hub by broaching. A 
splined connection, with straight splines, is shown in 
Fig. 9.27. The following notations are used:
Fig. 9.27 Splines: (a) Shaft (b) Hub
D = major diameter of splines (mm)
d = minor diameter of splines (mm)
l = length of hub (mm)
n = number of splines

The torque transmitting capacity of splines is 
given by,
 
Mt = pm A Rm

where,
Mt = transmitted torque (N-mm)

The above analysis and Fig. 9.27 refer to 
straight-sided splines. In addition, there are two 
other types of splines, namely, involute splines and 
serrations as shown in Fig. 9.28.
(a) Straight sided splines
(b) Involute splines
(c) Serrations
Fig. 9.28 Types of Spline Proﬁ les
(i) Involute Splines Involute splines are in the 
form of concentric external and internal gear teeth. 
They are stub teeth with a pressure angle of 30°. 
These splines are speciﬁ ed by module. Involute 
splines are more popular than straight splines due 
to greater strength relative to their size. Involute 
splines are self centering and tend to adjust to an 
even distribution of load. However, the cost of 
involute splines is more than straight-sided splines.
(ii) Serrations Straight-sided serrations are used 
in applications where it is important to keep the 
overall size of the assembly as small as possible. 
They are used as interference joints. Serration 
joints are also used to obtain small angular relative 
adjustment between the joined members.
Example 9.17 
A standard splined connection
8 ¥ 52 ¥ 60 mm is used for the gear and the shaft 
assembly of a gearbox. The splines transmit 20 kW 
power at 300 rpm. The dimensions of the splines 
are as follows:
Major diameter = 60 mm
Minor diameter = 52 mm
Number of splines = 8 
Permissible normal pressure on splines is
6.5 N/mm2. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.06. 
Calculate: 
 
(i) The length of hub of the gear 
 (ii) The force required for shifting the gear
Solution
Given kW = 20 n = 300 rpm pm = 6.5 N/mm2

9.16 COUPLINGS
A coupling can be deﬁ ned as a mechanical device 
that permanently joins two rotating shafts to each 
other. The most common application of coupling 
is joining of shafts of two separately built or 
purchased units so that a new machine can be 
formed. For example, a coupling is used to join 
the output shaft of an engine to the input shaft of a 
hydraulic pump to raise water from well. A coupling 
is used to join the output shaft of an electric motor 
to the input shaft of a gearbox in machine tools. A 
coupling is also used to join the output shaft of an 
electric motor to the input shaft of a compressor. 
There is a basic difference between a coupling and 
a clutch. Coupling is a permanent connection, while 
the clutch can connect or disconnect two shafts at 
the will of the operator. 
The shafts to be connected by the coupling may 
have collinear axes, intersecting axes or parallel 
axes with a small distance in between. Oldham 
coupling is used to connect two parallel shafts 
when they are at a small distance apart. Hooke’s 
coupling is used to connect two shafts having 
intersecting axes. When the axes are collinear or in 
the same line, rigid or ﬂ exible couplings are used. 
While the ﬂ exible coupling is capable of tolerating 
a small amount of misalignment between the shafts, 
there is no such provision in rigid coupling. The 
discussion in this chapter is restricted to rigid and 
ﬂ exible couplings. Oldham and Hooke’s couplings 
are covered in more detail in textbooks on Theory 
of Machines.
The difference between rigid and ﬂ exible 
couplings is as follows:
 
(i) A 
rigid 
coupling 
cannot 
tolerate 
misalignment between the axes of the shafts. 
It can be used only when there is precise 
alignment between two shafts. On the other 
hand, the ﬂ exible coupling, due to provision 
of ﬂ exible elements like bush or disk, can 
tolerate 0.5° of angular misalignment and 5 
mm of axial displacement between the shafts.
 (ii) The ﬂ exible elements provided in the ﬂ exible 
coupling absorb shocks and vibrations. There 
is no such provision in rigid coupling. It can 
be used only where the motion is free from 
shocks and vibrations.
 (iii) Rigid coupling is simple and inexpensive. 
Flexible coupling is comparatively costlier 
due to additional parts.
In practice, misalignment always exists due 
to imperfect workmanship. Therefore, ﬂ exible 
couplings are more popular. 
A good coupling, rigid or ﬂ exible, should satisfy 
the following requirements:
 
(i) The 
coupling 
should 
be 
capable 
of 
transmitting torque from the driving shaft to 
the driven shaft.
 (ii) The coupling should keep the two shafts in 
proper alignment.
 (iii) The coupling should be easy to assemble 
and disassemble for the purpose of repairs 
and alterations.
 (iv) The failure of revolving bolt heads, nuts, key 
heads and other projecting parts may cause 
accidents. They should be covered by giving 
suitable shape to the ﬂ anges or by providing 
guards.
The couplings are standardized7, 8 and can be 
purchased as readymade units.

Shafts, Keys and Couplings 357
9.17 MUFF COUPLING
Muff coupling is also called sleeve coupling 
or box coupling. It is a type of rigid coupling. 
The construction of the muff coupling is shown 
in Fig. 9.29. It consists of a sleeve or a hollow 
cylinder, which is ﬁ tted over the ends of input and 
output shafts by means of a sunk key. The torque 
is transmitted from the input shaft to the sleeve 
through the key. It is then transmitted from the 
sleeve to the output shaft through the key. Muff 
coupling has following advantages:
 
(i) It is the simplest form of coupling with only 
two parts, viz., sleeve and key. It is simple to 
design and manufacture.
 (ii) It has no projecting parts except the key-
head. The external surface of the sleeve 
is smooth. This is an advantage from the 
standpoint of safety to the operator.
 (iii) It has compact construction with small radial 
dimensions.
 (iv) It is cheaper than other types of coupling.

Sleeve
Fig. 9.29 Muff Coupling
Muff coupling has following disadvantages: 
 
(i) Muff coupling is difﬁ cult to assemble or 
dismantle. The sleeve has to be either shifted 
over the shaft by half of its length or the 
ends of the shafts have to be drawn together 
or apart by half length of the sleeve.
 (ii) It is a rigid type of coupling and requires 
accurate alignment of shafts. It cannot 
tolerate misalignment between the axes 
of two shafts. The misalignment of shafts, 
caused by inaccurate assembly, induces 
forces, which tend to bend the shafts.
 (iii) Since there is no ﬂ exible element in the cou-
pling, it cannot absorb shocks and vibrations. 
It can be used only where the motion is free 
from vibrations. 
 (iv) It requires more axial space compared with 
ﬂ ange couplings.
Owing to these shortcomings, muff couplings are 
less popular compared with ﬂ ange couplings. They 
are employed for shafts only up to 70 mm diameter.
Muff coupling is usually designed on shop ﬂ oors 
by assuming standard proportions for the dimen-
sions of the sleeve. These empirical relationships 
were developed by practicing engineers on the
basis of their past experience. In general, such
proportions result in robust design. For the sleeve 
of muff coupling, the standard proportions used in 
practice are as follows:
 
D = (2d + 13) mm 
(9.33)
and  
L = 3.5 d 
(9.34)
where, D = outer diameter of the sleeve (mm)
 
L = axial length of the sleeve (mm)
 
d = diameter of the shaft (mm)
The diameter of the shaft, in the above 
relationships, is determined by the usual method. 
The free body diagram of torsional moments acting 
on various components of the muff coupling is 
shown in Fig. 9.30. The torsional shear stress in 
Fig. 9.30 Free-body Diagram for Torques
the sleeve is calculated by treating it as a hollow 
shaft subjected to torsional moment.

DESIGN PROCEDURE FOR MUFF

With these dimensions of the key, check the 
shear and compressive stresses in the key by Eqs 
(9.27) and (9.28) respectively.

The shafts and key are made of plain carbon

of Grade FG 200.
Example 9.18

(Sut = 200 N/mm2). The factor of safety for the 
shafts and key is 4. For the sleeve, the factor of 
safety is 6 based on ultimate strength.
Solution

9.19 CLAMP COUPLING
The clamp coupling is also called compression 
coupling or split muff coupling. It is a rigid type 
of coupling. In this coupling, the sleeve is made of 
two halves, which are split along a plane passing 
through the axes of shafts. The construction of the 
clamp coupling is shown in Fig. 9.31. The two 
halves of the sleeve are clamped together by means 
of bolts. The number of bolts can be four or eight. 
They are always in multiples of four. The bolts 
are placed in recesses formed in the sleeve halves. 
A small clearance is provided in the parting plane 
between the two halves. Therefore, when the bolts 
are tightened, a force is exerted between the sleeve 
halves and the shaft. This force caused by clamping 
of bolts creates frictional force on the surface of 
the shaft. The torque is transmitted by means of 
frictional force on the surface of the shaft. There 
is also a key between the shafts and sleeve, which 
also transmits torque. It is not possible to ﬁ nd out 
what percentage of torque is transmitted by friction 
or by the key. In design, it is assumed that total 
torque is transmitted by friction as well as by the 
key. In other words, the key is designed for total 
torque. Also, the clamping bolts are designed 
for total torque. As shown in Fig. 9.31, power is 
transmitted from the input shaft to the sleeve and 
from the sleeve to the output shaft by means of 
the key and friction between the sleeve halves and 
the shaft. The clamp coupling has the following 
advantages: 
 
(i) It is easy to assemble and dismantle.
 (ii) It can be easily removed without shifting 
the shaft in axial direction, unlike solid muff 
coupling.
 (iii) As compared with ﬂ ange coupling, clamp 
coupling has small diametral dimensions.

The disadvantages of clamp coupling are as 
follows:
 
(i) There is difﬁ culty in dynamic balancing of the 
coupling. Therefore, it is not possible to use the 
clamp coupling for high-speed applications.
 (ii) Clamp coupling is unsuitable for shock loads.
 (iii) It is necessary to provide a guard for 
the coupling to comply with the factory 
regulation act.
The main application of clamp coupling is for 
line shaft in power transmission. Nowadays, the 
line shaft and the clamp coupling have become 
obsolete.
There is a fundamental difference between the 
working of muff and clamp couplings. In muff 
coupling, torque is transmitted by shear resistance 
of keys. On the other hand, torque is transmitted 
partly by means of friction between the sleeve 
360 Design of Machine Elements
halves and the shaft and partly by shear resistance 
of key in case of clamp coupling.
Clamp coupling is usually designed on the 
basis of standard proportions for sleeve halves and 
clamping bolts.
For sleeve halves,
 
D = 2.5d 
(9.35)
 
L = 3.5d 
(9.36)
where
 
D = outer diameter of sleeve halves (mm)
 
L = length of sleeve (mm)
 
d = diameter of shaft (mm)
For clamping bolts,
 
d1 = 0.2d + 10  mm 
(9.37)
when 
d < 55 mm
and
 
d1 = 0.15d + 15  mm 
(9.38)
when 
d > 55 mm
where,
d1 = diameter of clamping bolt (mm)
Alternatively, the diameter of the clamping bolts 
can be calculated from the ﬁ rst principle. Let us 
assume that even with key, the torque is transmitted 
only by the friction between the shaft and the 
coupling halves.
The clamping force of each bolt is given by,

(9.39)
where
P1 = tensile force on each bolt (N)
d1 = core diameter of clamping bolt (mm)

It is assumed that half the number of bolts give 
clamping pressure on input shaft and the remaining 
half on the output shaft. Therefore, clamping force 
on each shaft is given by,

Alternatively, standard proportions can be used 
for calculating the bolt diameter. Equations (9.37) 
and (9.38) are used for this purpose. The coefﬁ cient 
of friction between the sleeve halves and the shaft 
is usually taken as 0.3.
Example 9.19 It is required to design a split muff 
coupling to transmit 50 kW power at 120 rpm The 
shafts, key and clamping bolts are made of plain 
carbon steel 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2). The yield 
strength in compression is 150% of the tensile yield 
strength. The factor of safety for shafts, key and 
bolts is 5. The number of clamping bolts is 8. The 
coefﬁ cient of friction between sleeve halves and the 
shaft is 0.3.
 
(i) Calculate the diameter of the input and 
output shafts.
 (ii) Specify the length and outer diameter of the 
sleeve halves.
 (iii) Find out the diameter of clamping bolts 
assuming that the power is transmitted by 
friction.

standard 
empirical relations.
 (v) Specify the size of key and check the 
dimensions for shear and compression criteria.

9.21 RIGID FLANGE COUPLINGS
A ﬂ ange coupling consists of two ﬂ anges—one 
keyed to the driving shaft and the other to the 
driven shaft as shown in Fig. 9.33. The two ﬂ anges 
are connected together by means of four or six 
bolts arranged on a circle concentric with the axes 
of the shafts. Power is transmitted from the driving 
Fig. 9.33 Unprotected Type Flange Coupling
shaft to the left side ﬂ ange through the key. It is 
then transmitted from the left side ﬂ ange to the 
right side ﬂ ange through the bolts. Finally, power 
is transmitted from the right side ﬂ ange to the 
driven shaft through the key. Since ﬂ ange coupling 
is rigid type of coupling, provision should be made 
for precise location of the axes of two shafts. The 
mating ﬂ anges have spigot and recess for precise 
location. The left side ﬂ ange has a cylindrical 
projection called spigot while the right side ﬂ ange 
has a corresponding recess. The diameters of the 
spigot and the recess are machined with more 
accuracy. During the assembly, the spigot ﬁ ts into 
the recess and the two ﬂ anges are located precisely 
with respect to each other. This ensures alignment 
of the axes of the two shafts. 
There are two types of rigid ﬂ ange couplings—
unprotected and protected. The ﬂ ange coupling 
shown in Fig. 9.33 is the unprotected type of 
coupling. The revolving bolt heads and nuts are 
dangerous to the operator and may lead to accident. 
Protected type ﬂ ange coupling is shown in Fig. 
9.34. In this case, protecting circumferential rims 
cover the bolt heads and nuts. In case of failure of 
bolts while the machine is being run, the broken 
pieces will dash against this rim and eventually fall 
down. This protects the operator against injuries.
Fig. 9.34 Protected Type Rigid Coupling
The rigid ﬂ ange couplings have the following 
advantages:
 
(i) Rigid coupling has high torque transmitting 
capacity.
 (ii) Rigid coupling is easy to assemble and 
dismantle.
 (iii) Rigid coupling has simple construction. It is 
easy to design and manufacture.
The rigid ﬂ ange couplings have the following 
disadvantages:
 
(i) It is a rigid type of coupling. It cannot 
tolerate misalignment between the axes of 
two shafts.
 (ii) It can be used only where the motion is free 
from shocks and vibrations.
 (iii) It requires more radial space.
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 363
Rigid ﬂ ange couplings are widely used for 
transmitting large torques.
The ﬂ ange of the protected type coupling has 
three distinct regions—inner hub, central ﬂ ange 
with boltholes and peripheral outer rim as shown in 
Fig. 9.35. The hub is provided with a keyway. The 
Fig. 9.35 Proportions of Rigid Coupling
function of the hub is to transmit the torque from 
the shaft to the central ﬂ ange and vice versa. 
The central portion of the ﬂ ange has holes to 
accommodate the bolts. Torque is transmitted from 
one ﬂ ange to the other by means of these bolts. 
The outer circumferential rim is for the purpose of 
safety to cover the projecting bolt heads and nuts.  
Various dimensions of ﬂ anges are shown in Fig. 
9.35. Many times, the dimensions of the ﬂ anges are 
calculated by using standard proportions in terms 
of shaft diameter. Shop-ﬂ oor engineers have used 
such empirical formulae for many years without 
any problem. It is easy to design the coupling 
using these standard proportions, because no stress 
analysis is involved. The dimensions calculated by 
these formulae result in robust design. The standard 
proportions for various dimensions of the ﬂ ange 
shown in Fig. 9.35 are as follows:
 
(i) dh = outside diameter of hub 
 
dh = 2d
 (ii) lh = length of hub or effective length of key
 
lh = 1.5 d
 (iii) D = pitch circle diameter of bolts 
 
D = 3d
 (iv) t = thickness of ﬂ anges
 
t = 0.5 d
 (v) t1 = thickness of protecting rim 
 
t1 = 0.25 d
 (vi) dr = diameter of spigot and recess 
 
dr = 1.5 d
 (vii) D0 = outside diameter of ﬂ ange 
 
D0 = (4d + 2t1)
In the above relationships, d is the shaft 
diameter.
The number of bolts (N) is also decided from the 
shaft diameter in the following way:
N = 3 for shafts up to 40 mm diameter
N = 4 for shafts from 40 to 100 mm diameter
N = 6 for shafts from 100 to 180 mm diameter.
The analysis of rigid coupling can be done by 
two different ways, depending upon the clearance 
between the bolt and the hole. In the ﬁ rst approach, 
the bolts are ﬁ tted in reamed and ground holes. In 
this case, there is no clearance and the bolts are 
ﬁ nger tight. Therefore, power is transmitted by 
means of shear resistance of the bolts. In the second 
364 Design of Machine Elements
approach, the bolts are ﬁ tted in large clearance 
holes. In this case, bolts are tightened with a pre-
load and power is transmitted by means of friction 
between the two ﬂ anges.

where,

Fig. 9.36 Shear Resistance of Bolts
It should be noted that the bolts are subjected to 
direct shear stress due to the force P and not torsional 
shear stress. No torque is acting about the axis of the 
bolt. The force P results in only direct shear stress.

Equation (9.41) is used to determine the nominal

coupling is based on the assumption that the bolts are 
ﬁ tted in rimmed and ground holes. The bolts are ﬁ nger 
tight in these holes and there is no clearance between 
the holes and the nominal diameter of the bolts.
Case II Bolts 
Fitted 
in 
Large

Holes When the bolts are ﬁ tted in large clearance 
holes, the above analysis is not applicable. In this 
case, the bolts are sufﬁ ciently tightened with a pre-
load and the torque is transmitted from one ﬂ ange

uniformly distributed pressure, the friction radius

Flanges have complex shape and the easiest 
method to make the ﬂ anges is casting. Flanges are 
usually made of grey cast iron of grade FG 200. 
The bolts, keys and shaft are made of plain carbon 
steels on strength criterion.

Example 9.21 
A rigid coupling is used to 
transmit 50 kW power at 300 rpm. There are six 
bolts. The outer diameter of the ﬂ anges is 200 mm, 
while the recess diameter is 150 mm. The coefﬁ cient 
of friction between the ﬂ anges is 0.15. The bolts are 
made of steel 45C8 (Syt = 380 N/mm2) and the factor 
of safety is 3. Determine the diameter of the bolts.
Assume that the bolts are ﬁ tted in large 
clearance holes.
Solution
Given kW = 50 n = 300 rpm m = 0.15
For bolts,  Syt = 380 N/mm2 (fs) = 3 N = 6
For ﬂ anges, Do = 200 mm Di = 150 mm

Example 9.22 
It is required to design a rigid 
type of ﬂ ange coupling to connect two shafts. The 
input shaft transmits 37.5 kW power at 180 rpm to 
the output shaft through the coupling. The service 
factor for the application is 1.5, i.e., the design 
torque is 1.5 times of the rated torque. Select 
suitable materials for various parts of the coupling, 
design the coupling and specify the dimensions of 
its components.
Solution
Given kW = 37.5 n = 180 rpm
design torque = 1.5 ( rated torque)
Step I Selection of materials
 
(i) The shafts are subjected to torsional shear 
stress. On the basis of strength, plain carbon 
steel of grade 40C8 (Syt = 380 N/mm2) is 
used for the shaft. The factor of safety for 
the shafts is assumed to be 2.5. 
 (ii) The keys and bolts are subjected to shear 
and compressive stresses. On the basis of 
strength criterion, plain carbon steel of grade 
30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) is selected for the 
keys and the bolts. It is assumed that the 
compressive yield strength is 150% of the 
tensile yield strength. The factor of safety 
for the keys and the bolts is taken as 2.5.
 (iii) Flanges have complex shape and the easiest 
method to make the ﬂ anges is casting. Grey 
cast iron FG 200 (Sut = 200 N/mm2) is 
selected as the material for the ﬂ anges from 
manufacturing considerations. It is assumed 
that ultimate shear strength is one half of the 
ultimate tensile strength. The factor of safety 
for the ﬂ anges is assumed as 6, since the 
permissible stress is based on the ultimate 
strength and not on the yield strength.

Step IV Dimensions of ﬂ anges
The dimensions of the ﬂ anges are as follows,
dh = 2d = 2 (60) = 120 mm
lh = 1.5d = 1.5 (60) = 90 mm
D = 3d = 3(60) = 180 mm
t = 0.5d = 0.5(60) = 30 mm
t1 = 0.25d = 0.25(60) = 15 mm
dr = 1.5d = 1.5(60) = 90 mm
D0 = (4d +2t1) =  4(60) + 2(15) = 270 mm
The above dimensions of the ﬂ ange are shown 
in Fig. 9.37. The thickness of recess is assumed as

9.23 BUSHED-PIN FLEXIBLE COUPLING
Rigid coupling can be used only when there is 
perfect alignment between the axes of two shafts 
and the motion is free from vibrations and shocks. 
In practice, it is impossible to obtain perfect 
alignment of shafts. Misalignment exists due to the 
following reasons:
 
(i) deﬂ ection of shafts due to lateral forces;
 (ii) error in shaft mounting due to manufacturing 
tolerances;
 (iii) use of two separately manufactured units such 
as an electric motor and a worm gear box; and
 (iv) thermal expansion of the parts.
If rigid coupling is used in such circumstances, 
the misalignment causes excessive bearing reactions 
resulting in vibrations and wear. To overcome this 
problem, ﬂ exible couplings are used. A ﬂ exible 
coupling employs a ﬂ exible element like a rubber 
bush between the driving and the driven ﬂ anges. 
This ﬂ exible rubber bush not only accommodates 
the misalignment but also absorbs shocks and
vibrations. The basic types of misalignment
between axes of the input and output shafts are 
shown in Fig. 9.38. A ﬂ exible coupling can tolerate 
0.5 mm of lateral or axial misalignment and 1.5° of 
angular misalignment.
Fig. 9.38 Types of Misalignment
The construction of the ﬂ exible coupling is 
shown in Fig. 9.39. It is similar to the rigid type of 
ﬂ ange coupling except for the provision of rubber 
bush and pins in place of bolts. The coupling 
consists of two ﬂ anges, one keyed to the input 
shaft and the other to the output shaft. The two 
ﬂ anges are connected together by means of four or 
six pins. At one end, the pin is ﬁ xed to the output 
ﬂ ange by means of a nut. The diameter of the 
pin is enlarged in the input ﬂ ange where a rubber 
bush is mounted over the pin. The rubber bush is 
provided with brass lining at the inner surface. The 
lining reduces the wear of the inner surface of the 
rubber bush. Power is transmitted from the input 
shaft to the input ﬂ ange through the key. It is then 
transmitted from the input ﬂ ange to the pin through 
the rubber bush. The pin then transmits the power 
to the output ﬂ ange by shear resistance. Finally, 
power is transmitted from the output ﬂ ange to the 
output shaft through the key.
The bushed-pin type ﬂ exible coupling has 
following advantages:
 
(i) It can tolerate 0.5 mm of lateral or axial 
misalignment and 1.5° of angular misalign-
ment.
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 369
Fig. 9.39 Flexible Coupling
 (ii) It prevents transmission of shock from one 
shaft to the other and absorbs vibrations.
 (iii) It can be used for transmitting high torques.
 (iv) It is simple in construction and easy to 
assemble and dismantle. It is easy to design 
and manufacture the coupling.
The disadvantages of bushed-pin type ﬂ exible 
coupling are as follows:
 
(i) The cost of ﬂ exible coupling is more than 
that of rigid coupling due to additional parts.
 (ii) It requires more radial space compared with 
other types of coupling.
Flexible bushed-pin type couplings are exten-
sively used in practice due to their advantages.
The dimensions of the ﬂ anges of ﬂ exible 
bushed-pin coupling are calculated by using stan-
dard proportions in terms of shaft diameter. There 
is a basic difference between the ﬂ anges of rigid 
and ﬂ exible couplings. In rigid coupling, two ﬂ ang-
es are identical except for the provision of spigot 
and recess. In ﬂ exible coupling, the input ﬂ ange 
accommodates the rubber bushes of comparatively 
large diameter than the diameter of the pins accom-
modated in the output ﬂ ange as shown in Fig. 9.39. 
Therefore, the diameter of holes and the thick-
ness of the two ﬂ anges are different. The standard 
proportions for various dimensions of the ﬂ anges 
shown in Fig. 9.39 are as follows:
 
(i) dh = outside diameter of hub
 
 dh = 2d
 (ii) lh = length of hub or effective length of key
 
 lh = 1.5 d
 (iii) D = pitch circle diameter of pins
 
 D = 3d to 4d
 (iv) t = thickness of output ﬂ ange
 
 t = 0.5 d
 (v) t1  = thickness of protective rim 
 
 t1 = 0.25 d
 (vi) d1 = diameter of pin
 
 d1 = 0 5. d
N
where N is the number of pins and d is the shaft 
diameter.
Other dimensions of ﬂ anges, viz., outer diameter 
or thickness of the input ﬂ ange are calculated after 
deciding the dimensions of the rubber bushes.
In analysis of ﬂ exible coupling, it is assumed 
that the power is transmitted by the shear resistance 
of the pins. As the ﬂ ange on the input shaft rotates, 
it exerts a force P on each rubber bush. The 
resisting forces on the rubber bushes are shown 
in Fig. 9.40. Equating the couples due to resisting 
force with the torque,

The projected area of the rubber bush is shown

Therefore,

According to Indian standard9, the allowable 
shear stress for pins is 35 N/mm2. 
The pin is also subjected to bending moment and 
the calculations of bending stresses are explained in 
the examples.
The ﬂ anges of ﬂ exible bush coupling are made 
of grey cast iron of grade FG 200. The pins are 
made of carbon steel. The recommended type 
of ﬁ t between the shaft and the hub is H7-j7. 
The maximum allowable peripheral speed of the 
coupling is 30 m/s.
There are two important features of ﬂ exible 
bush coupling, which are different than rigid ﬂ ange 
coupling. They are as follows:
 
(i) As shown in Fig. 9.39, there is a gap or 
clearance between the driving and driven 
ﬂ anges of ﬂ exible bush coupling. This 
gap is essential for taking care of angular 
misalignment between the two shafts. There 
is no such clearance between the ﬂ anges of 
rigid coupling. Therefore, rigid coupling 
cannot tolerate any angular misalignment.
 9 IS 2693–1980: Speciﬁ cation for bush-type ﬂ exible coupling for power transmission.
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 371
 (ii) In case of rigid coupling, the torque is 
transmitted by means of bolts. These bolts 
are made of steel and resisting shear or tensile 
stresses are high. Therefore, the diameter of 
the bolts or the pitch circle diameter of bolts 
is comparatively less than that of ﬂ exible 
bush coupling. On the other hand, the torque 
is transmitted by means of a force passing 
through a rubber bush in case of ﬂ exible bush 
coupling. The permissible pressure between 
the rubber bush and cast iron ﬂ ange is only 1 
N/mm2. Therefore, the diameter of the pin or 
pitch circle diameter of pins is comparatively 
large than that of rigid ﬂ ange coupling. It 
should be noted that for connecting shafts 
of a particular size, ﬂ exible bush coupling 
either has greater number of bolts (or pins) 
than rigid coupling or has larger bolt circle 
diameter than rigid coupling. This reduces 
the force acting on the bolts (pins) and lowers 
bearing pressure on the rubber bush.
Couplings, whether rigid or ﬂ exible, should be 
located very near to the bearing on the shaft. This 
reduces the bending moment acting on the shafts 
due to coupling forces. This is the most satisfactory 
location of coupling.

It is required to design a bushed-

of an electric motor to the shaft of a centrifugal 
pump. The motor delivers 20 kW power at 720 rpm. 
The starting torque of the motor can be assumed to

compressive stresses. The pins are subjected 
to shear and bending stresses. On the basis 
of strength criterion, plain carbon steel of 
grade 30C8 (Syt = 400 N/mm2) is selected for 
the keys and the pins. The factor of safety 
for the keys and the pins is taken as 2. It is 
assumed that the compressive yield strength 
is 150% of the tensile yield strength.
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 373
 (iii) Flanges have complicated shape and the 
economic method to make the ﬂ anges 
is casting. Grey cast iron of grade FG 
200 (Sut = 200 N/mm2) is selected as the 
material for the ﬂ anges from manufacturing 
considerations. It is assumed that the 
ultimate shear strength is one-half of the 
ultimate tensile strength. The factor of safety 
for the ﬂ anges is assumed as 6, since the 
permissible stress is based on the ultimate 
strength and not on the yield strength.

In the initial stages, the diameter of the pin was 
calculated as 7 mm by using empirical formula.
It was sufﬁ cient to keep the maximum shear
stress within limit. The shear stress induced in the 
pin was 28.72 N/mm2 and the limiting stress was 
35 N/mm2. However, it is observed that a 7 mm 
diameter pin is not sufﬁ cient to withstand bending 
stresses and the minimum diameter of the pin 
should be 12 mm. Therefore, bending becomes the 
criterion of design.
As shown in Fig. 9.43, the diameter of the pin 
should be enlarged at the section-XX in order to ﬁ x 
the pin in the driven ﬂ ange. This enlarged diameter 
is taken as (12 + 6) or 18 mm. Other dimensions 
of the pin and the bush are shown in Fig. 9.44. The 
thickness of the brass lining is 2 mm. Therefore, the

rubber bush is (22 + 20) or 42 mm. The dimensions of 
the driving ﬂ ange are shown in Fig. 9.45.

From Table 9.3, the standard cross-section of a ﬂ at

Example 9.25 
A multiﬂ ex ﬂ exible coupling, 
transmitting 15 kW power at 720 rpm, is shown 
in Fig. 9.46. It consists of two ﬂ anges keyed to the 
driving and driven shafts and connected together 
by means of a number of coils. The coils are placed 
in the slots on the periphery of the ﬂ anges at a 
distance of 30 mm from the axes of the shafts. The 
coils have a rectangular cross-section  4 ¥ 2 mm 
and are made of steel FeE 220 (Syt = 220 N/mm2). 
The factor of safety is 2.5. Calculate the required

376 Design of Machine Elements
9.25 DESIGN FOR LATERAL RIGIDITY
In certain applications, the components are designed 
on the basis of lateral rigidity rather than on strength. 
A component is considered as rigid when it does not 
deﬂ ect or bend too much due to external forces or 
moments. Permissible deﬂ ection is the criterion for 
design in these cases. When a transmission shaft 
supporting a gear is deﬂ ected, the meshing of the 
gear teeth is not proper. This results in an uneven 
distribution of load over the face width of the gear, 
causing early failure. The shaft deﬂ ection also results 
in a misalign ment between the axes of the shaft 
and the bearing, causing uneven wear of bearing 
surfaces. The radial clearance in hydrodynamic 
bearing is affected by the shaft deﬂ ection. In design 
of machine tool components, rigidity governs the 
accuracy of the machining method.
The maximum permissible deﬂ ection for the 
transmission shaft is generally taken as
d = (0.001)L 
to 
(0.003)L
where L is the span length between the two 
bearings. The maximum permissible deﬂ ection at 
the gear is taken as
d = (0.01)m
where m is the module of the gear teeth. In practice, 
the lateral rigidity of the structure is improved by 
the following methods:
 
(i)  reduce the span length;
 (ii)  increase the number of supports;
 (iii)  reduce the number of joints;
 (iv)  assemble the components with pre-load;
 (v)  lubricate the contact surfaces with high 
viscosity oil; and
 (vi) select a cross-section in which the cross-
sectional area is away from the neutral axis, 
such as an I or tubular section.
The lateral deﬂ ection depends upon the dimensions 
of the shaft, forces acting on the shaft, and the 
modulus of elasticity. The modulus of elasticity is 
practically same for all types of steel, whether plain 
carbon steel or alloy steel. It is not advisable to use 
expensive alloy steels where lateral deﬂ ection is the 
design criterion. Plain carbon steel is, therefore, a 
better choice as a shaft material when the component 
is designed on the basis of lateral rigidity.
The determination of the deﬂ ection of beams 
is extensively covered in Strength of Materials. 
Important methods for determining the lateral 
deﬂ ection of beams are as follows: 
 
(i)  double integration method; 
 (ii)  area moment method;
 (iii)  strain energy method; and
 (iv)  graphical integration method.
In simple cases, the standard formulae from 
Strength of Materials, which are given in Table 9.4, 
are used. Sometimes, the principle of superim position 
of deﬂ ection is used. According to this principle, the 
deﬂ ection at any point in the shaft is equal to the sum 
of deﬂ ections, caused by each load separately.
Example 9.26 
Consider the forces acting on 
the intermediate shaft of a gearbox illustrated in 
Example 9.4. The maximum permissible radial 
deﬂ ection at any gear is limited to 1 mm. The 
modulus of elasticity of the shaft material is 207000 
N/mm2. Determine the shaft diameter and compare 
it with the solution of Example 9.4.

In Example 9.4, the shaft diameter was

while in this problem the same has been calculated 
as 114.67 mm on the basis of rigidity. Therefore, 
rigidity becomes the criterion of design in this case.
9.26 CASTIGLIANO’S THEOREM
One of the important techniques of determining the 
deﬂ ection of a complex structure is the application 
of Castigliano’s theorem. The theorem states
‘When a body is elastically deﬂ ected by any 
combination of forces or moments, the deﬂ ection at 
any point and any direction is equal to the partial 
derivative of total strain energy of the body with 
respect to the force located at that point and acting 
in that direction’. 
Consider an elastic body subjected to a system 
of forces P1, P2, P3, etc. Suppose U is the total 
strain energy of the body. d1, d2, d3,…, etc., are 
deﬂ ections at the point of application and in the 
direction of P1, P2, P3, etc. Then according to this 
theorem,

Castigliano’s theorem can be used to determine 
the deﬂ ection at a point where no force is acting. 
In such a case, we assume an imaginary force 
Q at such a point and in the direction in which 
the deﬂ ection is to be determined. The partial 
derivative (∂U / ∂Q) gives the desired deﬂ ection 
when Q is equated to zero. Castigliano’s theorem is 
applicable only in the elastic range of the materials.
Example 9.27 
A transmission shaft with a 
uniformly distributed load of 10 N/mm is shown in 
Fig. 9.48(a). The maximum permissible deﬂ ection 
of the shaft is (0.003L), where L is the span length. 
The modulus of elasticity of the shaft material is 
207 000 N/mm2. Determine the shaft diameter by 
Castigliano’s theorem.

Step II Deﬂ ection at centre of span

9.27 AREA MOMENT METHOD
The area moment method is sometimes convenient 
for determining the deﬂ ection of the shaft due 
to bending moments. To illustrate the method, 
consider a simply supported beam with centre load 
as shown in Fig. 9.49(a). The basic principle of this 
method is stated as ‘The vertical distance of any 
point C on the elastic curve of the shaft, from the 
tangent at any other point A on the elastic curve, is 
equal to the moment of the area of (M/EI) diagram 
between A and C with respect to the ordinate 
through C ’. A tangent is drawn at the point A to 
the elastic curve [Fig. 9.49(b)]. (d1) is the vertical 
distance of the point C from the tangent. The (M/
EI) diagram is shown in Fig. 9.49(c). Taking the 
moment of (M/EI) diagram about the ordinate 
through C, we have

9.28 GRAPHICAL INTEGRATION   
 
METHOD
In some cases, the forces acting on the shaft and 
its geometry are such that it is not possible to 
use classical methods, such as the principle of 
superimposition or Castigliano’s theorem, to ﬁ nd out 
the deﬂ ection. Hence, here the graphical integra tion 
method is used. The main drawback of this method 
is its limited accuracy. The principle of this method 
is illustrated in Fig. 9.50. Let us consider a function,
y = f (x) 
in such a way that,
y = 200 units  
for 0  < x < 200
y = 350 units  
for 200 < x < 400
y = 300 units  
for 400 < x < 600
Sy = 10 units/mm

The function is plotted to the following scales:
Sx = 10 units/mm 
Sy = 10 units/mm
The graphical integration method consists of the 
following steps:
 
(i)  Select a pole point P. The distance OP is 
called the pole distance (H). In this case,
 
 H = 30 mm
 (ii)  Divide the area into suitable rectangles and 
project the mid-ordinates of these rectangles 
on the Y-axis.
 
 Join P–1, P–2, P–3
 (iii) Draw lines
 
 Op parallel to 
P–1
 
 pq parallel to  
P–2
 
 qr parallel to  
P–3
 (iv)  The scale of the integral is given by
Sy1 = H SxSy = 30(10)(10) = 3000(unit)2/mm 
At the point p, the ordinate is 13.33 mm and the 
value of integration is
13.33 ¥ 3000 = 40 000 (unit)2/mm
The area of the rectangle (200 ¥ 200) is 40000 
(unit)2, which proves the answer.
Example 9.28 A cantilever beam carrying a load 
of 500 N is shown in Fig. 9.51(a). The maximum 
permissible deﬂ ection of the beam is 0.05 mm. The 
modulus of elasticity of the material is 207000 
N/mm2. Using the graphical integration method, 
determine the size of the cross-section of the beam.

Fig. 9.51 Graphical Integration Method
Shafts, Keys and Couplings 385
The slope diagram shown in Fig. 9.51(d) is 
constructed by the graphical integration method. 
From the origin of the slope diagram, draw a line 
parallel to O11 of the (M/EI) diagram. This is the 
slope of part 1. Similar procedure is used for other 
parts. As discussed in the previous section, the 
scale of the slope diagram is given by,
Sy3 = H SxSy2 = 50(5/3)(1000/EI)
 
= (250 000/3EI) per mm 
The deﬂ ection diagram shown in Fig. 9.51(e), is 
constructed by the graphical integration of the slope 
diagram. Similar procedure is used in this case. The 
scale of the deﬂ ection diagram is given by,
Sy4 = H SxSy3 = 50(5/3) (250 000/3EI)
 
= (6944.44 × 103/EI) per mm 
As shown in the ﬁ gure, the actual dimension of 
the maximum deﬂ ection is 105 mm.
Therefore, 
dmax. = (105)(6944.44 × 103/EI) 
= (729.166 × 106/EI) mm

9.29 CRITICAL SPEED OF SHAFTS
The critical speed of the shaft is the speed at which 
the rotating shaft becomes dynamically unstable 
and starts to vibrate violently in a transverse 
direction. It is a very dangerous condition because 
the amplitude of vibration is so high that the shaft 
may break into pieces. The critical speed of the 
shaft is also called the ‘whirling’ speed or natural 
frequency of vibrations.
386 Design of Machine Elements
The centre of mass of a transmission shaft 
carrying gears, pulleys or sprockets never coincides 
with the centre of rotation. This is due to the  
following two reasons:
 
(i) It is practically impossible to machine a 
shaft and assemble its attachment in such a 
way that the mass is uniformly distributed 
about its geometric axis.
 (ii) The shaft is subjected to forces such as gear 
forces, belt or chain tensions which result in 
lateral deﬂ ection. This moves the centre of 
mass away from the true axis of rotation that 
passes through the centreline of bearings.
The above two factors cause the mass to 
rotate with small eccentricity about the geometric 
axis. The rotation of the shaft may start about 
the geometric axis. As the speed is increased, 
a centrifugal force acts on the mass due to 
eccentricity. The centrifugal force further increases 
the deﬂ ection of the shaft as well as its eccentricity, 
which in turn increases the centrifugal force itself. 
When the speed is further increased, a stage is 
reached when elastic forces within the shaft no 
longer balance the centrifugal force. This starts 
violent vibrations of the shaft and the speed at 
which this phenomenon occurs is called ‘critical’ 
speed. This is the resonance condition, when the 
speed of rotation is equal to the natural frequency 
of vibrations. The shaft should not be run at the 
critical speed, because excessive deﬂ ection may 
cause failure of the shaft.
There is always damping in the form of internal 
friction and friction in bearings. Therefore, the shaft 
does not fail instantaneously. If the shaft passes 
quickly through the critical speed, no damage 
is done. When the speed of the shaft is further 
increased, i.e., more than the critical speed, a state 
of equilibrium is again reached and the system 
runs virtually about its mass centre. It has been 
observed that high-speed turbines that run above 
the critical speed give a smooth and vibration- 
free performance. The resonance condition can be 
avoided by the following two methods:
 
(i) In some applications, shafts are made very 
rigid with very high critical speed (ncr), 
which is far away from the running speed 
(n). In this case, the shaft never reaches the 
critical speed and no resonance occurs.
 (ii) There are applications where shafts are made 
very slender with very low critical speed (ncr). 
The running speed (n) is two to three times 
of the critical speed. In this case, the shaft 
passes quickly through the critical speed and 
no damage is done. The shaft never reaches 
the critical speed during operating conditions 
and no resonance occurs.
 Critical speed of shafts is a topic of the subject 
‘Mechanical Vibrations’. We will cover only a 
brief treatment of this topic. For any shaft, there 
are a number of critical speeds. The designer is 
mainly interested in the ‘ﬁ rst’ or lowest critical 
speed. Occasionally, the ‘second’ critical speed is 
considered. The other critical speeds are so high that 
they are outside the range of operating speeds. The 
bending conﬁ gurations of the ‘ﬁ rst’ and ‘second’ 
critical speeds are illustrated in Fig. 9.52. In this 
case, a shaft supported between two end bearings 
and having two attached masses is considered.
Fig. 9.52 Critical Speeds of Shaft
 A transmission shaft of negligible mass and 
supported on two end bearings is shown in
Fig. 9.53. It is carrying several concentrated masses. 
The ﬁ rst or lowest critical speed is given by,

where,

g = gravitational constant (9.81 m/s)

m1, m2, m3,… = rotating masses (kg)
d1, d2, d3... = static deﬂ ections at the respective

The above equation is called the Rayleigh–Ritz 
equation. 
Example 9.30 A transmission shaft supported 
between two bearings and carrying two concentrated 
masses is shown in Fig. 9.54. It is made of steel 
(E = 207 000 N/mm2). Assuming that the shaft has 
negligible mass, calculate the critical speed.

Solution
Given E = 207 000 N/mm2 d = 50 mm 
 
 
 
mA = 35 kg mB = 55 kg
Step I Deﬂ ections at mass-A and mass-B
Suppose the masses of 35 and 55 kg are attached to 
the shaft at points A and B respectively.
 
WA = 35g = 35(9.81) = 343.35 N  
 
WB = 55g = 55(9.81) = 539.55 N 
The deﬂ ections at these masses are calculated by 
the method of superimposition. The conﬁ guration 
is similar to Case 7 of Table 9.4 (simply supported 
beam with intermediate load). Rewriting Eqs (27) 
and (28) with reference to Fig. 9.55(a),

10.1 SPRINGS
A spring is deﬁ ned as an elastic machine element, 
which deﬂ ects under the action of the load and 
returns to its original shape when the load is 
removed. It can take any shape and form depending 
upon the application. The important functions and 
applications of springs are as follows:
 
(i) Springs are used to absorb shocks and 
vibrations, e.g., vehicle suspension springs, 
railway buffer springs, buffer springs 
in elevators and vibration mounts for 
machinery.
 
(ii) Springs are used to store energy, e.g., springs 
used in clocks, toys, movie-cameras, circuit 
breakers and starters.
 (iii) Springs are used to measure force, e.g., 
springs used in weighing balances and 
scales.
 (iv) Springs are used to apply force and control 
motion. There are a number of springs used 
for this purpose. In the cam and follower 
mechanism, spring is used to maintain 
contact between the two elements. In engine 
valve mechanism, spring is used to return 
the rocker arm to its normal position when 
the disturbing force is removed. The spring 
used in clutch provides the required force to 
engage the clutch. In all these applications, 
the spring is used either to apply the force or 
to control the motion.
10.2 TYPES OF SPRINGS
Springs are classiﬁ ed according to their shape. The 
shape can be a helical coil of a wire, a piece of 
stamping or a ﬂ at wound-up strip. The most popular 
type of spring is the helical spring. The helical 
spring is made from a wire, usually of circular cross-
section, which is bent in the form of a helix. There 
are two basic types of helical springs—compression 
spring and extension spring as shown in Fig. 10.1. 
In helical compression spring, the external force 
Fig. 10.1 
Helical Springs: (a) Compression Spring
(b) Extension Spring
tends to shorten the spring. In other words, the 
spring is compressed. In helical extension spring, 
the external force tends to lengthen the spring. In 
other words, the spring is elongated. In both the 
394 Design of Machine Elements
cases, the external force acts along the axis of the 
spring and induces torsional shear stress in the 
spring wire. It should be noted that although the 
spring is under compression, the wire of helical 
compression spring is not subjected to compressive 
stress. Also, the wire of helical extension spring is 
not subjected to tensile stress although the spring 
is under tension. In both cases, torsional shear 
stresses are induced in the spring wire. The words 
‘compression’ and ‘extension’ are related to the 
total spring and not the stresses in spring wire.
In helical extension spring, the coils are wound 
tightly together, so that an initial force is required 
before extension begins. The helical springs are 
sometimes classiﬁ ed as closely-coiled helical spring 
and open-coiled helical spring. The difference 
between them is as follows:
 
(i) A helical spring is said to be closely coiled 
spring, when the spring wire is coiled so 
close that the plane containing each coil is 
almost at right angles to the axis of the helix. 
In other words, the helix angle is very small. 
It is usually less than 10°.
 
(ii) A helical spring is said to be open-coiled 
spring, when the spring wire is coiled in 
such a way, that there is large gap between 
adjacent coils. In other words, the helix 
angle is large. It is usually more than 10°.
There are few applications of open-coiled 
helical springs compared with closely-coiled helical 
springs. The analysis in this chapter is restricted 
to closely coiled-helical springs (CCHS). Helical 
springs, compression as well as extension, have the 
following advantages:
 
(i) They are easy to manufacture.
 
(ii) They are cheaper than other types of 
springs.
 (iii) Their reliability is high.
 (iv) The deﬂ ection of the spring is linearly 
proportional to the force acting on the 
spring.
It is due to the above advantages that helical 
springs are popular and extensively used in a number 
of applications.
A helical torsion spring is shown in Fig. 10.2. 
The construction of this spring is similar to that of 
compression or extension spring, except that the ends 
are formed in such a way that the spring is loaded by 
a torque about the axis of the coils. Helical torsion 
spring is used to transmit torque to a particular 
component in the machine or the mechanism. For 
example, the spring shown in Fig. 10.2 transmits 
a torque of (P ¥ r). Helical torsion spring is used 
in door-hinges, brush holders, automobile starters 
and door locks. The helical torsion spring resists the 
bending moment (P ¥ r), which tends to wind up 
the spring. The bending moment induces bending 
stresses in the spring wire. The term ‘torsion 
spring’ is somewhat misleading because the wire is 
subjected to bending stresses, unlike torsional shear 
stresses induced in helical compression or extension 
springs. It should be noted that although the spring 
is subjected to torsional moment, the wire of a 
helical torsion spring is not subjected to torsional 
shear stress. It is subjected to bending stresses.
Fig. 10.2 Helical Torsion Spring
A multi-leaf or laminated spring consists of a 
series of ﬂ at plates, usually of semi-elliptical shape 
as shown in Fig. 10.3. The ﬂ at plates, called leaves, 
Fig. 10.3 Semi-elliptic Leaf Spring
have varying lengths. The leaves are held together 
by means of U-bolts and a centre clip. The longest 
Springs 395
leaf, called the master leaf, is bent at the two ends to 
form spring eyes. The leaves of multi-leaf spring are 
subjected to bending stresses. Multi-leaf springs are 
widely used in automobile and railroad suspensions. 
In addition to the above mentioned types of 
springs, there are other springs such as helical 
springs of rectangular cross-section, spiral torsion 
springs, disk or belleville springs and volute springs. 
The discussion in this chapter is mainly restricted to 
helical springs and leaf springs.
10.3 TERMINOLOGY OF HELICAL 
SPRINGS
The main dimensions of a helical spring subjected 
to compressive force are shown in Fig. 10.4. They 
are as follows:
 d = wire diameter of spring (mm)
 Di = inside diameter of spring coil (mm) 
 Do = outside diameter of spring coil (mm)
 D = mean coil diameter (mm)
Therefore,
 
D
D

 (10.1)
Fig. 10.4 Dimensions of Spring
There is an important parameter in spring design 
called spring index. It is denoted by the letter C. 
The spring index is deﬁ ned as the ratio of mean coil 
diameter to wire diameter. Or,
 
C
D
d
=
 
 (10.2)
In the design of helical springs, the designer 
should use good judgement in assuming the value 
of the spring index C. The spring index indicates the 
relative sharpness of the curvature of the coil. A low 
spring index means high sharpness of curvature. 
When the spring index is low (C < 3), the actual 
stresses in the wire are excessive due to curvature 
effect. Such a spring is difﬁ cult to manufacture and 
special care in coiling is required to avoid cracking 
in some wires. When the spring index is high
(C > 15), it results in large variation in the coil 
diameter. Such a spring is prone to buckling and 
also tangles easily during handling. A spring index 
from 4 to 12 is considered best from manufacturing 
considerations. Therefore, in practical applications, 
the spring index usually varies from 4 to 12. 
However, a spring index in the range of 6 to 9 is still 
preferred particularly for close tolerance springs and 
those subjected to cyclic loading.
There are three terms—free length, compressed 
length and solid length, which are illustrated in
Fig. 10.5. These terms are related to helical 
compression spring. These lengths are determined 
by the following way:
(i) Solid Length Solid length is deﬁ ned as the axial 
length of the spring which is so compressed that the 
adjacent coils touch each other. In this case, the spring 
is completely compressed and no further compression 
is possible. The solid length is given by,
Solid length = Nt d
where,
Nt = total number of coils
(ii) Compressed Length Compressed length is 
deﬁ ned as the axial length of the spring, which is 
subjected to maximum compressive force. In this 
case, the spring is subjected to maximum deﬂ ection 
δ. When the spring is subjected to maximum force, 
there should be some gap or clearance between 
the adjacent coils. The gap is essential to prevent 
clashing of the coils. The clashing allowance or 
the total axial gap is usually taken as 15% of the 
maximum deﬂ ection. Sometimes, an arbitrary 
decision is taken and it is assumed that there is a 
gap of 1 or 2 mm between adjacent coils under 
maximum load condition. In this case, the total axial 
gap is given by, 
 Total gap = (Nt – 1) ¥ Gap between adjacent coils
396 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 10.5 Spring Length Terminology
(iii) Free Length Free length is deﬁ ned as the axial 
length of an unloaded helical compression spring. In 
this case, no external force acts on the spring. Free 
length is an important dimension in spring design 
and manufacture. It is the length of the spring in free 
condition prior to assembly. Free length is given 
by,
 free length = compressed length + δ
 
= solid length + total axial gap + δ
The pitch of the coil is deﬁ ned as the axial 
distance between adjacent coils in uncompressed 
state of spring. It is denoted by p. It is given by,
 
  p = free length
(
)
Nt -1
The stiffness of the spring (k) is deﬁ ned as the force 
required to produce unit deﬂ ection. Therefore,
 
  k = P
d  
(10.3)
where,
k = stiffness of the spring (N/mm)
P = axial spring force (N)
d = axial deﬂ ection of the spring corresponding 
 
to the force P (mm)
There are various names for stiffness of spring such 
as rate of spring, gradient of spring, scale of spring 
or simply spring constant. The stiffness of spring 
represents the slope of the load-deﬂ ection line.
There are two terms related to the spring coils, 
viz., active coils and inactive coils. Active coils are 
the coils in the spring which contribute to spring 
action, support the external force and deﬂ ect under 
the action of force. A portion of the end coils, which 
is in contact with the seat, does not contribute to 
spring action and are called inactive coils. These 
coils do not support the load and do not deﬂ ect 
under the action of an external force. The number of 
inactive coils is given by,
 
inactive coils = Nt – N
where,
 
N = number of active coils.
10.4 STYLES OF END
There are four common methods which are used in 
forming the ends of the helical compression spring 
as shown in Fig. 10.6—plain ends, plain and ground 
ends, square ends and square and ground ends. The 
turns at the two ends do not affect the deﬂ ection 
calculated by the load-deﬂ ection equation. Therefore, 
while calculating the number of active turns, the end 
turns should be subtracted from the total number of 
turns. The number of active turns for different styles 
of end is as follows:

Fig. 10.6 End Styles of Helical Compression Springs
The different styles of end for the helical 
extension spring are shown in Fig. 10.7. The end 
should be designed in such a way that the stress 
concentration at the bend is minimum. Sometimes 
the effect of stress concentration in ends is so severe 
that the spring body becomes stronger than the 
end and failure occurs in the end coils. For helical 
extension ends, all coils are active coils. The number 
of active coils (N) is the same as the total number of 
coils (Nt).

10.5 STRESS AND DEFLECTION  
 
 EQUATIONS
There are two basic equations for the design 
of helical springs, viz., load-stress equation 
and load-deflection equation. A helical spring 
made from the wire of circular cross-section 
is shown in Fig. 10.8(a). D and d are the mean 
coil diameter and wire diameter respectively. 
The number of active coils in this spring is 
N. The spring is subjected to an axial force P. 
When the wire of the helical spring is uncoiled 
and straightened, it takes the shape of a bar as 
shown in Fig. 10.8(b). In deriving the stress 
equation, this bar is considered to be equivalent 
to the actual helical spring. The dimensions of 
equivalent bar are as follows:
 
(i) The diameter of the bar is equal to the wire 
diameter of the spring (d).
Fig. 10.8 (a) Helical Spring (b) Helical Spring-unbent
398 Design of Machine Elements
 
(ii) The length of one coil in the spring is (pD). 
There are N such active coils. Therefore, the 
length of equivalent bar is (pDN).
 (iii) The bar is ﬁ tted with a bracket at each end. 
The length of this bracket is equal to mean 
coil radius of the spring (D/2).
The force P acting at the end of the bracket 
induces torsional shear stress in the bar. The torsional 
moment Mt is given by,

When the equivalent bar is bent in the form of 
helical coil, there are additional stresses on account 
of following two factors:
 
(i) There is direct or transverse shear stress in 
the spring wire.
 
(ii) When the bar is bent in the form of coil, the 
length of the inside ﬁ bre is less than the length 
of the outside ﬁ bre. This results in stress 
concentration at the inside ﬁ bre of the coil.
The resultant stress consists of superimposition 
of torsional shear stress, direct shear stress and 
additional stresses due to the curvature of the coil. 
The stresses in the spring wire on account of these 
factors are shown in Fig. 10.9. 
Fig. 10.9 Stresses in Spring Wire: (a) Pure Torsional 
Stress (b) Direct Shear Stress (c) Combined 
Torsional, Direct and Curvature Shear Stresses
Equation (a) does not take into consideration the 
effect of direct shear stress and stress concentration 
due to curvature effect. It requires modiﬁ cation. We 
will assume the following two factors to account for 
these effects:
KS = factor to account for direct shear stress
Kc = factor to account for stress concentration  
 
due to curvature effect
The combined effect of these two factors is
given by,
 
 K = KS KC  
 (10.4)
where K is the factor to account for the combined 
effect of two factors.

The Wahl factor provides a simple method to ﬁ nd 
out resultant stresses in the spring. As shown in Fig. 
10.9(c), the resultant shear stress is maximum at the 
inside radius of the coil.
 In normal applications, the spring is designed by 
using the Wahl factor. When the spring is subjected 
to ﬂ uctuating stresses, two factors Ks and Kc are 
separately used.

(k) will be double when N becomes (N/2).
It is observed from Eq. (10.8) that for a given 
spring,
 
d µ P
or

The load is linearly proportional to the deﬂ ection 
of the spring. The load-deﬂ ection curve for helical 
spring is shown in Fig. 10.11. The area below the 
load-deﬂ ection line gives the strain energy stored 
in the spring. Assuming that the load is gradually 
applied, the energy stored in the spring is given by,

10.6 SERIES AND PARALLEL  
 
 CONNECTIONS
There are two types of spring connections—series 
and parallel. The objectives of series and parallel 
combinations are as follows:
400 Design of Machine Elements
 
(i) to save the space;
 
(ii) to change the rate of the spring at a certain 
deﬂ ection; and
 (iii) to provide a fail-safe system.
Figure 10.12 shows two springs, with spring 
rates k1 and k2, connected in series. For series 
connection,
 
(i) The force acting on each spring is same and 
equal to the external force
 
(ii) The total deﬂ ection of the spring combination 
is equal to the sum of the deﬂ ections of 
individual springs

Figure 10.13 shows two springs, with spring 
rates k1 and k2, connected in parallel. For parallel 
connection,
 
(i) The force acting on the spring combination 
is equal to the sum of forces acting on 
individual springs
 
(ii) The deﬂ ection of individual springs is 
same and equal to the deﬂ ection of the 
combination

Therefore,
 
 P = P1 + P2

From Eq. (10.3),
 
 P = kd
or 
 P1 = k1d  and  P2 = k2d

From Eqs (c) and (d),
 
 kd = k1d + k2d
or 
k = k1 + k2 + … 
  (10.12)
where k is the combined stiffness of all springs in 
the connection.
It is observed that deﬂ ections are additive in a 
series combination, while forces are additive in 
a parallel combination. Using this principle, the 
individual springs can be designed.

10.7 SPRING MATERIALS
The selection of material for the spring wire depends 
upon the following factors:
 
(i) The load acting on the spring
 
(ii)  The range of stress through which the spring 
operates
 (iii) The limitations on mass and volume of 
spring
 (iv) The expected fatigue life
 
(v) The environmental conditions in which the 
spring will operate such as temperature and 
corrosive atmosphere
 (vi) The severity of deformation encountered 
while making the spring. 
There are four basic varieties of steel wire 
which are used in springs in the majority of appli-
cations2, 3, 4:
 
(i) patented 
and 
cold-drawn 
steel 
wires 
(unalloyed);
 
(ii) oil-hardened and tempered spring steel wires 
and valve spring wires;
 (iii) oil-hardened and tempered steel wires 
(alloyed); and
 (iv) stainless steel spring wires.
The most extensively used spring material is 
high-carbon hard-drawn spring steel. It is often 
called ‘patented and cold-drawn’ steel wire. There 
are two important terms related to patented and 
cold-drawn steel wires, namely, ‘patenting’ and 
‘cold drawing’. Patenting is deﬁ ned as heating the 
steel to above the critical range followed by rapid 
cooling to transform at an elevated temperature 
from 455° to 465°C. This operation produces a 
tough uniform structure that is suitable for severe 
cold drawing. After this operation, the spring wire 
is produced from hot rolled rods by cold drawing 
through carbide dies to obtain the required diameter. 
The patented and cold drawn steel wires are made of 
high carbon steel and contain 0.85–0.95% carbon. It 
is considered an aristocrat among springs because 
it has high tensile strength, high elastic limit and 
the ability to withstand high stresses under repeated 
loadings. The patented and cold-drawn steel wires 
are the least expensive of all spring materials. The 
music spring wire is the highest quality of hard-
drawn steel spring. The name ‘music wire’ is derived 
from the popular ‘piano’ wire that was originally 
used in musical instruments.
The patented and cold-drawn steel wires are 
mainly used in springs subjected to static forces and 
moderate ﬂ uctuating forces. There are four grades 
of this wire. Grade-1 is used in springs subjected to 
static or low-load cycles. Grade-2 is used in springs 
subjected to moderate-load cycles. Grade-3 is used 
in highly stressed static springs or springs subjected 
to moderate dynamic loads. Grade-4 is suitable for 
springs subjected to severe stresses. The tensile 
strengths of these wires are given in Table 10.1. 
The modulus of rigidity (G) of these wires is 81370 
N/mm2.
The second group of spring wires is unalloyed oil-
hardened and tempered spring steel wires and valve 
spring wires. Oil-hardened and tempered spring 
steel wires contain 0.55–0.75% carbon. The wire is 
cold drawn and then hardened and tempered. A valve 
spring wire contains 0.60–0.75% carbon. It is the 
highest quality of oil-hardened and tempered steel 
wire. It has excellent surface ﬁ nish and considered 
to be most reliable for applications involving 
ﬂ uctuating forces. It is used for applications where 
the stresses are severe.
There are two grades of unalloyed, oil-hardened 
and tempered spring steel wire and valve spring wire, 
viz., SW and VW. Grade SW is suitable for springs 
subjected to moderate ﬂ uctuating stresses, whereas 
Grade VW is recommended when the spring is 
subjected to a high magnitude of ﬂ uctuating stresses. 
The tensile strengths of these wires are given in 
Table 10.2. The modulus of rigidity (G) is 81370 
N/mm2. The limiting temperatures for SW and VW 
grade wires are 100° and 80°C respectively.

There are two popular varieties of alloy steel 
wires, namely, chromium–vanadium steel and 
chromium–silicon 
steel. 
Chromium–vanadium 
steel contains 0.48–0.53% carbon, 0.80–1.10% 
chromium and 0.15% vanadium. These wires are 
used for applications involving higher stresses and 
for springs subjected to impact or shock loads, such 
as in pneumatic hammers. Chromium–silicon spring 
steel is new compared with other spring steels and 
it was originally developed for recoil springs in 
aircraft guns and for control springs in torpedos in 
England. Chromium–silicon steel contains 0.51–
0.59% carbon, 0.60–0.80% chromium and 1.2–
1.6% silicon. These wires are used for applications 
involving highly stressed springs subjected to shock 
or impact loading. Alloy steel wires are superior 
to carbon steel wires. However, the cost is their 
limiting factor. Stainless steel springs, which exhibit 
an excellent corrosion resistance, are ideal to work 
in steam or other corrosive media.

Springs are made either by hot-working or by 
cold-working processes, depending upon wire 
diameter, spring index and desirable properties. 
Winding of spring wire induces residual stresses 
due to bending. Very often, the spring is given a 
mild heat treatment after winding to relieve residual 
stresses. Cold formed springs are wound to a smaller 
diameter than the desired size because of spring back 
Springs 403
or expansion that occurs after coiling. Springs made 
of small diameter wires are wound cold. However, 
helical springs made of 6 mm diameter bar or larger 
are usually hot wound to avoid the high residual 
stresses that are induced by cold forming.
There are non-ferrous materials, such as spring 
brass, phosphor bronze, silicon–bronze, monel and 
beryllium–copper, which are also used in spring 
wires. The discussion in this chapter is restricted to 
springs made of steel wires.
10.8 DESIGN OF HELICAL SPRINGS
There are three objectives for the design of the 
helical spring. They are as follows:
 
(i) It should possess sufﬁ cient strength to 
withstand the external load.
 
(ii) It should have the required load-deﬂ ection 
characteristic.
 (iii) It should not buckle under the external load.
It is possible to design a number of springs for 
a given application by changing the three basic 
parameters, viz., wire diameter, mean coil diameter 
and the number of active turns. However, there are 
practical limitations on these parameters. In certain 
applications, there are space limitations, e.g., the 
spring is to ﬁ t in a hole of certain diameter, where 
the outside coil diameter (Do) is restricted. In some 
applications, the spring is to ﬁ t over a rod, where 
the minimum inside diameter (Di) of the coil is 
speciﬁ ed. Before proceeding to design calculations, 
the designer should specify the limits on these 
diameters.
 The main dimensions to be calculated in the 
spring design are wire diameter, mean coil diameter 
and the number of active coils. The ﬁ rst two are 
calculated by the load-stress equation, while the 
third is calculated by the load-deﬂ ection equation. It 
is convenient to use the load-stress equation, which 
contains spring index as a parameter.

Factor of Safety The factor of safety in the 
design of springs is usually 1.5 or less. The use of 
a relatively low factor of safety is justiﬁ ed on the 
following grounds:
 
(i) In most of the applications, springs operate 
with well deﬁ ned deﬂ ections. Therefore, the 
forces acting on the spring and corresponding 
stresses can be precisely calculated. It is not 
necessary to take higher factor of safety to 
account for uncertainty in external forces 
acting on the spring.
 
(ii) In case of helical compression springs, 
an overload will simply close up the gaps 
between coils without a dangerous increase 
in deﬂ ection and stresses.
 (iii) In case of helical extension springs, usually 
overload stops are provided to prevent 
excessive deﬂ ection and stresses.
 (iv) The spring material is carefully controlled 
at all stages of manufacturing. The thin and 
uniform wire cross-section permits uniform 
heat treatment and cold working of the entire 
spring.
Therefore, the factor of safety based on torsional 
yield strength (Ssy) is taken as 1.5 for the springs that 
are subjected to static force.

 (10.14)
The permissible shear stress is, therefore, 30% 
of the ultimate tensile strength of the spring wire. 
The Indian Standard 4454–1981 has recommended 
a much higher value for the permissible shear stress. 
According to this standard,
 
t = 0.5 Sut 
  (10.15)
This is due to higher tensile yield strengths 
exhibited by the spring wires. In design of helical 
404 Design of Machine Elements
springs, the permissible shear stress (t) is taken from 
30% to 50% of the ultimate tensile strength (Sut).
The basic procedure for the design of helical 
spring consists of the following steps: 
 
(i) For 
the 
given 
application, 
estimate 
the maximum spring force (P) and the 
corresponding required deﬂ ection (d) of 
the spring. In some cases, maximum spring 
force (P) and stiffness k, which is (P/d), are 
speciﬁ ed.
 
(ii) Select a suitable spring material and ﬁ nd out 
ultimate tensile strength (Sut) from the data. 
Calculate the permissible shear stress for the 
spring wire by following relationship:
 
t = 0.30 Sut or 0.50 Sut
 (iii) Assume a suitable value for the spring index 
(C). For industrial applications, the spring 
index varies from 8 to 10. A spring index of 
8 is considered as a good value. The spring 
index for springs in valves and clutches is
5. The spring index should never be less
than 3.

 (xv) Prepare a list of spring speciﬁ cations.
 A helical compression spring that is too long 
compared to the mean coil diameter, acts as a 
ﬂ exible column and may buckle at a comparatively 
low axial force. The spring should be preferably 
designed as buckle-proof. Compression springs, 
which cannot be designed buckle-proof, must be 
guided in a sleeve or over an arbor. The thumb rules 
for provision of guide are as follows:
free length

However, provision of guide results in friction 
between the spring and the guide and this may 
damage the spring in the long run.

10.9 SPRING DESIGN—TRIAL AND  
ERROR METHOD
In practice, helical springs are designed by trial and 
error method. The basic procedure of spring design 
explained in the previous article is based on the 
assumption that the value of tensile strength for a 
given grade of spring wire is constant. However, it 
is observed from Table 10.1 and 10.2 that tensile 
strength of the material is not constant, but it varies 
with wire diameter. Let us consider Grade-1 of 
patented and cold-drawn steel wire. From Table 
10.1, the values of tensile strength for various wire 
diameters are as follows:
Wire diameter (mm)

3.0
1320
4.0
1250
5.0
1190

It is observed from the above values that tensile 
strength decreases as wire diameter increases. 
Therefore, tensile strength is inversely proportion to 
wire diameter.

From expressions (c) and (e), it is observed that 
permissible stress is inversely proportional to (1/d), 
while induced stress is proportional to (1/d2). Both 
stresses depend upon wire diameter. Such problems 
can be solved only by trial and error of  Eqs (b) and 
(d). The trial and error procedure consists of the 
following steps:
 
(i) Assume some wire diameter (d).
 
(ii) Find out the corresponding tensile strength 
from Table 10.1 or 10.2 and using this value 
ﬁ nd out permissible stress by Eq. (b).
 (iii) Find out induced stress by Eq. (d).
 (iv) Check up whether permissible stress is more 
than induced stress. If not, increase the wire 
diameter and repeat the above steps.
 
(v) The above mentioned procedure is repeated 
till the value of induced stress comes out to 
be less than permissible stress.
10.10 DESIGN AGAINST FLUCTUATING 
LOAD
In many applications, the force acting on the spring is 
not constant but varies in magnitude with time. The 
valve spring of an automotive engine is subjected to 
millions of stress cycles during its lifetime. On the 
other hand, the springs in linkages and mechanisms 
are subjected to comparatively less number of stress 
cycles. The springs subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses 
are designed on the basis of two criteria—design for 
inﬁ nite life and design for ﬁ nite life.
Let us consider a spring subjected to an external 
ﬂ uctuating force, which changes its magnitude from 
Pmax. to Pmin. in the load cycle. The mean force Pm 
and the force amplitude Pa are given by,

where K is the Wahl factor, which takes into

as of stress concentration due to curvature.
There is a basic difference between the rotating-
beam specimen and fatigue testing of spring wires. 
A spring is never subjected to a completely reversed 
load, changing its magnitude from tension to 
compression and passing through zero with respect 
to time. A helical compression spring is subjected 
to purely compressive forces. On the other hand, a 
helical extension spring is subjected to purely tensile 
forces. In general, the spring wires are subjected to 
pulsating shear stresses, which vary from zero to 
(S¢se) as shown in Fig. 10.14. (S¢se) is the endurance 
limit in shear for the stress variation from zero to 
some maximum value. The data regarding the
Fig. 10.14 Pulsating Stress Cycle
experimental values of endurance strength of spring 
wires is not readily available. In absence of such 
values, the following relationships suggested by HJ 
Elmendorf 5 can be used. 
For Patented and cold-drawn steel wires
(Grade-1 to 4),
 
S¢se = 0.21 Sut
 
Ssy = 0.42 Sut 
  (10.20)
For oil-hardened and tempered steel wires (SW 
and VW grade),
 
S¢se = 0.22 Sut
 
Ssy = 0.45 Sut 
 (10.21)
where Sut is the ultimate tensile strength. 
The fatigue diagram for the spring is shown in
Fig. 10.15. The mean stress (tm) is plotted on the 
abscissa, while the stress amplitude (ta) on the 
ordinate. Point A with coordinates

indicates the failure-point of the spring wire in 
fatigue test with pulsating stress cycle. Point B 
on the abscissa indicates the failure under static 
condition, when the mean stress (tm) reaches the 
torsional yield strength (Ssy). Therefore, line AB is 
called the line of failure.

The line DC is parallel to the line BA. Any point 
on the line CD, such as X, represents a stress situation 
with the same factor of safety. Line CD is called the 
design line because it is used to ﬁ nd out permissible 
stresses with a particular factor of safety.
The line GH is called load line. It is drawn from 
the point G on the abscissa at a distance ti from 
the origin. The torsional shear stress due to initial

Examples based on Simple Analysis
Example 10.1  It is required to design a helical 
compression spring subjected to a maximum force of 
1250 N. The deﬂ ection of the spring corresponding 
to the maximum force should be approximately 30 
mm. The spring index can be taken as 6. The spring 
is made of patented and cold-drawn steel wire. The 
ultimate tensile strength and modulus of rigidity of 
the spring material are 1090 and 81 370 N/mm2 
respectively. The permissible shear stress for the 
spring wire should be taken as 50% of the ultimate 
tensile strength. Design the spring and calculate:
 
(i) wire diameter;
 
(ii) mean coil diameter;
 (iii) number of active coils;
 (iv) total number of coils;
 
(v) free length of the spring; and
 (vi) pitch of the coil.

Example 10.4 It is required to design a helical 
compression spring for the valve mechanism. The 
axial force acting on the spring is 300 N when the 
valve is open and 150 N when the valve is closed. 
The length of the spring is 30 mm when the valve 
is open and 35 mm when the valve is closed. The 
spring is made of oil-hardened and tempered valve 
spring wire and the ultimate tensile strength is 1370 
N/mm2. The permissible shear stress for the spring 
wire should be taken as 30% of the ultimate tensile 
strength. The modulus of rigidity is 81 370 N/mm2.
The spring is to be ﬁ tted over a valve rod and 
the minimum inside diameter of the spring should be
20 mm. Design the spring and calculate
 
(i) wire diameter;
 
(ii) mean coil diameter;
 (iii) number of active coils;

Assume that the clearance between adjacent coils

the maximum load.
Solution

neglect the effect of the Wahl factor K or substitute

Example 10.5  A helical tension spring is used in 
the spring balance to measure the weights. One end 
of the spring is attached to the rigid support while 
the other end, which is free, carries the weights to 
be measured. The maximum weight attached to the 
spring balance is 1500 N and the length of the scale 
should be approximately 100 mm. The spring index 
can be taken as 6. The spring is made of oil-hardened 
and tempered steel wire with ultimate tensile 
strength of 1360 N/mm2 and modulus of rigidity of 81 
370 N/mm2. The permissible shear stress in the spring 
wire should be taken as 50% of the ultimate tensile 
strength. Design the spring and calculate 
 
(i) wire diameter;
 
(ii)  mean coil diameter;
 (iii) number of active coils;
 (iv) required spring rate; and
 
(v) actual spring rate.
Solution
Given P = 1500 N C = 6 Sut = 1360 N/mm2
 
G = 81 370 N/mm2 t = 0.5 Sut
Step I Wire Diameter
The working principle of the spring balance is 
illustrated in Fig. 10.18. As the load acting on the 
spring varies from 0 to 1500 N, the pointer attached 
to the free end of the spring moves over a scale 
between highest and lowest positions. The length of 
the scale between these two positions of the pointer 
is 100 mm. In other words, the spring deﬂ ection is 
100 mm when the force is 1500 N.

Example 10.6 A railway wagon moving at a 
velocity of 1.5 m/s is brought to rest by a bumper 
consisting of two helical springs arranged in 
parallel. The mass of the wagon is 1500 kg. The 
springs are compressed by 150 mm in bringing the 
wagon to rest. The spring index can be taken as 6. 
The springs are made of oil-hardened and tempered 
steel wire with ultimate tensile strength of 1250 
N/mm2 and modulus of rigidity of 81 370 N/mm2. 
The permissible shear stress for the spring wire can 
be taken as 50% of the ultimate tensile strength.

consists of two pairs of friction surfaces, one between 
the friction lining and the pressure plate and the 
other between the friction lining and the ﬂ ywheel 
as shown in Fig 10.19. Eight identical helical 
compression springs, arranged in parallel, provide 
the required axial thrust on the friction surface. The 
total spring force exerted by all springs is 2400 N 
and the corresponding deﬂ ection of each spring 
is approximately 15 mm. The spring index can be 
taken as 8. The springs are made of patented and 
cold-drawn steel wire with ultimate tensile strength 
of 1390 N/mm2 and modulus of rigidity of 81 370

helical tension spring through the lever mechanism 
is schematically illustrated in Fig. 10.20. The 
diameter of the valve is 50 mm. In normal operating 
conditions, the valve is closed and the pressure inside 
the chamber is 0.5 N/mm2. The valve is opened when 
the pressure inside the chamber increases to 0.6 
N/mm2. The maximum lift of the valve is 5 mm. The 
spring index can be taken as 8. The spring is made 
of patented and cold-drawn steel wire with ultimate 
tensile strength of 1200 N/mm2 and modulus of 
rigidity of 81 370 N/mm2. The permissible shear 
stress for the spring wire can be taken as 30% of 
the ultimate tensile strength. Design the spring and 
calculate:
 
(i) wire diameter;
 
(ii) mean coil diameter; and
 (iii) number of active coils.

Example 10.10  A helical compression spring is 
used to absorb the shock. The initial compression 
of the spring is 30 mm and it is further compressed 
by 50 mm while absorbing the shock. The spring is 
to absorb 250 J of energy during the process. The 
spring index can be taken as 6. The spring is made of 
patented and cold-drawn steel wire with an ultimate 
tensile strength of 1500 N/mm2 and modulus of 
rigidity of 81 370 N/mm2. The permissible shear 
stress for the spring wire should be taken as 30% of 
the ultimate tensile strength. Design the spring and 
calculate:
 
(i) wire diameter;
 
(ii) mean coil diameter;
 (iii) number of active turns;
 (iv) free length; and 
 
(v) pitch of the turns.
Solution
Given  C = 6 d1 = 30 mm d2 = (30 + 50) mm
E = 250 J Sut = 1500 N/mm2 G = 81 370 N mm2

Suppose P1 and d1 denote initial spring force and 
deﬂ ection respectively before the shock.
 d1 = 30 mm
 P1 = k d = (30 k) N
where k is the stiffness of the spring. 
Suppose P2 and d2 denote spring force and 
deﬂ ection respectively after absorbing shock.

Procedure
Example 10.11 An 
automotive 
single-plate 
clutch, with two pairs of friction surfaces, transmits 
300 N-m torque at 1500 rpm. The inner and outer 
diameters of the friction disk are 170 and 270 mm 
respectively. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.35. The 
Springs 417
normal force on the friction surfaces is exerted by 
nine helical compression springs, so that the clutch 
is always engaged. The clutch is disengaged when 
the external force further compresses the springs. 
The spring index is 5 and the number of active coils 
is 6. The springs are made of patented and cold-
drawn steel wires of Grade 2. (G = 81 370 N/mm2). 
The permissible shear stress for the spring wire is 
30% of the ultimate tensile strength. Design the 
springs and specify their dimensions.
Solution
Given C = 5  N = 6  G = 81 370 N/mm2
t = 0.3 Sut  number of springs = 9
For clutch,  Mt = 300 N-m  n = 1500 rpm 
number of friction surfaces = 2
For friction disk,  D = 270 mm d = 170 mm 
m = 0.35
Step I Maximum spring force
The construction of the clutch mechanism is 
illustrated in Fig. 10.19 of Example No. 10.7. There 
are two pairs of contacting surfaces and the torque 
transmitted by each pair is (300/2), or 150 N-m. 
Assuming uniform-wear theory (Chapter 11), the 
total normal force P1 required to transmit the torque 
is given by Eq. (11.8), i.e.,

Example 10.12 A direct reading tension spring 
balance consists of a helical tension spring, which 
is attached to a rigid support at one end and carries 
masses at the other free end. The pointer attached to 
the free end moves on a scale and indicates the mass. 
The length of the scale is 100 mm, which is divided 
into 50 equal divisions. Each division on the scale 
indicates 0.5 kg. The maximum capacity of the spring 
balance is 25 kg. The spring index is 6. The spring 
is made of an oil-hardened and tempered steel wire 
of Grade-SW (G = 81 370 N/mm2). The permissible 
shear stress in the spring wire is recommended as 
50% of the ultimate tensile strength. Design the

Example 10.14 An eccentric cam, 100 mm in 
diameter, rotates with an eccentricity of 10 mm as 
shown in Fig. 10.21. The roller follower is held 
against the cam by means of a helical compression 
spring. The force between the cam and the follower 
varies from 100 N at the lowest position to 350 N at 
the highest position of the follower. The permissible 
shear stress in the spring wire is recommended as 
30% of the ultimate tensile strength. Design the 
spring from static considera tions and determine the 
factor of safety against ﬂ uctuating stresses. Neglect 
the effect of inertia forces.
Fig. 10.21 Cam Mechanism
Solution
Given Pmax. = 350 N Pmin. = 100 N
 
e = 10 mm t = 0.3 Sut
Step I Design against static load
The spring is subjected to a ﬂ uc tuating force. 
Therefore, the oil-hardened and tempered steel wire 
of SW grade is selected for this application. The 
spring index is assumed as 6.

the wire diameter is increased to 5 mm.

In Section 10.8 on ‘Design of Helical Springs’,

design is usually 1.5 or less on account of four 
factors. Therefore, the factor of safety of 1.46 in the 
above application is reasonable.

422 Design of Machine Elements
Example 10.15 The constructional details of 
an exhaust valve of a diesel engine are shown in
Fig. 10.22. The diameter of the valve is 32 mm and 
the suction pressure in the cylinder is 0.03 N/mm2. 
The mass of the valve is 50 g. The maximum valve 
lift is 10 mm. The stiffness of the spring for the valve 
is 10 N/mm. The spring index can be assumed as 8. 
The permissible shear stress in the spring wire is 
recommended as 30% of the ultimate tensile strength. 
Neglecting the effect of inertia forces, design the 
spring for static considerations and determine the 
factor of safety against ﬂ uctuating stresses.
Fig. 10.22 Valve Operating Mechanism
Solution
Given k = 10 N/mm C = 8 t = 0.3 Sut
Step I Maximum spring force
The spring is subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses. 
Therefore, oil-hardened and tempered valve spring 
wire of Grade-VW is selected for this application. 
Initially, the spring is ﬁ tted with a pre-load. The 
initial pre-load should be sufﬁ cient to hold the valve 
on its seat against the negative pressure inside the 
cylinder during the suction stroke. Since the cylinder 
is vertical, additional pre-load should be provided to 
account for the weight of the valve.

 Weight of the valve = mg = (0.05)(9.81) = 0.49 N
 Minimum pre-load = 24.13 + 0.49 = 24.62 N
To be on the safer side, the initial pre-load is 
taken as 30 N. During the exhaust stroke, the spring 
is further compressed by 10 mm (valve-lift). The 
maximum force acting on the spring is given by
Pmax. = Pmin. + kd = 30 + 10(10) = 130 N

424 Design of Machine Elements
 
p1 = 0.35 N / mm2 
 
p2 = 0.25 N / mm2
This is the normal operating condition of the 
valve. The spring is to be ﬁ tted in a cylindrical 
space of 25 mm diameter. There is no restriction on 
the free length of the spring. The permissible shear 
stress in the spring wire is recommended as 30% of 
the ultimate tensile strength. Design the spring from 
static considerations and determine the factor of 
safety against ﬂ uctuating stresses. Neglect the effect 
of inertia forces.
Solution
Given Dmax. = 25 mm t = 0.3 Sut
Step I Maximum spring force
The spring is subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses. 
Therefore, an oil-hardened and tempered valve 
spring wire of Grade-VW is selected for this 
application. The spring index for such applications 
varies from 6 to 8. Since there is restriction on the 
maximum coil diameter, a low value of 5 is selected 
as the spring index.
The spring force is minimum when the plunger 
does not move through 10 mm.
 
Pmin. = initial pre-load = 100 N 
The spring force is maximum when the plunger 
moves through 10 mm. The maximum spring force 
consists of initial pre-load and additional spring 
forces.

From Table 10.2,

Therefore, t < td
The design is satisfactory and the wire diameter 
should be 3 mm. However, the spring is subjected to 
ﬂ uctuating stresses and to account for these stresses, 
the wire diameter is increased to 3.6 mm.
 d = 3.6 mm
 D = Cd = 5(3.6) = 18 mm
 Dmax. = D + d = 18 + 3.6 = 21.6 mm 
The outer diameter of the spring is 21.6 mm, 
leaving sufﬁ cient margin for diametral expansion. 
The spring can be easily ﬁ tted in a cylindrical space 
of 25 mm diameter.

10.11 CONCENTRIC SPRINGS
A concentric spring consists of two helical 
compression springs, one inside the other, having 
the same axis. It is shown in Fig. 10.24. Concentric 
spring is also called a ‘nested’ spring. In general, there 
are two springs. However, in certain applications, 
concentric spring consists of three coaxial springs, 
namely inner, middle and outer springs. Two springs 
shown in Fig. 10.24 have opposite hand of helices. 
If the outer spring has a right-hand helix, the inner 
spring always has a left-hand helix and vice versa. 
426 Design of Machine Elements
Adjacent springs having opposite hands, prevent the 
locking of coils, in the event of axial misalignment 
or buckling of springs. Concentric spring has the 
following advantages:
 
(i) Since there are two springs, the load carrying 
capacity is increased and heavy load can be 
transmitted in a restricted space.
 
(ii) In concentric spring, the operation of the 
mechanism continues even if one of the springs 
breaks. This results in ‘fail safe’ system.
 (iii) In concentric spring, the spring vibrations 
called ‘surge’, are eliminated.
Fig. 10.24 Concentric Springs
Concentric springs are used as valve springs 
in heavy duty diesel engines, aircraft engines and 
railroad suspensions.
In some applications, concentric spring is used 
to obtain a spring force, which is not directly 
proportional to its deﬂ ection. Such a variable force-
deﬂ ection characteristic is obtained by nesting two 
springs, one inside the other, having different free 
lengths. This type of concentric spring is shown 
in Fig. 10.25(a). The shorter spring begins to act 
only after the longer spring has been compressed 
to a certain amount of deﬂ ection. As shown in Fig. 
10.25(b), the force-deﬂ ection characteristics of this 
type of concentric spring are as follows:
Force deﬂ ection characteristic of longer spring 
= ab
Force deﬂ ection characteristic of shorter spring 
= cd
Force deﬂ ection characteristic of composite 
spring = agh
It is observed that agh is not a straight line. 
Initially, the concentric spring follows the straight 
line ag, and at g, there is a sudden change in the 
load-deﬂ ection relationship and then it follows 
the straight line gh. This results in variable force-
deﬂ ection characteristic.
Fig. 10.25
This type of concentric spring is used in the 
governor of variable speed engines to take care of 
variable centrifugal force.
 The design analysis of concentric spring shown in 
Fig. 10.24, is based on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The springs are made of the same material.
 
(ii) The maximum torsional shear stresses 
induced in outer and inner springs are equal. 
 (iii) They have the same free length.
 (iv) Both springs are deﬂ ected by the same amount 
and therefore, have same solid length.
The following notations are used in the analysis:
 
d1 = wire diameter of outer spring
 
d2 = wire diameter of inner spring 
 
D1 = mean coil diameter of outer spring
 
D2 = mean coil diameter of inner spring
 
P1 = axial force transmitted by outer spring
 
P2 = axial force transmitted by inner spring
 
P = total axial force
 
d1 = deﬂ ection of outer spring
 
d2 = deﬂ ection of inner spring
Springs 427
 
N1 = number of active coils in outer spring
 
N2 = number of active coils in inner spring
Since the maximum torsional shear stresses 
induced in both springs are equal, t1 = t 2

When both springs are completely compressed,

Therefore, the load shared by each spring is 
proportional to the cross-sectional area of the wire.
The clearance between the inner diameter of the 
outer spring and outer diameter of the inner spring 
is an important parameter in design of concentric 
springs. It should have a certain minimum value to 
account for diametral expansion of springs under

Equations (10.23) and (10.26) are used to ﬁ nd

Example 10.17 A concentric spring is used as 
a valve spring in a heavy duty diesel engine. It 
consists of two helical compression springs having 
the same free length and same solid length. The 
composite spring is subjected to a maximum force 
of 6000 N and the corresponding deﬂ ection is 50 
mm. The maximum torsional shear stress induced in 
each spring is 800 N/mm2. The spring index of each 
spring is 6. Assume same material for two springs 
and the modulus of rigidity of spring material is 
81370 N/mm2. The diametral clearance between the 
coils is equal to the difference between their wire 
diameters. Calculate:
 
(i) the axial force transmitted by each spring;
 
(ii) wire and mean coil diameters of each spring; 
and

This type of spring is shown in Fig. 10.25. The 
free length of the outer spring is 15 mm greater than 
the inner spring. Therefore, the inner spring will not 
transmit any force till the outer spring is compressed 
by 15 mm. Suppose P is the axial force on the outer 
spring corresponding to this compression.
 
 P = ko d = 28.25 (15) = 423.75 N
After this load, both springs are active and each 
will transmit the force. 
Remaining load shared by two springs = 1000 
– 423.75 = 576.25 N
Concentric springs are parallel springs. From
Eq. (10.12),
 k = ko + ki = 28.25 + 29.43 = 57.68 N/mm 
where k is the combined stiffness of the composite 
spring. Suppose x is the further compression of two 
springs.
 Remaining load = kx  or 576.25 = 57.68 x
 
x = 9.99 mm
Compression of outer spring = do = 15 + 9.99
 
= 24.99 mm

10.12 OPTIMUM DESIGN OF HELICAL  
 SPRING
In certain applications, springs are designed with 
a speciﬁ c objective, such as minimum weight, 
minimum volume or maximum energy storage 
capacity. In such analysis, only one objective is 
considered at a time for a given application. In 
this section, we shall discuss the optimum design 
of a valve spring. The operating mechanism of 
the exhaust valve of a diesel engine is shown in 
Fig. 10.22. The valve-spring is required to meet the 
following two conditions:
 
(i) The force acting on the spring at the most 
extended position should have a certain 
minimum value (Pmin.). This force is 
required to keep the valve closed and can be 
considered as pre-compression.
 
(ii) When the spring is subjected to maximum 
compression and the valve is completely 
open, the stress in the spring wire (tmax.) 
should not exceed the permissible torsional 
shear stress. 
For the purpose of analysis, the effect of inactive 
coils is neglected and the spring is designed on the 
basis of minimum weight.

Therefore, if the spring is to have minimum weight, 
it must be designed in such a way that the force acting 
at the most extended position (Pmin.) should be 50 per 
cent of the maximum force (Pmax.).
Example 10.20 A helical compression spring of 
the exhaust valve mechanism is initially compressed 
with a pre-load of 375 N. When the spring is 
further compressed and the valve is fully opened, 
the torsional shear stress in the spring wire should 
not exceed 750 N/mm2. Due to space limitations, 
the outer diameter of the spring should not exceed 
42 mm. The spring is to be designed for minimum 
weight. Calculate the wire diameter and the mean 
coil diameter of the spring.
Solution
 Given  Pmin. = 375 N tmax. = 750 N/mm2
 
Do = 42 mm 
Step I Wire diameter
For minimum weight,
Pmax. = 2Pmin. = 2(375) = 750 N
 Assuming the outer diameter to be 42 mm,

10.13  SURGE IN SPRING
When the natural frequency of vibrations of the 
spring coincides with the frequency of external 
periodic force, which acts on it, resonance occurs. 
In this state, the spring is subjected to a wave of 
successive compressions of coils that travels from 
one end to the other and back. This type of vibratory 
motion is called ‘surge’ of spring. Surge is found 
in valve springs, which are subjected to periodic 
force.
 Let us consider a helical compression spring, one 
end of which is held against a ﬂ at rigid surface and the 
other end is subjected to a periodic external force. It 
always takes some ‘time’ to transmit this force from 
one end to the other. The force is transmitted by 
compression of coils. Initially, the end coil in contact 
with external force compresses and then it transmits 
a large portion of its compression to the adjacent 
second coil. The second coil compresses and in turn, 
transmits its major compression to the third coil. 
This process continues and a wave of compressed 
coils travels along the length of the spring till it 
reaches the end supported on rigid surface where 
it is ‘reﬂ ected’ back. The reﬂ ected wave travels 
back to the end in contact with the external force. 
If the time required for the wave to travel from one 
end to the other and back coincides with the time 
interval between successive load applications of 
periodic external force, resonance occurs and very 
large deﬂ ections of the coils are produced resulting 
in very high stresses. Many times, this stress in the 
coils is more than the endurance limit stress of the 
spring and fatigue failure occurs. Surge is the main 
cause of failure in valve springs.
The natural frequency of helical compression 
springs held between two parallel plates is given

¯˜
 
 l = length of spring = (pD Nt) 
 
r = mass density of spring material
Surge in springs is avoided by the following 
methods:
 
(i) The spring is designed in such a way that 
the natural frequency of the spring is 15 to 
20 times the frequency of excitation of the 
external force. This prevents the resonance 
condition to occur.
 
(ii) The spring is provided with friction dampers 
on central coils. This prevents propagation 
of surge wave. 
 (iii) A spring made of stranded wire reduces the 
surge. In this case, the wire of the spring 
is made of three strands. The direction of 
winding of strands is opposite to the direction 
of winding of the coils while forming the 
spring. In case of compression of the coils, 
the spring tends to wind the individual 
wires closer together, which introduces 
friction. This frictional damping reduces the 
possibility of surge.
Surge is a serious problem in typical vibrations 
like valve springs and guns. It is not a problem in 
other applications where the external load is steady. 
10.14 HELICAL TORSION SPRINGS
A helical torsion spring is a device used to transmit 
the torque to a particular component of a machine or 
mechanism. It is widely used in door hinges, brush 
holders, automobile starters and door locks. As 
shown in Fig. 10.27, the construction of the helical 
torsion spring is similar to that of compression or 
extension springs, except that the ends are formed in 
such a way that the spring is loaded by a torque about 
the axis of the coils. The helical torsion spring resists 
the bending moment (P ¥ r), which tends to wind up 
the spring. The primary stresses in this spring are 
ﬂ exural in contrast with torsional shear stresses in 
compression or extension springs. The term ‘torsion 
spring’ is somewhat misleading, because the wire 
of the spring is subjected to bending stresses. Each 
individual section of the torsion spring is, in effect, 
a portion of a curved beam. Using the curved beam 
theory, the bending stresses are given by

Helical torsion springs are cold-wound and 
residual stresses are set up due to cold working. The 
direction of the external force acting on the spring 
should be such that it tends to wind up the spring. 
In this case, the resulting stresses are opposite to 
the residual stresses. On the other hand, when the 
external force tends to unwind the spring, stress-
relieving treatment is required.
The design of the helical torsion spring is based 
on the torque-stress and the torque-deﬂ ection 
equations. The spring index is generally kept from 5 
to 15. When it is less than 5, the strain on the coiling 
arbor of the torsion winder causes excessive tool 
breakage. When it is more than 15, the control over 
the spring pitch is lost.
Example 10.21 It is required to design a helical 
torsion spring for a window shade. The spring 
is made of patented and cold-drawn steel wire of 
Grade-4. The yield strength of the material is 60% 
of the ultimate tensile strength and the factor of 
safety is 2. From space considerations, the mean 
coil diameter is kept as 18 mm. The maximum 
bending moment acting on the spring is 250 N-mm. 
The modulus of elasticity of the spring material is 
207 000 N/mm2. The stiffness of the spring should 
be 3 N-mm/rad. Determine the wire diameter and 
the number of active coils.

10.15  SPIRAL SPRINGS
A spiral spring consists of a thin strip of rectangular 
cross-section, which is wound in the form of spiral 
as shown in Fig. 10.29. It is also called ‘power’ 
spring or ‘ﬂ at’ spiral spring. The inner end of this 
strip is ﬁ xed in the arbor at the centre. The outer end 
is clamped to a drum called ‘retaining’ drum. The 
spring is wound by rotating the arbor and during the 
winding process, energy is stored in the spring. This 
energy is released as mechanical torque through 
the drum when it gradually rotates and unwinds 
the spring. The strip is made of high quality steel. 
It is very thin which results in high ﬂ exibility and 
enables the arbor to have large angular deﬂ ection. 
In many applications, the angular deﬂ ection of the 
arbor is several dozens of revolutions. This results 
in accumulation of considerable amount of energy. 
Very often, the drum is integral with a gear and 
energy is released by rotation of this gear to another 
gear that drives a mechanism. Spiral springs are 
widely used in watches, cameras, instruments and 
automatic weapons. All types of toys are powered 
by this type of spring. They are also used as starters 
for small engines.
Fig. 10.29 Spiral Spring
As shown in Fig. 10.30, the strip of spiral spring 
is subjected to pure bending moment. The following 
Fig. 10.30
notations are used in the analysis of spiral spring:
P = force induced at the outer end A due to  
 
winding of the arbor (N)
r = distance of centre of gravity of spiral from

Example 10.22 A ﬂ at spiral spring is required to 
provide a maximum torque of 1200 N-mm. The spring 
is made of a steel strip and the maximum bending 
stress should not exceed 800 N/mm2. When the stress 
in the spring decreases from 800 to 0 N/mm2, the 
arbor turns through three complete revolutions with 
respect to the retaining drum. The thickness of the 
steel strip is 1.25 mm and the modulus of elasticity 
is 207 000 N/mm2. Calculate the width and length of 
the steel strip.

10.16 MULTI-LEAF SPRING
Multi-leaf springs are widely used for the suspension 
of cars, trucks and railway wagons. A multi-leaf 
spring consists of a series of ﬂ at plates, usually of 
semi-elliptical shape, as shown in Fig. 10.31. The 
ﬂ at plates are called leaves of the spring. The leaves 
have graduated lengths. The leaf at the top has 
maximum length. The length gradually decreases 
from the top leaf to the bottom leaf. The longest 
leaf at the top is called master leaf. It is bent at 
both ends to from the spring eyes. Two bolts are 
inserted through these eyes to ﬁ x the leaf spring to 
the automobile body. The leaves are held together 
by means of two U-bolts and a centre clip. Rebound 
clips are provided to keep the leaves in alignment 
and prevent lateral shifting of the leaves during 
operation. At the centre, the leaf spring is supported 
on the axle. Multi-leaf springs are provided with 
one or two extra full length leaves in addition to 
master leaf. The extra full-length leaves are stacked 
between the master leaf and the graduated length 
leaves. The extra full-length leaves are provided to 
support the transverse shear force.
For the purpose of analysis, the leaves are 
divided into two groups namely, master leaf along 
with graduated-length leaves forming one group 
and extra full-length leaves forming the other. The 
following notations are used in the analysis:
nf  = number of extra full-length leaves
 ng = number of graduated-length leaves
 
including master leaf
n = total number of leaves
 b = width of each leaf (mm)
t = thickness of each leaf (mm) 
Fig. 10.31 Semi-elliptic Leaf Spring
L = length of the cantilever or half the length
 
of semi-elliptic spring (mm) 
P = force applied at the end of the spring (N) 
Pf = portion of P taken by the extra full-length  
 
leaves (N) 
Pg = portion of P taken by the graduated-length  
 
leaves (N)
The group of graduated-length leaves along with 
the master leaf can be treated as a triangular plate, 
as shown in Fig. 10.32. In this case, it is assumed 
438 Design of Machine Elements
that the individual leaves are separated and the master 
leaf placed at the centre. Then the second leaf is cut 
longitudinally into two halves, each of width (b/2) 
and placed on each side of the master leaf. A similar 
procedure is repeated for the other leaves. The resultant 
shape is approximately a triangular plate of thickness 
t and a maximum width at the support as (ng b). The 
bending stress in the plate at the support is given by,

Multi-leaf springs are designed using load-
stress and load-deﬂ ection equations. The standard 
dimensions for the width and thickness of the leaf 
section are as follows:6 
Nominal thickness (mm): 3.2, 4.5, 5, 6, 6.5,
7, 7.5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16
Nominal width (mm): 32, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65,  
70, 75, 80, 90, 100 and 125
The leaves are usually made of steels, 55Si2Mn90, 
50Cr1 or 50CrlV23. The plates are hardened 
and tempered. The factor of safety based on the 
yield strength is from 2 to 2.5 for the automobile 
suspension.
10.17 NIPPING OF LEAF SPRINGS
As discussed in the previous section, the stresses 
in extra full-length leaves are 50% more than the 
stresses in graduated-length leaves. One of the 
methods of equalising the stresses in different 
leaves is to pre-stress the spring. The pre-stressing 
is achieved by bending the leaves to different radii 
of curvature, before they are assembled with the 
centre clip. As shown in Fig. 10.34, the full-length 
leaf is given a greater radius of curvature than the 
adjacent leaf. The radius of curvature decreases with 
shorter leaves. The initial gap C between the extra 
full-length leaf and the graduated-length leaf before 
the assembly, is called a ‘nip’. Such pre-stressing, 
achieved by a difference in radii of curvature, 
is known as ‘nipping’. Nipping is common in 
automobile suspension springs.

The deﬂ ection of the multi-leaf spring due 
to the external force P is the same as given by
Eq. (10.38). 
Example 10.24 A semi-elliptic leaf spring used 
for automobile suspension consists of three extra 
full-length leaves and 15 graduated-length leaves, 
including the master leaf. The centre-to-centre 
distance between two eyes of the spring is 1 m. The 
maximum force that can act on the spring is 75 kN. 
For each leaf, the ratio of width to thickness is 9:1. 
The modulus of elasticity of the leaf material is
207 000 N/mm2. The leaves are pre-stressed in such 
a way that when the force is maximum, the stresses 
induced in all leaves are same and equal to 450
N/mm2. Determine
 
(i) the width and thickness of the leaves;
 
(ii) the initial nip; and
 (iii) the initial pre-load required to close the 
gap C between extra full-length leaves and 
graduated-length leaves.

Example 10.25 A semi-elliptic multi-leaf spring

leaf. The centre-to-centre distance between the 
spring eyes is 1.2 m. The leaves are made of steel 
55Si2Mo90 (Syt = 1500 N/mm2 and E = 207 000

10.18   BELLEVILLE SPRING
A Belleville spring consists of a coned disk as 
shown in Fig. 10.35. It resembles a dinner plate 
without a bottom. This type of spring is also called 
‘coned disk’ spring. It is called Belleville spring 
because it was invented by Julian Belleville, who 
patented its design in France in 1867. The Belleville 
Fig. 10.35 Belleville Spring
spring has typical load-deﬂ ection characteristics 
as shown in Fig. 10.36. The variation of (h/t) ratio 
produces a wide variety of load deﬂ ection curves. 
For example, when (h/t) ratio is 3.5, an S-curve is 
obtained which is useful in applications involving 
snap acting mechanism. When (h/t) is reduced 
to 2.1, the central portion of the curve becomes 
horizontal, which means that the load is constant for 
Fig. 10.36 
Load Deﬂ ection Curves for Belleville 
Springs
this range of deﬂ ection. This portion of the curve is 
useful for engaging or disengaging the clutch, when 
the Belleville spring is used as a clutch spring. The 
Belleville spring offers the following advantages:
442 Design of Machine Elements
 
(i) It is simple in construction and easy to 
manufacture.
 
(ii) The Belleville spring is a compact spring 
unit.
 (iii) It is especially useful where very large force 
is desired for small deﬂ ection of the spring.
 (iv) It provides a wide range of spring constants 
making it versatile.
 
(v) It can provide any linear or non-linear load-
deﬂ ection characteristic.
 (vi) The individual coned disks of a particular 
size and thickness can be stacked in series, 
parallel or series–parallel combinations as 
shown in Fig. 10.37. These combinations 
provide a variety of spring constants 
without changing the design. When two 
Belleville springs are arranged in series, 
double deﬂ ection is obtained for the 
same force. On the other hand, when two 
Belleville springs are in parallel, almost 
double force is obtained for a given 
deﬂ ection.

Belleville springs are used in plate clutches and 
brakes, gun recoil mechanisms, relief valves and a 
wide variety of bolted connections. 
The analysis of the Belleville spring is exceedingly 
complex, and mathematical treatment is beyond the 
scope of this book. The load-deﬂ ection and load-stress

10.19  SHOT PEENING
In a large number of applications, the external force 
acting on the spring ﬂ uctuates with respect to time 
resulting in fatigue failure. Due to poor surface ﬁ nish 
of the spring wire, the fatigue crack usually begins 
with some surface irregularity and propagates due to 
tensile stresses. It has been observed that propagation 
of fatigue crack is always due to tensile stresses. In 
order to reduce the chances of crack propagation, 
a layer of residual compressive stress is induced in 
the surface of the spring wire. One of the methods of 
creating such a layer is shot peening. In this process, 
small steel balls are impinged on the wire surface 
with high velocities either by an air blast or by 
centrifugal action. The balls strike against the wire 
surface and induce residual compressive stresses. 
The depth of the layer of the residual compressive 
stresses depends upon a number of factors, such 
as size of the balls, velocity of striking, original 
hardness and ductility of the spring wire. These 
parameters are adjusted in such a manner as to 
produce the required depth of layer of compressive 
stress. Shot peening is effective for springs loaded 
only in one direction, such as helical compression, 
helical extension or torsion bar springs.

Fig. 10.38. It consists of a plunger, which 
is mounted in the main body covering the 
outlet opening. It is held against the inlet 
opening by means of a helical compression 
spring, with adjustable compression. When 
the force due to hydraulic pressure acting on 
the plunger exceeds the initial setting of the 
spring, the plunger is lifted up, permitting the 
oil to relieve into the outlet opening. Since 
the valve is occasionally used, the spring is 
to be designed for static load.

Friction Clutches
Chapter 11
11.1 CLUTCHES
The clutch is a mechanical device, which is used to 
connect or disconnect the source of power from the 
remaining parts of the power transmission system 
at the will of the operator. An automotive clutch 
can permit the engine to run without driving the car. 
This is desirable when the engine is to be started or 
stopped, or when the gears are to be shifted. 
Very often, three terms are used together, 
namely, couplings, clutches and brakes. There is 
a basic difference between the coupling and the 
clutch. A coupling, such as a ﬂ ange coupling, is 
a permanent connection. The driving and driven 
shafts are permanently attached by means of 
coupling and it is not possible to disconnect the 
shafts, unless the coupling is dismantled. On the 
other hand, the clutch can connect or disconnect the 
driving and driven shafts, as and when required by 
the operator. Similarly, there is a basic difference 
between initial and ﬁ nal conditions in clutch and 
brake operations. In the operation of clutch, the 
conditions are as follows: 
(i) Initial Condition The driving member is 
rotating and the driven member is at rest.
(ii) Final Condition Both members rotate at the 
same speed and have no relative motion.
In the operation of brake, the conditions are as 
follows:
(i) Initial Condition One member such as the 
brake drum is rotating and the braking member 
such as the brake shoe is at rest.
(ii) Final Condition Both members are at rest and 
have no relative motion.
Clutches are classiﬁ ed into the following four 
groups:
(i) Positive contact Clutches They include square 
jaw clutches; spiral jaw clutches and toothed 
clutches. In these clutches, power transmission is 
achieved by means of interlocking of jaws or teeth. 
Their main advantage is positive engagement and 
once coupled, they can transmit large torque with 
no slip.
(ii) Friction Clutches They include single and 
multi-plate clutches, cone clutches and centrifugal 
clutches. In these clutches, power transmission is 
achieved by means of friction between contacting 
surfaces. This chapter is restricted to friction 
clutches.
(iii) Electromagnetic 
Clutches They 
include 
magnetic particle clutches, magnetic hysteresis 
clutches and eddy current clutches. In these 
clutches, power transmission is achieved by means 
of the magnetic ﬁ eld. These clutches have many 
advantages, such as rapid response time, ease of 
control, and smooth starts and stops.
Friction Clutches 449
(iv) Fluid 
Clutches 
and 
Couplings In 
these 
clutches, power transmission is achieved by means 
of hydraulic pressure. A ﬂ uid coupling provides 
extremely smooth starts and absorbs shock.
The simplest form of positive contact clutches 
is the square jaw clutch as shown in Fig. 11.1. It 
consists of two halves carrying projections or jaws. 
One clutch half is ﬁ xed and the other can move 
along the axis of the shaft over either a feather 
key or splines by means of shift lever. During the 
engagement, the jaws of the moving half enter into 
the sockets of the mating half. The engaging surfaces 
of jaw and socket form a rigid mechanical junction. 
Jaw clutches can be used to connect shafts, when 
the driving shaft is stationary or rotating at very low 
velocity. There are two types of jaws, namely, square 
and spiral. The spiral jaws can be engaged at slightly 
higher speed without clashing. Frequent engagement 
results in wear of jaws. The jaw clutches have the 
following advantages:
 (a) They do not slip and engagement is positive.
 (b) No heat is generated during engagement or 
disengagement.
Fig. 11.1 Square Jaw Clutch
The jaw clutches have the following drawbacks:
 (a) Jaw clutches can be engaged only when both 
shafts are stationary or rotate with very small 
speed difference. 
 (b) They cannot be engaged at high speeds 
because engagement of jaws and sockets 
results in shock.
In general, positive contact clutches are rarely 
used as compared with friction clutches. However, 
they have some important applications where 
synchronous operation is required like power 
presses and rolling mills. 
A single plate friction clutch consisting of 
two ﬂ anges is shown in Fig. 11.2. One ﬂ ange is 
rigidly keyed to the driving shaft, while the other 
is connected to the driven shaft by means of 
splines. The splines permit free axial movement of 
the driven ﬂ ange with respect to the driven shaft. 
This axial movement is essential for engagement 
and disengagement of the clutch. The actuating 
force is provided by a helical compression spring, 
which forces the driven ﬂ ange to move towards 
the driving ﬂ ange. Power is transmitted from the 
driving shaft to the driving ﬂ ange by means of the 
key. Power is then transmitted from the driving 
ﬂ ange to the driven ﬂ ange by means of frictional 
force. Finally, power is transmitted from the 
driven ﬂ ange to the driven shaft by means of the 
splines. Since the power is transmitted by means 
of frictional force between the driving and driven 
Fig. 11.2 Single Plate Clutch
ﬂ anges, the clutch is called ‘friction’ clutch. In 
order to disengage the clutch, a fork is inserted in 
the collar on the driven ﬂ ange to shift it axially to 
the right side. This relieves the pressure between 
the driving and the driven ﬂ anges and no torque can 
be transmitted. In the working condition, the clutch 
is in an engaged position under the action of spring 
force. Levers or forks are operated to ‘disengage’ 
the clutch. 
450 Design of Machine Elements
The main advantages of friction clutch are as 
follows:
 
(i) The engagement is smooth. 
 (ii) Slip occurs only during engaging operation 
and once the clutch is engaged, there is 
no slip between the contacting surfaces. 
Therefore, power loss and consequent heat 
generation do not create problems, unless the 
operation requires frequent starts and stops.
 (iii) In certain cases, the friction clutch serves 
as a safety device. It slips when the torque 
transmitted through it exceeds a safe value. 
This prevents the breakage of parts in the 
transmission chain.
Depending upon the number of friction surfaces, 
the friction clutches are classiﬁ ed as single-plate 
or multi-plate clutches. Depending upon the shape 
of the friction material, the clutches are classiﬁ ed 
as disk clutches, cone clutches or expanding shoe 
clutches. 
The following factors should be considered 
while designing friction clutches:
 
(i) Selection of a proper type of clutch that is 
suitable for the given application
 (ii) Selection of suitable friction material at the 
contacting surfaces
 (iii) Designing the clutch for sufﬁ cient torque 
capacity
 (iv) Engagement and disengagement should be 
without shock or jerk
 (v) Provision for holding the contacting surfaces 
together by the clutch itself and without any 
external assistance

CAPACITY
A friction disk of a single plate clutch is shown in 
Fig. 11.3. The following notations are used in the 
derivation:
 
D = outer diameter of friction disk (mm)
 
d = inner diameter of friction disk (mm)
 
p = intensity of pressure at radius r (N/mm2)
 
P = total operating force (N)
 Mt = torque transmitted by the clutch (N-mm)
Fig. 11.3 Friction Disk
The intensity of pressure p at radius r may be 
constant or may be variable.
Consider an elemental ring of radius r and radial 
thickness dr as shown in Fig. 11.4. For this ring, 
 
elemental area = (2pr dr)
 
elemental axial force = p(2pr dr)
 
 
= 2p(pr dr) 
(a)
 elemental friction force = mp(2pr dr) 
elemental friction torque = mp(2pr dr) r
 
= 2pm (pr2dr)

Friction Clutches 451
Two theories are used to obtain the torque 
capacity of the clutch. They are called uniform 
pressure theory and uniform wear theory.
(i) Uniform Pressure Theory In case of new 
clutches employing a number of springs, the 
pressure remains constant over the entire surface 
area of the friction disk. With this assumption, p 
is assumed to be constant. This constant pressure 
distribution is illustrated in Fig. 11.5(a). From

The above equations have been derived for a 
single pair of contacting surfaces. When there are 
a number of friction surfaces in contact, as in the 
case of the multi-disk clutch, Eq. (11.5) should be 
multiplied by the number of pairs of contacting 
surfaces to obtain the resultant torque transmitting 
capacity.
(ii) Uniform wear Theory According to the 
second theory, it is assumed that the wear is 
uniformly distributed over the entire surface area of 
the friction disk. This assumption is used for worn-
out clutches. The axial wear of the friction disk is 
proportional to the frictional work. The work done 
by the friction force at radius r is proportional to 
the frictional force (mp) and rubbing velocity
(2pr n) where n is speed in rev/min.
\ 
wear µ (m p) (2p rn)
Assuming speed n and the coefﬁ cient of friction 
m as constant for a given conﬁ guration,
 
wear µ pr
When the wear is uniform,
 
pr = constant
The pressure distribution according to uniform 
wear theory is illustrated in Fig. 11.5(b). In this 
case, p is inversely proportional to r. Therefore, 
pressure is maximum at the inner radius and 
minimum at the outer periphery. The maximum 
pressure intensity at the inner diameter (d/2) is 
denoted by pa. It is also the permissible intensity of 
pressure. Since pr is constant, 
 
pr = pa (d/2)

 (11.8)
The above equation gives the torque transmitting 
capacity for a single pair of contacting surfaces.
There are two phases of wear mechanism in 
friction lining. They are as follows:
 
(i) When the friction lining is new, uniform-
pressure theory is applicable. Therefore,
 
p = constant
 
 Since, 
wear µ pr \ 
wear µ r
 
 The wear at the outer radius will be more. 
Since the pressure plate is rigid, this wear 
will release the pressure at the outer edge.
 (ii) Since the pressure is released, there will be 
no further wear at the outer edge. The wear 
will now take place at the inner edge due 
to contact of the pressure plate. This will 
release pressure and stop further wear at the 
inner edge. This process of wear mechanism 
alternatively at the outer and inner radii will 
continue, till the pressure is adjusted in such 
a manner that the product pr is constant 
resulting in uniform wear at any radius. 
Based on above discussion, the following 
observations are made:
 
(i) The uniform-pressure theory is applicable 
only when the friction lining is new. When 
the lining is put into service, wear occurs. 
Therefore, a major portion of the life of 
friction lining comes under the uniform-
wear criterion and it is more logical to use 
uniform wear theory in design of clutches.
Equation (11.8) can be written in the following 
way:
 
Mt = mPRf
where Rf is called the friction radius.

 (ii) A comparison of Eqs. (a) and (b) in the 
above table shows that the friction radius 
for new clutches is slightly greater than for 
worn-out clutches. However, the difference 
between the two values is very small.
 (iii) Since the friction radius of new clutches 
is more, the torque transmitting capacity
(mPRf) is also more. On the other hand, the 
torque transmitting capacity of worn-out 
clutches is low due to lower friction radius. 
When we use uniform wear theory, we are 
on the safe side and assume lower torque 
carrying capacity for given dimensions. Such 
a clutch will have little more torque carrying 
capacity when it is new.
Conclusions
 
(i) The uniform-pressure theory is applicable 
only when the friction lining is new.
 (ii) The uniform-wear theory is applicable when 
the friction lining gets worn out.
 (iii) The friction radius for new clutches is 
slightly greater than that of worn-out 
clutches.
 (iv) The torque transmitting capacity of new 
clutches is slightly more than that of worn-
out clutches.
 (v) A major portion of the life of friction lining 
comes under the uniform wear criterion.
 (vi) It is more logical and safer to use uniform-
wear theory in the design of clutches.

Therefore, the torque transmitting capacity can 
be increased by three methods:
 
(i)  Use 
friction 
material 
with 
a 
higher 
coefﬁ cient of friction (m) 
 (ii) Increase the plate pressure (P) 
 (iii) Increase the mean radius of the friction disk 
(rm)
In design of clutches, the following factors 
should be considered:
(i) Service Factor In order to start the machine 
from rest and accelerate it to the rated speed, the 
clutch should have torque capacity substantially 
higher than the nominal torque rating. In most 
of the cases, the accelerating or starting torque is 
much more than the running torque. If the clutch is 
not designed for this increased torque, it will slip 
under the load and no power can be transmitted. 
There is another factor to account for additional 
torque. In many applications, the torque developed 
by the prime mover ﬂ uctuates and also, the torque 
requirement by driven machinery ﬂ uctuates as in 
the case of presses. These two factors are accounted 
by means of service factor. For design purpose,
 (Mt)des = Ks (Mt)
where,
 
Ks = service factor
(Mt)des = torque capacity of clutch for design  
 
purpose
(Mt) = rated torque
There is no standardisation of service factors. 
Various manufacturers recommend different service 
factors for the applications.
(ii) Location of Clutch Let us consider a mill 
driven by a diesel engine. The optimum operating 
speed of the engine is too high for direct connection 
to the mill shaft. Therefore, a gearbox is provided 
to reduce the speed. In this set-up, a clutch is also 
required so that the engine can be started and 
brought up to the full speed before connecting to 
the mill shaft. In such applications, the question 
arises about the location of clutch—whether the 
clutch should be located between the engine and 
the gearbox or between the gearbox and the mill?
 The clutch is required to transmit a given power. 
The power transmitted by the clutch is the product 
of torque and speed. Therefore, greater the speed, 
lower is the torque to be transmitted. It is, therefore, 
logical to place the clutch at the high-speed side, 
that is, between the engine and the gearbox. Since 
the torque capacity is low, the cost of the clutch 
is also low. On the other hand, the speed is low 
between the gearbox and the mill and the clutch 
will have to transmit high torque, increasing the 
cost.
(iii) The coefﬁ cient of friction for automotive 
clutches, which use asbestos lining in contact 
with a cast iron surface, is taken from 0.3 to 0.4. 
The allowable pressure on the friction lining varies 
from 0.1 N/mm2 for large heavy-duty double-plate 
clutches to 0.25 N/mm2 for an average passenger-
car clutch. The allowable pressure for clutches with 
metal plates is from 0.7 to 1.05 N/mm2. 
Example 11.1 
 A 
plate 
clutch 
consists 
of 
one pair of contacting surfaces. The inner and 
outer diameters of the friction disk are 100 and 
200 mm respectively. The coefﬁ cient of friction 
is 0.2 and the permissible intensity of pressure is 
1 N/mm2. Assuming uniform-wear theory, calculate 
the power-transmitting capacity of the clutch at 
750 rpm.

Example 11.3 
An 
automotive 
plate 
clutch 
consists of two pairs of contacting surfaces with 
an asbestos friction lining. The torque transmitting 
capacity of the clutch is 550 N-m. The coefﬁ cient 
of friction is 0.25 and the permissible intensity of 
pressure is 0.5 N/mm2. Due to space limitations, 
the outer diameter of the friction disk is ﬁ xed as 
250 mm. Using uniform wear theory, calculate
 
(i) the inner diameter of the friction disk; and
 (ii) the spring force required to keep the clutch 
in an engaged position.
Solution
Given Mt = 550 N-m D = 250 mm m = 0.25 
pa = 0.5 N/mm2 number of pairs of contacting 
surfaces = 2
Step I Inner diameter of friction disk 
The friction disk of the automotive clutch is ﬁ xed 
between the ﬂ ywheel on one side and the pressure 
plate on the other. The friction lining is provided on 
both sides of the friction disk. There are two pairs 
of contacting surfaces—one between the ﬂ ywheel 
and the friction disk and the other between the 
friction disk and the pressure plate. Therefore, 
the torque transmitted by one pair of contacting 
surfaces is (550/2) or 275 N-m.

three roots:
 
(i) d = 174.16 mm
 (ii) d = 112.29 mm
 (iii) d = –286.46 mm
Mathematically, all the three answers are correct. 
The inner diameter cannot be negative. As a design 
engineer, one should select the inner diameter as 
174.16 mm, which results in a minimum area of 
friction lining compared with 112.29 mm. For 
minimum cost of friction lining,
 
d = 174 mm

of only one pair of contacting surfaces. It is 
used for an engine, which develops a maximum 
torque of 120 N-m. Assume a factor of safety of 
1.5 to account for slippage at full-engine torque. 
The permissible intensity of pressure is 350 kPa 
and the coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.35. Assuming 
uniform wear theory, calculate the inner and outer 
diameters of the friction lining.

asbestos friction lining. The maximum engine 
torque is 250 N-m. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 
0.35. The inner and outer diameters of friction 
lining are 175 and 250 mm respectively. The 
clamping force is provided by nine springs, each 
456 Design of Machine Elements
compressed by 5 mm to give a force of 800 N, when 
the clutch is new.
 
(i) What is the factor of safety with respect to 
slippage when the clutch is brand new?
 (ii) What is the factor of safety with respect to 
slippage after initial wear has occurred?
 (iii) How much wear of friction lining can take 
place before the clutch will slip? 
Solution
 Given  Mt = 250 N-m D = 250 mm 
d = 175 mm m = 0.35 number of pairs = 2
For springs, P = 800 N d = 5 mm
number of springs = 9
Step I Factor of safety against slippage for new clutch
There are two pairs of contacting surfaces. The 
torque transmitted by one pair should be (250/2) or 
125 N-m.

Step III Wear of friction lining before slippage
The clutch will slip when the spring force is no 
longer in a position to transmit the engine torque. 
The spring force required to transmit the engine

spring will be less than 373.48 N, the clutch will 
slip. Suppose x is the wear of friction lining for this

11.3 MULTI-DISK CLUTCHES
A multi-disk clutch, as shown in Fig. 11.7, consists 
of two sets of disks—A and B. Disks of Set A are 
usually made of hardened steel, while those of Set 
B are made of bronze. Disks of Set A are connected 
to the driven shaft by means of splines. Because of 
splines, they are free to move in an axial direction 
on the splined sleeve. There are four through bolts, 
which pass through the holes in the disks of Set B. 
A clearance ﬁ t between the bolt and the holes in 
the plates allows disks of Set B to move in an axial 
direction. The bolts are rigidly ﬁ xed to a rotating 
drum, which is keyed to the driving shaft. The 
axial force P, which is required to hold the disks 
together, is provided by means of levers or springs. 
When the driving shaft rotates, the drum, along 
Friction Clutches 457
with bolts and disks of Set B, also rotate. Power is 
transmitted from the disks of Set B to those of A by 
means of friction. When the disks of Set A rotate, 
they transmit the power to the driven shaft through 
splined sleeve.

where z is the number of pairs of contacting

 In the design of multi-disk clutches, very often it 
is required to determine the number of disks rather 
than the number of pairs of contacting surfaces. In 
multi-disk clutch, illustrated in Fig.11.7, there are 
two types of disks called disks of Set A and disks of 
Set B. We can use steel disks for Set A and bronze 
disks for Set B. Or, we can use plane steel disks 
for Set A and Set B consisting of steel disks with 
asbestos lining. Let us consider 5 disks—3 disks of 
Set A and 2 disks of Set B. As shown in Fig.11.8, 
the number of pairs of contacting surfaces is 4. 
Therefore,
Fig. 11.8 Number of Disks
Number of disks = number of pairs of contacting 
surfaces + 1 = z +1 
(a)
Suppose, 
 z1 = number of disks on driving shaft
z2 = number of disks on driven shaft
Substituting in (a), 
z1 + z2 = number of pairs of contacting surfaces + 1
or  number of pairs of contacting surfaces 
= (z1 + z2 – 1)
It should be noted that the two outer disks have 
contacting surface on one side only.
The difference between single and multi-plate 
clutches is as follows:
 
(i) The number of pairs of contacting surfaces in 
the single plate clutch is one or at the most, 
two. There are more number of contacting 
surfaces in the multi-disk clutch.
 (ii) As the number of contacting surfaces is 
increased, the torque transmitting capacity is 
also increased, other conditions being equal. 
In other words, for a given torque capacity, 
the size of the multi-plate clutch is smaller 
than that of the single plate clutch, resulting 
in compact construction. 
 (iii) The work done by friction force during 
engagement is converted into heat. More 
heat is generated in the multi-plate clutch 
due to increased number of contacting 
surfaces. Heat dissipation is a serious 
problem in the multi-plate clutch. Therefore, 
multi-plate clutches are wet clutches, while 
single plate clutches are dry.
458 Design of Machine Elements
 (iv) The coefﬁ cient of friction decreases due 
to cooling oil, thereby reducing the torque 
transmitting capacity of the multi-plate 
clutch. The coefﬁ cient of friction is high in 
dry single plate clutches. 
 (v) Single plate clutches are used in applications 
where large radial space is available, such as 
trucks and cars. Multi-disk clutches are used 
in applications where compact construction 
is desirable, e.g., scooter and motorcycle.
The difference between dry and wet clutches is 
as follows:
 
(i) A dry clutch has higher coefﬁ cient of 
friction. In wet clutches, the coefﬁ cient of 
friction is reduced due to oil. The coefﬁ cient 
of friction for dry operation is 0.3 or more, 
while it is 0.1 or less for wet operation.
 (ii) The torque capacity of dry clutch is high 
compared with the torque capacity of wet 
clutch of the same dimensions.
 (iii) For dry clutch, it is necessary to prevent 
contamination due to moisture or nearby 
lubricated machinery, by providing seals. 
Such a problem is not serious in wet 
clutches.
 (iv) Heat dissipation is more difﬁ cult in dry 
clutches. In wet clutches, the lubricating oil 
carries away the frictional heat.
 (v) Rate of wear is far less in wet clutches 
compared to dry clutches. The wear rate in 
wet clutches is about 1% of the rate expected 
in dry clutches.
 (vi) The engagement in wet clutch is smoother 
than in the case of dry clutch.
 (vii) In 
wet 
clutches, 
the 
clutch 
facings 
are grooved to provide for passage of 
lubricant. This reduces the net face area for 
transmitting torque. 
Example 11.7 An oil immersed multi-disk clutch 
with cork sheet as the friction material is used on 
a scooter engine. The friction disk of such a clutch 
is shown in Fig. 11.9. The torque transmitted by 
the clutch is 10 N-m. The coefﬁ cient of friction 
between the cork sheet and the steel plate in the 
wet condition is 0.2. The permissible pressure on 
the cork sheet is 0.1 N/mm2. The inner and outer 
diameters of the friction lining are 65 and 95 mm 
respectively. There are radial slots, on the friction 
surface for the circulation of the coolant, which 
reduces the effective friction area. To account 
for these slots, the number of contacting surfaces 
can be increased by 5%. Assuming uniform-wear 
theory, calculate the required number of contacting 
surfaces.

on the other, is used in an application. The torque 
transmitted by the clutch is 75 N-m. The coefﬁ cient 
of friction between the asbestos lining and the steel 
plate in the wet condition is 0.1. The permissible 
intensity of pressure on the asbestos lining is 500 
kPa. The outer diameter of the friction lining is 
kept as 100 mm due to space limitation. Assuming

11.4 FRICTION MATERIALS
For light loads and low speeds, wood, cork and 
leather are used as friction materials. The present 
trend for high speeds and heavy loads has given 
a stimulus to the development of new friction 
materials, which are capable of withstanding severe 
service conditions. 
The desirable properties of a good friction 
material are as follows:
 
(i) It should have high coefﬁ cient of friction.
 (ii) The coefﬁ cient of friction should remain 
constant over the entire range of tempera-
tures encountered in applications.
 (iii) It should have good thermal conductivity.
 (iv) It should remain unaffected by environmental 
conditions like moisture, or dirt particles.
460 Design of Machine Elements
 (v) It should have high resistance to abrasive 
and adhesive wear.
 (vi) It should have good resilience to provide 
good 
distribution 
of 
pressure 
at 
the 
contacting surfaces.
The coefﬁ cient of friction depends upon a number 
of factors. They include materials of contacting 
surfaces, surface ﬁ nish, surface temperature, rubbing 
speed, foreign particles on rubbing surfaces and 
atmospheric conditions like moisture.
There are two types of friction materials in 
common use—asbestos-base and sintered metals.
There are two types of asbestos friction 
materials—woven and moulded. A woven asbestos 
friction disk consists of asbestos ﬁ bre woven 
around brass, copper or zinc wires and impregnated 
with rubber or asphalt. They have an endless 
circular weave, which increases the centrifugal 
bursting strength. Moulded asbestos friction disks 
are prepared from the wet mixture of brass chips 
and asbestos, which is poured into the mould and 
given the shape of the disk. The mixture is then 
heated and pressed for a speciﬁ c curing time. The 
difference between woven and moulded asbestos 
materials is as follows:
 
(i) Woven material is ﬂ exible, while moulded 
asbestos is rigid.
 (ii) Woven material has higher coefﬁ cient of 
friction.
 (iii) Woven material conforms more readily to 
clutch surface while moulded materials take 
longer time to wear in the seat.
 (iv) Woven materials are not only costly, but also 
wear at a faster rate, resulting in high cost in 
the long run.
Asbestos material, whether woven or moulded, 
is an organic material and is subject to destruction 
by heat at comparatively low temperature. 
Sintered-metal 
friction 
materials 
solve 
this 
difﬁ culty.
There are two varieties of friction disks made 
from sintered metals—bronze-base and iron-
base, depending upon the major constituent. The 
advantages of sintered-metal friction disks are as 
follows:
 
(i) They have higher wear resistance.
 (ii) They can be used at high temperatures.
 (iii) The coefﬁ cient of friction is constant over a 
wide range of temperature and pressure.
 (iv) They are unaffected by environmental 
conditions, such as dampness, salt water or 
fungi.
Sintered-metal friction materials offer an 
excellent design with lighter, cheaper and 
compact construction. The maximum permissible 
intensity of pressure for woven and moulded 
asbestos materials is 0.3 N/mm2 and 1.0 N/mm2 
respectively, while for sintered metals it can be 
taken between 1 and 2 N/mm2. The values of 
coefﬁ cient of friction for different combinations 
are given in Table 11.1.

It has been found that if asbestos dust is 
inhaled, it may lead to cancer. The body cells 
which come in contact with asbestos particles 
are agitated and develop into cancer cells. Lung 
cancer is common among operators working in 
atmospheres of asbestos dust. There are federal 
regulations in a number of countries, which 
prohibit the use of asbestos in clutch or brake 
linings. Nowadays, metallic or semi-metallic 
ﬁ bres or powder is used in place of asbestos 
ﬁ bres.
Modern friction lining consists of four basic 
ingredients, namely, ﬁ bres, ﬁ ller, binder and friction 
modiﬁ ers. Fibres provide rigidity and strength for 
the friction lining. Nowadays, steel wool or aramid 
is used as ﬁ bre material instead of asbestos. A 
ﬁ ller ﬁ lls the space between the ﬁ bres and extend 
Friction Clutches 461
the lining life. Filler materials are barytes, clay 
and calcium carbonate. In case of metallic lining, 
ﬁ ne metal power is used as ﬁ ller material. Binder 
is a glue that holds the lining ingredients together. 
Phenolformaldehyde is extensively used as binder 
material. Friction modiﬁ er improves frictional 
and wear properties. Brass and zinc particles are 
added as friction modiﬁ ers to control the abrasive 
properties of the lining.
11.5 CONE CLUTCHES 
A cone clutch, as shown in Fig. 11.10, consists 
of inner and outer conical surfaces. The outer 
cone is keyed to the driving shaft, while the 
inner cone is free to slide axially on the driven 
Fig. 11.10 Cone Clutch
shaft due to splines. The axial force required 
to engage the clutch is provided by means of 
helical compression spring. In engaged position, 
power is transmitted from the driving shaft to the 
outer cone by means of the key. Power is then 
transmitted from the outer cone to the inner cone 
by means of friction. Finally, power is transmitted 
from the inner cone to the driven shaft by means 
of the splines. In order to disengage the clutch, a 
fork is inserted in the shifting collar to shift it 
axially towards right side. This releases pressure 
between inner and outer cones and no torque can 
be transmitted. Leather, cork or asbestos are used 
for the friction lining on the inner cone. The conical 
surface results in considerable friction force even 
with a small engaging force due to the wedge 
action. The recommended semi-cone angle (a) is 
12.5°. The cone clutches are simple in construction 
and easy to disengage. Their main drawback is the 
strict requirement for the coaxiality of two shafts. 
The equations for the torque transmitting capacity 
of the cone clutch are derived in a manner similar 
to that of a single plate clutch. The dimensions 
of the friction cone are shown in Fig. 11.11. An 
elemental frustum of the cone bounded by circles 
of radii r and (r + dr) is considered for the purpose 
of analysis. Figure 11.12(a) shows this elemental 
frustum of cone. For this frustum,

(11.18)
The following observations are made:
 
(i) It is observed from the above equation, that 
the torque capacity is inversely proportional 
to sin a. The value of a should be as small 
as possible so that sin a will be less and Mt 
will be more. Therefore, the torque capacity 
of a cone clutch increases as the semi-cone 
angle decreases. 
 
 However, when a is less than the angle of 
static friction (f), the clutch has a tendency 
to grab, resulting in self-engagement. This 
is not desirable because the clutch should 
engage or disengage at the will of the 
operator. To avoid self-engagement and to 
facilitate disengagement,
 
   
a > angle of static friction
 
 Taking the coefﬁ cient of friction as 0.2,
 
  a > tan–1 m or a > tan–1 (0.2) or 11.3°
 
 Therefore, the semi-cone angle (a) is taken 
as 12.5°.
 (ii) For a given torque, 
 
 
Mt = constant
 
 From Eq. (11.18)
 
 
Mt = 
m
a
P
4sin
(D + d)  or P µ sin a
 
 Therefore, a relatively small axial force can 
transmit a given torque if the semi-cone 
angle is decreased. However, as the semi-
cone angle decreases, there is more wedging 
action and the force required to disengage 
increases. Thus, a clutch with a small semi-
cone angle requires a relatively small force 
to engage the clutch but a relatively large 
force to disengage the clutch.
 
 From Eq. (11.8), the torque transmitting 
capacity of single plate clutch is, 
Mt = pP

Example 11.11 A cone clutch is used to 
connect an electric motor running at 1440 rpm 
with a machine which is stationary. The machine 
is equivalent to a rotor of 150 kg mass and 
radius of gyration as 250 mm. The machine has 
to be brought to the full speed of 1440 rpm from 
stationary condition in 40s. The semi-cone angle 
a is 12.5°. The mean radius of the clutch is twice 
the face width. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.2 and 
the normal intensity of pressure between contacting 
surfaces should not exceed 0.1 N/mm2. Assuming 
uniform wear criterion, calculate:
 
(i) the inner and outer diameters;
 (ii) the face width of friction lining;
 (iii) the force required to engage the clutch; and
 (iv) the amount of heat generated during each 
engagement of clutch.

11.6 CENTRIFUGAL CLUTCHES
Whenever it is required to engage the load after the 
driving member has attained a particular speed, a 
centrifugal clutch is used. The centrifugal clutches 
permit the drive-motor or engine to start, warm up 
and accelerate to the operating speed without load. 
Then the clutch is automatically engaged and the 
driven equipment is smoothly brought up to the 
operating speed. These clutches are particularly 
useful with internal combustion engines, which 
cannot start under load.
The centrifugal clutch works on the principle of 
centrifugal force. The centrifugal force increases 
with speed. The construction of centrifugal clutch is 
shown in Fig. 11.15. It consists of a spider, which is 
mounted on the input shaft, and which is provided 
with four equally spaced radial guides. A sliding 
shoe is retained in each guide by means of a spring. 
The outer surface of the sliding shoe is provided 
with a lining of friction material like asbestos. The 
complete assembly of spider, shoes and springs is 
enclosed in a coaxial drum, which is mounted on 
the output shaft. As the angular speed of the input 
shaft increases, the centrifugal force acting on the 
sliding shoes increases, causing the shoes to move 
in a radially outward direction. The shoes continue 
to move with increasing speed until they contact the 
inner surface of the drum. Power is transmitted due 
to frictional force between the shoe lining and the 
inner surface of the drum. The clutch is disengaged 
automatically. When the angular velocity of the 
shoes decreases, the centrifugal force decreases. 
This reduces the normal force between the friction 
lining and the drum. The friction force, which is 
proportional to normal force, also reduces. The 
lining slips with respect to the drum and no torque 
can be transmitted. 
The forces acting on the shoe are shown in 
Fig. 11.16, where following notations are used:
rd = radius of the drum (mm)
rg = radius of the centre of gravity of the shoe in 
 
engaged position (mm)
m = mass of each shoe (kg)
Pcf = centrifugal force (N)
Ps = spring force (N)
z = number of shoes
w 2 = running speed (rad/s)
w 1 = speed at which engagement starts (rad/s)

The centrifugal forces corresponding to speed 
ω1 and ω2 are given by,

  and (Pcf)2 =

1000
Fig. 11.16 Forces on Shoe
The term (1000) in the denominator is taken 
because rg is taken in mm. The centrifugal force 
(Pcf)1 is balanced by an equal and opposite 
spring force at the beginning of the engagement.

When the centrifugal force is slightly more 
than the spring force, the shoe begins to move in a 
radially outward direction. In the running condition, 
the net force acting on the drum is given by
 
Net force on drum = (Pcf)2 – Ps

There are two distinct applications of centrifugal 
clutch, namely, light-duty applications and heavy-
duty applications. They are as follows:
 
(i) In centrifugal clutch, the engagement is very 
smooth because the electric motor has a 
chance to accelerate and reach the operating 
speed, before it has to take up the load. 
Chain saws, lawnmowers, golf carts and 
small recreational vehicles use centrifugal 
clutch on this account.
 (ii) The centrifugal clutch is also useful in 
heavy-duty applications, where a high 
inertia load is to be brought up to the 
operating speed. By providing a ‘time delay’ 
that is sufﬁ cient to permit the prime mover 
to gain momentum before taking over the 
load, centrifugal clutches provide smooth 
engagement. Heavy mobile equipment such 
as cranes, cement mills, and ball mills use 
centrifugal clutches on this account.
The centrifugal clutches are used in small 
two wheelers like mopeds as well as large army 
vehicles like battle tanks.
Example 11.12 A centrifugal clutch, transmitting 
20 kW at 750 rpm consists of four shoes. The clutch 
is to be engaged at 500 rpm The inner radius of 
the drum is 165 mm. The radius of the centre of 
gravity of the shoes is 140 mm, when the clutch is 
engaged. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.3, while the 
permissible pressure on friction lining is 0.1 N/mm2 
Calculate:
 
(i) the mass of each shoe; and
 (ii) the dimensions of friction lining.
Solution
Given kW = 20 n2 = 750 rpm n1 = 500 rpm

Example 11.13 A centrifugal clutch consists of 
four shoes, each having a mass of 1.5 kg. In the 
engaged position, the radius to the centre of gravity 
of each shoe is 110 mm, while the inner radius of 
the drum is 140 mm. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 
0.3. The pre-load in the spring is adjusted in such 
a way that the spring force at the beginning of 
engagement is 700 N. The running speed is 1440 
rpm. Calculate 
 
(i) the speed at which the engagement begins; 
and

11.7 ENERGY EQUATION
A dynamic system consisting of driving and driven 
shafts and the clutch is illustrated in Fig. 11.18. 
The driving shaft is connected to the prime mover 
while the driven shaft to the machine. In many 
applications, the initial angular velocity of the 
driven shaft is zero. It is brought to full speed from 
rest by the clutching operation. When the clutch is 
fully engaged, the driving and driven shafts rotate 
at the same speed. However, during the clutching 
operation, slippage occurs because the two sides 
rotate at different speeds. Energy is dissipated 
during slippage, which is converted into frictional 
heat. When the clutch is fully engaged, there is 
no slip between the two surfaces and there is no 
friction or frictional heat. When the rate of heat 
generation is more than the rate at which the heat 
is dissipated to the surrounding, the temperature 
of the clutch assembly increases. Therefore, the 
permissible temperature rise is a limiting factor in 
the design of the clutch.
468 Design of Machine Elements
In dynamic analysis of the clutch, the following 
assumptions are made:
 
(i) The driving and driven shafts are rigid.
 (ii) Torque remains constant during clutching 
operation.
The following notations are used for the dynamic 
analysis of the system shown in Fig. 11.18,
I1 = moment of inertia of driving shaft (kg-m2)
a1 = angular acceleration of driving shaft 
(rad/s2)
w1 = angular velocity of driving shaft (rad/s)
q1 = angular displacement of driving shaft (rad)
I2 = moment of inertia of driven shaft (kg-m2)
a2 = angular acceleration of driven shaft (rad/s2)
w2 = angular velocity of driven shaft (rad/s)
q2 = angular displacement of driven shaft (rad)
Mt = clutch torque (N-m)

written as,

It is observed from the above expression that 
energy dissipated during clutching operation is 
independent of the torque and directly proportional 
to the square of relative velocity of the driving and 
driven shafts. 
11.8 THERMAL CONSIDERATIONS
The energy dissipated during the clutching 
operation is converted into frictional heat, which 
increases the temperature of the clutch assembly. 
The temperature rise is given by,
 
Dt = 
E
mc  
(11.28)
where,
m = mass of the clutch assembly (kg)
c = speciﬁ c heat of the clutch assembly (J/kg °C)
Dt = temperature rise (°C)
The speciﬁ c heat (c) of the clutch assembly 
made of either steel or cast iron is taken as
500 J/kg °C.
The actual temperature rise will be less than 
Dt because some heat will be radiated to the 
surrounding atmosphere and some will be carried 
away by air ﬂ ow in the vicinity of the clutch 
assembly. Equation (11.28) gives approximate 
value of the temperature rise.
When the clutch assembly is allowed to cool in 
the air after the clutching operation, the thermal 
analysis is carried by ‘lumped-heat-capacity’ 
method. It is based on the assumption that there is 
no temperature gradient within the clutch assembly. 
This is an idealised state because a temperature 
gradient must exist in the material if the heat is 
to be conducted into or out of the material. The 
assumption of uniform temperature throughout the 
clutch assembly is realistic provided that the size 
of the clutch assembly is small. The equation of 
convective heat transfer from the clutch assembly 
to the atmosphere is given by,
 
T – Ta = (Ti – Ta)e–(Ah/mc)t 
(11.29) 
where,
T = instantaneous temperature at time t ( °C)
Ta = ambient temperature (°C)
Ti = initial temperature (°C)
A = area for heat transfer (m2)
h = surface heat transfer coefﬁ cient (W/m2 °C) 
t = time (s)
The graph of temperature of the clutch assembly 
against time is shown in Fig. 11.19. It consists of 
the following parts:
 
(i) Initially, the clutch is disengaged and rotates 
in the atmosphere from time (t = to) to time
(t = t1). The temperature of the clutch 
assembly is equal to the atmospheric 
temperature Ta. The line AB on the 
temperature–time curve shows this stage.
 (ii) At time (t = t1) or the point B, there is 
ﬁ rst clutching operation. This results in 
instantaneous temperature rise Dt, which 
will increase the temperature of the clutch 
470 Design of Machine Elements
assembly from Ta to T1. The line BC on 
temperature–time curve shows this stage.
 (iii) The clutch assembly is allowed to cool 
in the air from time (t = t1) to time (t = t2). 
The temperature decreases according to 
Eq. (11.29). It will continue to fall along 
the curve CDG and reach atmospheric 
temperature unless there is another clutching 
operation.
 (iv) At the point D on the curve CDG, there is 
second clutching operation, which will result 
in instantaneous temperature rise Dt and the 
temperature will increase from D to E.
 (v) The temperature will fall along the curve 
EF according to Eq. (11.29) and reach 
atmospheric temperature in due course.

It is observed that frequency of clutching 
operation is an important parameter in thermal 
analysis of clutches.
Example 11.14 A single plate clutch is designed 
to transmit 10 kW power at 2000 rpm. The 
equivalent mass and radius of gyration of the 
input shaft are 20 kg and 75 mm respectively. The 
equivalent mass and radius of gyration of the 
output shaft are 35 kg and 125 mm respectively. 
Calculate:
 
(i) the time required to bring the output shaft to 
the rated speed from rest; and
 (ii) the heat generated during the clutching 
operation.
Solution
Given kW = 10 n1 = 2000 rpm
For input shaft, m1 = 20 kg k1 = 75 mm 
For output shaft, m2 = 35 kg k2 = 125 mm

Brakes
Chapter 12
12.1 BRAKES
A brake is deﬁ ned as a mechanical device, which is 
used to absorb the energy possessed by a moving 
system or mechanism by means of friction. The 
primary purpose of the brake is to slow down or 
completely stop the motion of a moving system, 
such as a rotating drum, machine or vehicle. It is 
also used to hold the parts of the system in position 
at rest. An automobile brake is used either to reduce 
the speed of the car or to bring it to rest. It is also 
used to keep the car stationary on the downhill 
road. The energy absorbed by the brake can be 
either kinetic or potential or both. In automobile 
application, the brake absorbs the kinetic energy 
of the moving vehicle. In hoists and elevators, 
the brake absorbs the potential energy released by 
the objects during the braking period. The energy 
absorbed by the brake is converted into heat energy 
and dissipated to the surroundings. Heat dissipation 
is a serious problem in brake applications.
Brakes are classiﬁ ed into the following three 
groups:
 
(i) Mechanical brakes, which are operated by 
mechanical means such as levers, springs 
and pedals. Depending upon the shape of 
the friction material, the mechanical brakes 
are classiﬁ ed as block brakes, internal or 
external shoes brakes, disk brakes and band 
brakes. Brakes are also classiﬁ ed into two 
groups according to the direction of the 
actuating force, namely, radial brakes and 
axial brakes. Internal and external shoe 
brakes are radial brakes, while disk brakes 
are axial brakes. The discussion in this 
chapter is restricted to mechanical brakes.
 (ii) Hydraulic and pneumatic brakes, which 
are operated by ﬂ uid pressure such as oil 
pressure or air pressure.
 (iii) Electrical brakes, which are operated by 
magnetic forces and which include magnetic 
particle brakes, hysteresis brakes and eddy-
current brakes.
Brake capacity depends upon the following three 
factors:
 
(i) The unit pressure between braking surfaces
 (ii) The contacting area of braking surface
 (iii) The radius of the brake drum
 (iv) The coefﬁ cient of friction
 (v) The ability of the brake to dissipate heat that 
is equivalent to the energy being absorbed
12.2 ENERGY EQUATIONS
The ﬁ rst step in the design of a mechanical brake 
is to determine the braking-torque capacity for the 
given application. The braking-torque depends 
upon the amount of energy absorbed by the brake. 
When a mechanical system of mass m moving 
with a velocity v1 is slowed down to the velocity 
Brakes 473

absorbed by the brake is given by

body (kg-m2)
 
k = radius of gyration of the body (m)
 w1, w 2 = initial and ﬁ nal angular velocities
 
of the body (rad/s)
In certain applications like hoists, the brake 
absorbs the potential energy released by the moving 
weight during the braking period. When a body of 
mass m falls through a distance h, the potential 
energy absorbed by the brake during the braking 
period is given by
 
 
PE = mgh 
(12.4)
where,
  
g = gravitational constant (9.81 m/s2)
Depending upon the type of application, the 
total energy absorbed by the brake is determined 
by adding the respective quantities of Eqs (12.1) to 
(12.4). This energy is equated to the work done by 
the brake.
Therefore,
 
 
E = Mtq 
(12.5)
where
 E = total energy absorbed by the brake (J)
 Mt = braking-torque (N-m)
 q = angle through which the brake drum
 
rotates during the braking period (rad)
Example 12.1 
A solid cast iron disk, 1 m in 
diameter and 0.2 m thick, is used as a ﬂ ywheel. It is 
rotating at 350 rpm. It is brought to rest in 1.5 s by 
means of a brake. Calculate
 
(i) the energy absorbed by the brake; and
 (ii) the torque capacity of the brake.
Solution
 Given  D = 1 m t = 0.2 m n1 = 350 rpm 
t = 1.5 s
Step I Energy absorbed by brake
The brake absorbs the kinetic energy of the rotating 
ﬂ ywheel. The mass density of cast iron is taken as 
7200 kg/m3. The radius of gyration of a solid disk 
about its axis of rotation is (d/ 8). Therefore,

Example 12.2 
A four-wheeled automobile car 
has a total mass of 1000 kg. The moment of inertia 
of each wheel about a transverse axis through its 
centre of gravity is 0.5 kg-m2. The rolling radius of 
the wheel is 0.35 m. The rotating and reciprocating 
parts of the engine and the transmission system 
are equivalent to a moment of inertia of 2.5 kg-m2, 
which rotates at ﬁ ve times the road-wheel speed. 
The car is traveling at a speed of 100 km/h on a

decelerates at 0.5 g. There are brakes on all four 
wheels. Calculate:

12.3 BLOCK BRAKE WITH SHORT SHOE
A block brake consists of a simple block, which 
is pressed against the rotating drum by means 
of a lever as shown in Fig. 12.2. The friction 
between the block and the brake drum causes 
the retardation of the drum. This type of brake is 
commonly employed in railway trains. The block 
is either rigidly attached to the lever or, in some
Fig. 12.2 Block Brake
applications, pivoted to the lever. The angle of 
contact between the block and the brake drum is 
usually small. When it is less than 45°, the intensity 
of pressure between the block and brake drum is 
uniform. The free-body diagram of forces acting on 
the drum and the lever is shown in Fig. 12.3. The 
analysis is based on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The block is rigidly attached to the lever.
 (ii) The angle of contact between the block and 
brake drum is small, resulting in uniform 
pressure distribution.
 (iii) The brake drum is rotating in clockwise 
direction.
Fig. 12.3 Free-body Diagram (Clockwise Rotation)
Considering the forces acting on the brake 
drum,
Mt = mNR 
(12.6)
where
Mt = braking torque (N-mm)
R = radius of the brake drum (mm)
m = coefﬁ cient of friction
N = normal reaction (N)
The dimensions of the block are determined by 
the following expression,
 
N = plw 
(12.7)
where
p = permissible pressure between the block and 
the brake drum (N/mm2)
l = length of the block (mm)
w = width of the block (mm)
The width of the block w is usually between one-
fourth and one-half of the drum diameter. When the 
width is small, the length of the block increases and 
the size of brake increases. Therefore, a narrower 
block results in an unnecessarily large size of 
brake. If the width is more, it becomes difﬁ cult to 
maintain uniform pressure distribution all over the 
surface of friction lining on the block. Therefore, a 
wider block results in variation in normal pressure 
distribution. The width of the block should be 
optimum between these two limits. The optimum 
value is given by,

  (12.9)
where P is the actuating force on the lever. 
Depending upon the magnitude of coefﬁ cient of 
friction (m ) and location of hinge pin (c), there are 
three different cases.
Case I a > m c
In this case, the friction force (mN) helps to reduce 
the magnitude of the actuating force P. It is seen 
from the free-body diagram, that the moment 
due to braking effort (P ¥ b), and moment due to 
friction force ( mN ¥ c) are both anticlockwise. Such 
a brake is called a partially ‘self-energizing’ brake. 
However, the brake is not self-locking, because a 
small magnitude of the positive force P is required 
for the braking action. This is a very desirable 
condition.
Case II a =  mc
In this case, the actuating force P is zero, as seen 
from Eq. (12.9). This indicates that no external 
force is required for the braking action. Such a 
brake is called a ‘self-locking’ brake. This is not a 
desirable condition in normal applications. Some 
positive braking effort (P) should be required to 
apply the brake, otherwise the brake will be out of 
control of the operator.
Case III a <  mc
Under this condition, the actuating force P 
becomes negative, as seen from Eq. (12.9). This 
is a dangerous operating condition, resulting in 
uncontrolled braking and grabbing. The brake is 
out of control of the operator because he cannot 
apply it.
In designing block brakes, care should be taken 
to see that the brake is not self-locking and, at 
the same time, full advantage of the partial self-
energizing effect should be taken to reduce the 
magnitude of the braking effort P. The condition to 
avoid self-locking is given by
 
a >  mc 
(12.10)
Conclusion
In order to prevent the brake arm from grabbing, 
the moment of friction force about the brake arm 
pivot (µ N c) should be less than the moment of 
brake effort about the pivot (Pb).
The above analysis was based on three 
assumptions and the third assumption was that the 
brake drum is rotating in a clockwise direction. 
Let us consider the free-body diagram of forces 
when the brake drum rotates in an anti-clockwise 
direction. It is illustrated in Fig. 12.4. Taking 
moment of forces acting on the lever about the 
hinge point O,
P ¥ b –N ¥ a – µN ¥ c = 0
or P

Fig. 12.4 Free-body Diagram (Anti-clockwise Rotation)
Therefore, the braking effort (P) also depends 
upon the direction of rotation of the brake drum. 
Obviously, for anti-clockwise rotation, the actuating 
force or braking effort (P) is more than that of 
clockwise rotation, which is given by Eq. (12.9). 
In design, the objective will be smaller values of 
braking effort.
Brakes 477
It is observed from the above analysis that the 
percentage of total brake effort that results from 
self-energizing action depends upon the following 
three factors:
 
(i) The location of pivot for the brake lever or 
brake arm, namely, dimensions a and c
 (ii) The coefﬁ cient of friction (m)
 (iii) The direction of rotation of brake drum
The main disadvantage of the block brake is the 
tendency of the brake drum shaft to bend under the 
action of normal reaction. The remedy is to use 
two symmetrical blocks at the opposite sides of the 
brake drum.
Example 12.4 A single block brake with a torque 
capacity of 250 N-m is shown in Fig. 12.5(a). The 
brake drum rotates at 100 rpm and the coefﬁ cient 
of friction is 0.35. Calculate
 
(i) the actuating force and the hinge-pin 
reaction for clockwise rotation of the drum;
 (ii) the actuating force and hinge-pin reaction 
for anticlockwise rotation of the drum;
 (iii) the rate of heat generated during the braking 
action; and
Fig. 12.5
 (iv) the dimensions of the block, if the intensity of

Similarly, taking moment of forces about the pin

Example 12.6 
A block brake with a short shoe 
is shown in Fig. 12.8. It is to be designed so that 
the product pv is limited to 2.
where,
p = normal pressure between friction lining and  
 
the brake drum (N/mm2)
v = peripheral velocity of brake drum (m/s)
The coefﬁ cient of friction between the brake 
drum and the friction lining is 0.2. The cable drum 
is connected to the brake drum by means of a pair 
of spur gears. The brake drum rotates four times as 
fast as the cable drum. The permissible intensity of 
pressure on friction lining is 1 N/mm2. Calculate:
 
(i) The magnitude of the brake shoe force (P)
 (ii) The area of friction lining
 (iii) The uniform velocity at which the mass can 
be lowered. What happens at higher speeds?

Solution
 Given (pv) = 2 m = 0.2  pmax. = 1 N/mm2
Step I Brake shoe force 
The following notations are used in this example: 
 
n1 = speed of rotation of cable drum (rpm)
 
n2 = speed of rotation of brake drum (rpm)
 (Mt)1 = torque on cable drum (N-mm)
 (Mt)2 = torque on brake drum (N-mm)
 
v1 = peripheral velocity of cable drum (m/s).
 
  It is also the velocity with which the mass 
 
  is lowered
 
v2 = peripheral velocity of brake drum (m/s) 
The brake drum rotates four times as fast as the 
cable drum.

When the coefﬁ cient of friction is constant, the 
rate of heat generated is proportional to the product 
pv. Therefore, at higher speeds the brake drum will 
be overheated. 
12.4 BLOCK BRAKE WITH LONG SHOE
In the previous section, a block brake with short 
shoe was discussed. The angle of contact between 
the block and brake drum in such cases is usually 
small and less than 45°. It is, therefore, reasonable 
to assume that the normal reaction (N) and frictional 
force (m N) are concentrated at the midpoint of the 
shoe. This assumption is not applicable for the 
brake with the long shoe. A block brake with long 
shoe is shown in Fig. 12.9. The semi-block angle 
Fig. 12.9 Block Brake with Long Shoe
is denoted by q. It is one half of the total angle 
of the contacting surface of block with the drum.
An element of friction lining, located at an 
angle (f) and subtending an angle (df) is shown in
Fig. 12.10. The area of the element is (Rdfw), 
where w is the width of the friction lining 
parallel to the axis of the brake drum. If the 
intensity of pressure at the element is p, the 
normal reaction dN on the element is given by
 
dN = (Rdfw)p 
(a)
Fig. 12.10
The force of friction on the elementary area is 
given by,
 
µdN = µ(Rdfw)p 
(b)
The torque transmitted by the force of friction 
on the elementary area is given by,
 
dMt = µdNR = m(R2dfw)p 
(c)
 
Mt = µR2w

(d)
Since the brake drum is made of a hard material 
like cast iron or steel, the wear occurs on the 
friction lining, which is attached to the block. As 
shown in Fig. 12.11, the block or the lining will 
retain the cylindrical shape of the brake drum when 
wear occurs. After the radial wear takes place, 
a point such as Y¢ moves to Y due to the force P 
on the actuating lever and maintains contact 
of the lining on block with the brake drum. In
Brakes 481
Fig. 12.11(b), (dy) is the wear in the Y direction
and (dr) is the wear in the radial direction. If it is 
assumed that the block is constrained to move in the 
Y direction towards the brake drum to compensate 
Fig. 12.11 Wear on Friction Lining
for wear, (dy) should be constant because it is same 
for all points. Therefore,
 
d
d
f
y
r
= cos
= constant 
  (e)
The radial wear (dr) is proportional to the work 
done by the frictional force. The work done by the 
frictional force depends upon the frictional force ( mN) 
and the rubbing velocity. Since the rubbing velocity is 
constant for all points on the friction lining,
 
dr µ mdN
Substituting in the expression (a),
 
dr µ µRdf wp
\ 
dr µ p 
(f)
From the expressions (e) and (f),
 
p
cosf = constant
or 
p = C1 cos f 
(g)
where C1 is the constant of proportionality. The 
pressure is maximum when f = 0. Therefore,
 
p = pmax. when f = 0°
Substituting this condition,
 
pmax. = C1 
 (h)
From Eqs (g) and (h),
 
p = pmax. cos f 
(i)
Substituting this value in Eq. (a),
 
dN = (Rdfw)pmax. cos f 
(j)
Refer to forces acting on the element of the 
friction lining as shown in Fig. 12.10(a). The 
elemental force (dN) is resolved into the following 
two components:
 
(i) Vertical component (dN cos f)
 (ii) Horizontal component (dN sin f)
The horizontal components on two sides of the 
lining will cancel each other. Therefore, the net 
force (N) is vertical and it is given by,

It is observed that the equation (p) is similar to 
Eq. (12.6) of block brake with short shoe except 
that (m) is replaced by (m¢ ).
Therefore, examples of block brakes with ‘long’ 
shoe, can be solved by using the same equations, 
which are derived for block brake with ‘short’ shoe, 
by replacing the coefﬁ cient of friction (m) by an 
equivalent coefﬁ cient of friction (m¢ ).
12.5 PIVOTED BLOCK BRAKE WITH 
LONG SHOE
When the block is rigidly ﬁ xed to the lever, the 
tendency of the frictional force (m N) is to unseat the 
block with respect to the lever as shown in Fig. 12.3. 
In case of the pivoted shoe brake, the location of the 
pivot can be selected in such a way that the moment 
of frictional force about the pivot is zero. This is the 
main advantage of the pivoted shoe brake. A double 
block brake with two symmetrical and pivoted shoes 
is shown in Fig. 12.12.
 An element of friction lining, located at an 
angle (f) and subtending an angle (df) is shown in
Fig. 12.13. The area of the element is (Rdfw), 
where w is the width of the friction lining parallel 
to the axis of the brake drum. If the intensity of 
pressure at the element is p, the normal reaction dN 
on the element is given by
 
dN = (Rdfw)p 
(a)
Fig. 12.12 Pivoted Double Block Brake
Fig. 12.13
Brakes 483
Since the brake drum is made of a hard material 
like cast iron or steel, the wear occurs on the friction 
lining, which is attached to the shoe. As shown in Fig. 
12.14, the lining will retain the cylindrical shape of the 
brake drum when wear occurs. After the radial wear 
has taken place, a point such as X¢ moves to X in order 
to maintain contact of the lining with the brake drum. 
In Fig. 12.14(b), (dx) is the wear in the X direction and 
(dr) is the wear in the radial direction. If it is assumed 
that the shoe is constrained to move towards the brake 
drum to compensate for wear, (dx) should be constant 
because it is same for all points. Therefore,

The radial wear (dr) is proportional to the work

frictional force depends upon the frictional force 
(µN) and the rubbing velocity. Since the rubbing 
velocity is constant for all points on friction lining,

From the expressions (b) and (c),

where C1 is the constant of proportionality. The 
pressure is maximum when f = 0. Substituting,
 
pmax. = C1

From Eqs (d) and (e),
 
p = pmax. cos f 
 
Substituting this value in Eq. (a),

The forces acting on the element of the friction

Pivoted shoe brakes are mainly used in hoists 
and cranes. The applications of these brakes are 
limited because of the physical problem in locating 
a pivot so close to the drum surface.
Example 12.7 
A pivoted double-block brake, 
similar to that in Fig. 12.12, has two shoes, which 
subtend an angle (2q ) of 100°. The diameter of the 
brake drum is 500 mm and the width of the friction 
lining is 100 mm. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.2 
and the maximum intensity of pressure between the 
lining and the brake drum is 0.5 N/mm2. The pivot 
of each shoe is located in such a manner that the 
moment of the frictional force on the shoe is zero. 
Calculate:
 
(i) the distance of the pivot from the axis of the 
brake drum;
 (ii) the torque capacity of each shoe; and
 (iii) the reactions at the pivot.
Solution

12.6 INTERNAL EXPANDING BRAKE
The construction of an internal expanding brake is 
shown in Fig. 12.16. It consists of a shoe, which is 
pivoted at one end and subjected to an actuating 
force P at the other end. A friction lining is ﬁ xed on 
Fig. 12.16 Internal Expanding Brake
the shoe and the complete assembly of shoe, lining 
and pivot is placed inside the brake drum. Internal 
shoe brakes, with two symmetrical shoes, are used 
on all automobile vehicles. The actuating force is 
usually provided by means of a hydraulic cylinder 
or a cam mechanism. The analysis of the internal 
shoe brake is based on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The intensity of normal pressure between 
the friction lining and the brake drum at any 
point is proportional to its vertical distance 
from the pivot.
 (ii) The brake drum and the shoe are rigid.
 (iii) The centrifugal force acting on the shoe is 
negligible.
 (iv) The coefﬁ cient of friction is constant.
The free-body diagram of forces acting on an 
element on the surface of the drum and the surface 
of friction lining is shown in Fig.12.17. It should be 
noted that angles f, q1, q2 begin with a line drawn 
from the centre of the drum to the centre of the 
pivot of the shoe. The friction material begins at an 
angle q 1 from this line and ends at an angle q2.
Consider an elemental area on the friction lining 
located at an angle f and subtending an angle df. 
The elemental area will be (Rdfw) where w is the 
width of the friction lining parallel to the axis of the 
brake drum. If p is the intensity of normal pressure 
on this elemental area, the normal reaction dN is 
given by,
 
dN = pR wdf 
(a)
Fig. 12.17 Free-body Diagram of Forces
486 Design of Machine Elements
As mentioned in the ﬁ rst assumption, the normal 
pressure p is proportional to the vertical distance (R 
sin f) of the element from the pivot. Therefore,
 
p µ sin f or p = C1 sin f 
(b)
Assuming p = pmax. when f = f max. we have,
 
pmax. = C1 sin fmax.

Considering the forces acting on the shoe and 
taking moments about the pivot,
 
P ¥ C+ Mf – Mn = 0
The couple (P ¥ C) is clockwise. The couple due 
to (dN), i.e., Mn is anticlockwise, while the couple 
due to ( m dN), i.e., Mf is clockwise. Therefore,
 
P

  (12.22)
The above equation is derived for the clockwise 
rotation of the brake drum. The direction of 
the frictional force ( mdN) is reversed for the 
anticlockwise rotation of the brake drum. In 
that case, the couple due to (m dN), i.e. Mf will be 
anticlockwise and Eq. (12.22) will be written as

  (12.23)
Let us assume that the vehicle is moving in 
the forward direction for clockwise rotation of 
Brakes 487
the brake drum. The vehicle will be travelling in 
‘reverse’ for anti-clockwise rotation of brake drum. 
The following observations are made:
 
(i) When the vehicle is moving forward 
(clockwise rotation of the brake drum), the 
couple due to actuating force (P ¥ C) and 
the couple due to friction force (m dN), i.e. 
Mf are both clockwise. Therefore, friction 
force helps to reduce the actuating force and 
consequently the force on the brake pedal is 
reduced. This is self-energizing effect [P = 
(Mn – Mf)/C].
 (ii) When the vehicle is moving in ‘reverse’ 
(anti-clockwise rotation of the brake drum), 
the couple due to actuating force (P ¥ C) and 
the couple due to friction force (m dN), i.e., 
Mf  are opposite. Therefore, friction force 
tends to increase the actuating force and 
consequently, the force on the brake pedal is 
increased [P = (Mn + Mf)/C].
 (iii) Therefore, braking action when traveling in 
‘reverse’ is not as effective as when traveling 
‘forward’.
Internal expanding brake offers the following 
advantages:
 
(i) It has simple construction with small number 
of parts. It is cheaper compared with other 
types of brakes.
 (ii) It is more reliable due to small number of 
parts.
 (iii) It requires little maintenance.
 (iv) In an internal expanding brake, a small 
actuating force can produce a large braking 
torque.
 (v) It offers protection against entry of foreign 
particles.
The disadvantages of internal expanding brake 
are as follows:
 
(i) It has relatively poor heat dissipating 
capacity.
 (ii) It becomes self-locking due to wear, if not 
properly designed.
An internal expanding brake is mainly used in 
vehicle, conveyor and hoist. A hydraulic brake 
system is usually used in an automotive brake for 
cars, trucks and buses. It uses hydraulic ﬂ uid as a 
medium for transmitting force from the brake pedal 
to the wheel brakes. Some of the guidelines for the 
design of automotive brake are as follows1:
 
(i) The maximum force exerted with the right 
foot for the ﬁ fth percentile female is 22 N and 
for the male, approximately 42 N. Therefore, 
from ergonomic considerations, the brake 
system should be designed for a maximum 
pedal force of 22 to 25 N. With booster, the 
pedal force can be as low as 11 to 17 N.
 (ii) From ergonomic considerations, the pedal 
travel should not exceed 150 mm.
 (iii) The brake system should be designed so as to 
obtain a deceleration of 1 g (i.e., 9.81 m/s2), 
when the vehicle is loaded full.
Example 12.8 
An automotive type internal-
expanding double-shoe brake is shown in Fig. 12.18. 
The face width of the friction lining is 40 mm and the 
maximum intensity of normal pressure is limited to 1 
N/mm2. The coefﬁ cient of friction is 0.32. The angle 
q 1 can be assumed to be zero. Calculate:
 
(i) the actuating force P; and
 (ii) the torque-absorbing capacity of the brake.

12.7 BAND BRAKES
The construction of a simple band brake is shown 
in Fig.12.20. It consists of a ﬂ exible steel strip lined 
with friction material, which is pressed against the 
rotating brake drum. When one end of the steel 
band passes through the fulcrum of the actuating 
lever, the brake is called the simple band brake.
Fig. 12.20 Simple Band Brake
 The working of the steel band is similar to that of 
a ﬂ at belt operating at zero velocity. The free-body 
diagram of forces acting on the band and the lever 
is shown in Fig. 12.21. The ratio of band tensions 
is given by,

where,

P2 = tension on the loose side of the band (N)
m = coefﬁ cient of friction between the friction 
 
lining and the brake drum
 
  q = angle of wrap (rad)
The torque Mt absorbed by the brake is given by,
 
Mt = (P1 – P2)R 
(12.25)
where,
Mt = torque capacity of the brake (N-mm)
R = radius of the brake drum (mm)

An element of the band subtending an angle 
(df) is shown in Fig. 12.22. The elemental area of 
the friction lining is (Rdfw), where w is the width 
of the lining parallel to the axis of the brake drum. 
In the ﬁ gure, (P) and (P + dP) are tensions in the 
band in the loose and tight sides respectively. If p is 
the intensity of pressure, the normal reaction (dN) 
is given by

Such brakes can be designed for the condition 
of self-locking. The free-body diagram of forces 
acting on the band and the lever is shown in 
Fig.12.23(b). Considering forces acting on the lever

The self-locking property is undesirable in most 
of the applications of the brake, since the brake is 
out of the operator’s control. In such a situation, 
no external force is required to apply the brake. A 
band in contact with the drum automatically grabs

and the operator cannot prevent it. In general, for 
the satisfactory operation of braking, the operator 
should exert a small but positive force. The brake 
should be applied as and when the operator requires.
Although the self-locking feature is undesirable 
in speed control brakes, it is used to advantage 
in back stop-mechanism. A back-stop brake is 
a device, which is used to prevent the reverse 
rotation of the drum when such a rotation would 
have harmful effects. The back-stop brake is a 
492 Design of Machine Elements
self-locking differential band brake illustrated in 
Fig. 12.23(a) which satisﬁ es the condition of self-
locking. With this condition, the band will lock up 
the drum for clockwise rotation. On the other hand, 
the friction tends to loosen the band and the drum 
revolves freely for anti-clockwise rotation. Should 
the rotation reverse and become clockwise, the 
rotation will stop. The back-stop brakes are popular 
in hoisting and materials handling equipment. It 
is particularly used in bucket elevator. It prevents 
the loaded buckets from reversing their direction in 
case of power failure or power shut off at the end 
of a shift.
Band brake offers the following advantages:
 
(i) Band brake has simple construction. It has 
small number of parts. These features reduce 
the cost of band brake.
 (ii) Most equipment manufacturers can easily 
produce band brake without requiring 
specialized facilities like foundry or forging 
shop. The friction lining is the only part 
which must be purchased from outside 
agencies.
 (iii) Band brake is more reliable due to small 
number of parts.
 (iv) Band brake requires little maintenance.
The disadvantages of band brake are as follows:
 
(i) The heat dissipation capacity of a band brake 
is poor.
 (ii) The wear of friction lining is uneven from 
one end to the other.
Band brakes are used in applications like bucket 
conveyors, hoists and chain saws. They are more 
popular as back-stop devices.
Example 12.10 A differential band brake is 
shown in Fig. 12.24(a). The width and the thickness 
of the steel band are 100 mm and 3 mm respectively 
and the maximum tensile stress in the band is
50 N/mm2. The coefﬁ cient of friction between 
the friction lining and the brake drum is 0.25. 
Calculate:
 
(i) the tensions in the band;
 (ii) the actuating force; and
 (iii) the torque capacity of the brake.

Example 12.11 A band brake working on the 
back-stop principle is shown in Fig. 12.25(a). The 
width of friction lining perpendicular to the axis of 
the drum is 75 mm. In normal operating condition, 
the drum rotates in clockwise direction. Calculate:
 
(i) the minimum value of coefﬁ cient of friction 
between the lining and the drum so that the 
brake acts as a back-stop brake.
 (ii) If the normal pressure between the drum and 
the lining is to be limited to 0.3 N/mm2, what 
could be the maximum braking torque?

Solution
Given  w = 75 mm pmax. = 0.3 N/mm2 
 
R = 150 mm
Step I Minimum coefﬁ cient of friction for back-stop 
brake
Refer to Fig. 12.25(b). Construct a line OB 
perpendicular to AC.
\ 
 OB ^ AC and  AE ^ OA
It is a pair of two perpendicular lines.
Since  –AOB = 30° \ –EAC = 30°
AB = OA sin (30°) = 150 sin (30°) = 75 mm
DA = DB + BA = FO + AB
 
= 150 + 75 = 225 mm
AC = AD – CD = 225 – 50 = 175 mm
EC = AC sin (30°) = 175 sin (30°) = 87.5 mm

12.8 DISK BRAKES
A disk brake is similar to a plate clutch, except that 
one of the shafts is replaced by a ﬁ xed member. 
494 Design of Machine Elements
Disk brakes can be observed on the front wheel 
of most motorcycles. A bicycle brake is another 
example of a disk brake. In this case, the wheel 
rim constitutes the disk. The friction lining on 
the caliper contacts only a small portion of the 
rim, leaving the remaining portion to dissipate 
the heat to the surrounding. Figure 12.26 shows 
the principle of disk brake. There are two pads, 
on either side of the disk, in the form of annular 
Fig. 12.26 Principle of Disk Brake  
sector. The friction lining is attached to each pad. 
A caliper attached to non-rotating member exerts 
a force P on each pad. When the pads are pressed 
against the rotating disk, the friction force between 
the surfaces of friction lining and the disk retards 
the speed and ﬁ nally stops the disk. It is seen 
that the brake pad occupies only a small portion 
of the disk, where the heat is generated due to 
friction. On the contrary, the complete surface 
area of the disk is available for dissipation of 
heat. Since a caliper is used to exert force on the 
pads, this type of brake is called ‘caliper’ disk 
brake. Since the caliper contains two pads, the 
axial forces on two sides of the disk balance each 
other and leave no thrust load on the bearings. 
Disk brakes have the following advantages:
 
(i) Disk brake is simple to install and service.
 (ii) Disk brake has high torque transmitting 
capacity in small volume.
 (iii) In drum brakes, as the temperature increases, 
the coefﬁ cient of friction decreases. Due 
to inherent ability of the disk brake to 
dissipate heat, it is insensitive to changes 
in the coefﬁ cient of friction. There is no 
mechanical ‘fade’ of friction lining. Fading 
is the loss of torque-transmitting capacity of 
friction lining at higher temperatures. 
 (iv) The disk brake is easy to control.
 (v) The brake can never become self-locking.
 (vi) The brake is equally effective for both 
directions of rotation of the disk.
 (vii) The disk brake has ‘linearity’, that is, the 
braking torque is linearly proportional to the 
actuating force.
Caliper disk brakes are used in many applications 
like front wheel of motorcycle, lift trucks, farm 
machinery and light mobile equipment.
The equations derived for single-plate clutch are 
also applicable to disk brake. However, disk brakes 
are never made with friction lining covering the 
entire circumference of the plate, because it would 
result in overheating. The braking pad presses only 
a small fraction of the circumference.
There are two types of shapes for the pads of 
caliper disk brakes, namely, annular and circular. 
The disk brake with an annular pad is illustrated in 
Fig. 12.27. The dimensions of the annular pad are 
as follows:
Ro  = outer radius of pad (mm)
Ri  = inner radius of pad (mm)
q  = angular dimension of pad (radians)
Fig. 12.27 Disk Brake with Annular Pad
Since the area of the pad is comparatively small, 
it is assumed that pressure on friction lining is 
uniform. The uniform pressure theory is discussed 
in Sectuon 11.2 of Chapter 11 on ‘Friction 
clutches’. The friction radius (Rf) for uniform 
pressure theory is given by,

as follows:

e = distance of pad centre from the axis of

The radius of the pad can be taken as 30 mm.
12.9  THERMAL CONSIDERATIONS
The energy absorbed by the brake is converted 
into heat, which increases the temperature at the 
rubbing surfaces. When the temperature increases, 
the coefﬁ cient of friction decreases, adversely 
affecting the torque capacity of the brake. At high 
temperature, there is rapid wear of the friction lining, 
which reduces the life of the lining. Therefore, the 
temperature rise should be kept within permissible 
range. The permissible temperature for different 
friction materials is given in Table 12.2.

It is very difﬁ cult to precisely calculate 
temperature rise. In preliminary design analysis, 
very often the product (pv) is considered in place of 
temperature rise. When the coefﬁ cient of friction is 
constant, the rate of heat generated is proportional 
to the product (pv) where p is the intensity of 
normal pressure (N/mm2) and v is the rubbing 
speed (m/min).
The recommended values of product (pv) are 
given in Table 12.3.

(iv) Vehicle-brakes
125
The above values are based on past experience.
Brakes 497
The temperature rise depends upon the mass of the 
brake drum assembly, the ratio of the braking period 
to the rest period and the speciﬁ c heat of the material. 
For peak short-time requirements, it is assumed that 
all the heat generated during the braking period is 
absorbed by the brake drum assembly. In that case, 
the temperature rise is given by
 
Dt
E
mc
=
 
 (12.34)
where
∆  t = temperature rise of the brake drum
 
assembly (°C)
E = total energy absorbed by the brake (J)
m = mass of the brake drum assembly (kg)
c = speciﬁ c heat of the brake drum material
 
(J/kg°C)
The actual temperature rise will be less than 
that calculated from Eq. (12.34). Some heat will be 
radiated to the atmosphere and some carried away 
by the air ﬂ ow. The equation gives approximate 
value and the actual temperature rise is obtained by 
experiments.
Example 12.14 A ﬂ ywheel of 100 kg mass and 
350 mm radius of gyration is rotating at 500 rpm. It 
is brought to rest by means of a brake. The mass of 
the brake drum assembly is 5 kg. The brake drum is 
made of cast-iron FG260(c = 460 J/kg°C ). Assuming 
that the total heat generated is absorbed by the brake 
drum only, calculate the temperature rise.

Belt Drives
Chapter 13
13.1 BELT DRIVES
Belt, chain and rope drives are called ‘ﬂ exible’ 
drives. There are two types of drives—rigid and 
ﬂ exible. Gear drives are called rigid or non-ﬂ exible 
drives. In gear drives, there is direct contact 
between the driving and driven shafts through the 
gears. In ﬂ exible drives, there is an intermediate 
link such as belt, rope or chain between the driving 
and driven shafts. Since this link is ﬂ exible, the 
drives are called ‘ﬂ exible’ drives. In gear drives, 
rotary motion of the driving shaft is directly 
converted into rotary motion of the driven shaft 
by means of pinion and gear. In ﬂ exible drives, the 
rotary motion of the driving shaft is ﬁ rst converted 
into translatory motion of the belt or chain and then 
again converted into rotary motion of the driven 
shaft. Thus, a ﬂ exible element is superimposed 
between the driving and driven elements. The 
advantages of ﬂ exible drives over rigid drives are 
as follows:
 
(i) Flexible drives transmit power over a 
comparatively long distance due to an 
intermediate link between driving and driven 
shafts.
 (ii) Since the intermediate link is long and 
ﬂ exible, it absorbs shock loads and damps 
vibrations.
 (iii) Flexible 
drives 
provide 
considerable 
ﬂ exibility in the location of the driving and 
driven shafts. The tolerances on the centre 
distance are not critical as compared with a 
gear drive.
 (iv) Flexible drives are cheap compared to gear 
drives. Their initial and maintenance costs 
are low.
The disadvantages of ﬂ exible drives are as 
follows:
 
(i) They occupy more space.
 (ii) The velocity ratio is relatively small.
 (iii) In general, the velocity ratio is not constant.
Belts are used to transmit power between two 
shafts by means of friction. A belt drive consists 
of three elements—driving and driven pulleys and 
an endless belt, which envelopes them. Belt drives 
offer the following advantages compared with other 
types of drives:
 
(i) Belt drives can transmit power over 
considerable distance between the axes of 
driving and driven shafts.
 (ii) The operation of belt drive is smooth and 
silent.
 (iii) They can transmit only a deﬁ nite load, which 
if exceeded, will cause the belt to slip over 
the pulley, thus protecting the parts of the 
drive against overload.
 (iv) They have the ability to absorb the shocks 
and damp vibration.
 (v) They are simple to design.
 (vi) They have low initial cost.
500 Design of Machine Elements
The disadvantages of belt drives compared to 
other types of drives are as follows:
 
(i) Belt drives have large dimensions and 
occupy more space.
 (ii) The velocity ratio is not constant due to belt 
slip.
 (iii) They impose heavy loads on shafts and 
bearings.
 (iv) There is considerable loss of power resulting 
in low efﬁ ciency.
 (v) Belt drives have comparatively short service 
life.
Belt drives are mainly used in electric motors, 
automobiles, machine tools and conveyors.
Depending upon the shape of the cross-section, 
belts are classiﬁ ed as ﬂ at belts and V-belts. Flat 
belts have a narrow rectangular cross-section, while 
V-belts have a trapezoidal cross-section. Flat belts 
offer the following advantages over V-belts:
 
(i) They are relatively cheap and easy to 
maintain. Their maintenance consists of 
periodic adjustment in the centre distance 
between two shafts in order to compensate 
for stretching and wear. They do not require 
precise alignment of shafts and pulleys. 
When worn out, they are easy to replace.
 (ii) A ﬂ at belt drive can be used as a clutch by 
making a simple provision of shifting the 
belt from tight to loose pulley and vice 
versa.
 (iii) Different velocity ratios can be obtained 
by using a stepped pulley, where the belt 
is shifted from one step to another, having 
different diameters.
 (iv) They can be used in dusty and abrasive 
atmosphere and require no closed casing.
 (v) The design of ﬂ at-belt drive is simple and 
inexpensive.
 (vi) They can be used for long centre distances, 
even up to 15 m.
 (vii) The efﬁ ciency of ﬂ at belt drive is more than 
V-belt drive. 
The major disadvantage of ﬂ at belt drives over 
V-belt drives are as follows:
 
(i) The power transmitting capacity of ﬂ at-belt 
drive is low.
 (ii) The velocity ratio of ﬂ at belt-drive is lower 
than V-belt drive.
 (iii) Flat-belt drives have large dimensions and 
occupy more space compared to V-belt 
drives. 
 (iv) Flat belts generate more noise than V-belts.
 (v) In general, ﬂ at-belt drives are horizontal and 
not vertical.
It is due to these reasons that ﬂ at belts are 
becoming less popular on the shop ﬂ oor. Flat belts 
are used in belt conveyors, baking machinery, brick 
and clay machinery, crushers, saw mills, textile 
machinery, line shafts and bucket elevators.
Compared with ﬂ at belts, V-belts offer the 
following advantages:
 
(i) The force of friction between the surfaces of 
the belt and V-grooved pulley is high due to 
wedge action. This wedging action permits a 
smaller arc of contact, increases the pulling 
capacity of the belt and consequently 
results in increase in the power transmitting 
capacity.
 (ii) V-belts have short centre distance, which 
results in compact construction. 
 (iii) They permit high speed-reduction even up to 
seven to one.
 (iv) Flat belts are hinged, while V-belts are 
endless which results in smooth and quiet 
operation, even at high operating speeds.
 (v) The drive is positive because the slip is 
negligible due to wedge action.
 (vi) V-belt drive can operate in any position, 
even when the belt is vertical.
The disadvantages of a V-belt drive over a ﬂ at-
belt drive are as follows:
 
(i) The ratio of the cross-sectional height to 
the pulley diameter is large in case of the V-
belt. This increases bending stresses in the 
belt cross-section and adversely affects the 
durability. 
 (ii) The efﬁ ciency of the V-belt is lower than 
that of the ﬂ at-belt and the creep is also 
higher. 
 (iii) The construction of V-grooved pulleys is 
complicated and costlier compared with 
pulleys of the ﬂ at-belt drive. 
Belt Drives 501
V-belts are very popular where an electric motor 
is used as the prime mover to drive compressors, 
pumps, fans, positive displacement pumps, blowers 
and machine tools. They are also popular in 
automobiles to drive accessories on petrol or diesel 
engines.
The velocity ratio for ﬂ at belt is up to 4:1. For 
V-belts the velocity ratio is up to 7:1. For chain 
drives it can be up to 15:1.
Flat and V-belts are widely used. However there 
are certain applications, where ‘round’ belts are used. 
The round belt is illustrated in Fig. 13.1. Round belts 
are made of leather, canvas or rubber. The diameter 
of round belts is usually from 3 mm to 12 mm. The 
minimum diameter of the smaller pulley of round 
belt is 30 times the diameter of the belt. There are
Fig. 13.1 Round Belt
two types of grooves for pulley—trapezoidal with an 
angle of 40° between the sides and half round with 
a radius equal to that of the belt. The advantages of 
round belts are as follows:
 
(i) Round belts can operate satisfactorily over 
pulleys in several different planes. They 
are suitable for 90° twist, reverse bends or 
serpentine drives. 
 (ii) They can be stretched over the pulley and 
snapped into the groove very easily. This 
makes the assembly and replacement simple.
Round belts are limited to light duties. They 
are used in dishwasher drives, sewing machines, 
vacuum cleaners and light textile machinery.
13.2 BELT CONSTRUCTIONS
The desirable properties of belt materials are as 
follows:
 
(i) The 
belt 
material 
should 
have 
high 
coefﬁ cient of friction with the pulleys.
 (ii) The belt material should have high tensile 
strength to withstand belt tensions.
 (iii) The belt material should have high wear 
resistance.
 (iv) The belt material should have high ﬂ exibility 
and low rigidity in bending in order to avoid 
bending stresses while passing over the 
pulley.
Belts are made of leather, canvas, rubber or 
rubberized fabric and synthetic materials. 
There are two types of ﬂ at belts—leather belt 
and fabric rubber belt. The leather belt is made of 
the best quality leather obtained from either sides 
of the backbone of a steer. There are two varieties 
of leather—oak-tanned and mineral or chrome-
tanned. The main advantage of leather belt is the 
high coefﬁ cient of friction and consequently, high 
power transmitting capacity. 
There is a speciﬁ c term ‘ply’ of the belt. In order 
to make a practical thick belt, the layers of belt 
material are cemented together as shown in Fig. 
13.2(a). These layers are called ‘plies’ of belt. Belts 
are speciﬁ ed according to the number of layers or 
plies, e.g., single-ply, double-ply or triple-ply belts. 
The power rating of the belt is also speciﬁ ed per ply 
of belt, e.g., the power rating of the Dunlop ‘high 
speed’ belt is 0.0118 kW per ply per mm width of 
belt.
Fig. 13.2 Flat Belts
The fabric rubber belts are made from several 
layers of canvas or cotton-duck impregnated with 
rubber as shown in Fig.13.2(b). The fabric transmits 
major portion of the load. The rubber protects the 
fabric against damage and increases the coefﬁ cient 
of friction. It is due to the presence of rubber that 
different plies of fabric work together as one belt. 
502 Design of Machine Elements
Fabric rubber belts are widely used in engineering 
industries. They offer the following advantages:
 
(i) They have high load carrying capacity.
 (ii) They have long service life.
 (iii) They can operate at high operating speeds of 
up to 300 m/s.
The disadvantages of fabric rubber belts are as 
follows:
 
(i) They cannot operate on small diameter 
pulleys. 
 (ii) They are subjected to destruction in an envi-
ronment of mineral oil, gasoline and alkalis.
Three types of construction of fabric rubber 
belts are shown in Fig.13.2(b). Type (i) is called a 
raw-edge belt. It consists of plies of fabric cut to 
the width of the belt. There are layers of rubber 
between the plies of fabric. The edges of fabric are 
protected by waterproof compound. The raw-edge 
belts are ﬂ exible. Therefore, they are widely used 
for high-speed applications and with small diameter 
pulleys. Type (ii) is called layer by layer folded 
edge belt. It consists of a central ply wrapped 
around with rectangular plies. Such belts may or 
may not have rubber layer between the plies. Type 
(iii) is called spirally wrapped folded edge belts. 
They are made of a single piece of fabric without 
any rubber layer in between. Compared with raw-
edge belts, layer by layer and spirally wrapped 
folded edge belts have edges of semicircular shape 
which is advantageous for operation on pulleys 
having ﬂ anges, for cross-belt drives and where 
belts are to be shifted.
Flat belts are produced in the form of long
bands and stored in the form of coils. The ends of 
these belts are joined by methods as illustrated in 
Fig. 13.3. There are three methods—cementing, 
lacing and by using metal fasteners.
(i) Cemented Joints Leather belts are cemented 
with a tapered lap joint of length of 20 to 25 times 
the belt thickness. Multiple ply belts are cemented in 
the form of stepped joint. Cementing is widely used 
for rubber and leather belts. The strength of cemented 
joint is 80 to 85% of the strength of the belt.
(ii) Laced Joint Lacing is done with catgut or 
with rawhide strips. The strength of a laced joint is 
50% of the strength of the belt.
(c) hinged joint
(b) laced joint
(a) cemented joint
Fig. 13.3 Flat Belt Joints
(iii) Joints with Metal Fasteners Metal fasteners 
require least time to make the joint. However, they 
are not suitable for high-speed operations. The 
strength of screwed or hinged joint is 25% of the 
strength of belt.
V-belts are made of polyester fabric and cords, 
with rubber reinforcement. The cross-section of 
the V-belt is shown in Fig. 13.4. It consists of the 
following three parts: 
Fig. 13.4 Cross-section of V-belt
 
(i) the central load carrying layers of polyester 
cords or polyester fabric, which are located 
on horizontal lines near the centre of gravity 
of the belt cross-section, 
 (ii) the surrounding layer of rubber to transmit 
force from cords to side walls, and
 (iii) outer polychloroprene impregnated elastic 
cover.
The polyester cords or fabric transmit force 
from the driving pulley to the driven pulley, which 
in turn transmit power. Since they are located near 
the neutral axis of the cross-section of the belt, 
the stresses due to bending of the belt around the 
Belt Drives 503
pulley are almost negligible. The layer of rubber 
located above the load carrying cords is subjected 
to tension and called tension layer. Similarly, the 
layer of rubber below the central cords is subjected 
to compression and called compression layer.
13.3 GEOMETRICAL RELATIONSHIPS
There are two types of belt construction—open 
and crossed as illustrated in Fig. 13.5 and 13.6 
respectively. The difference between these two 
constructions is as follows:
 
(i) An open belt drive is a belt drive in which 
the belt proceeds from the top of one pulley 
to the top of another without crossing. A 
crossed belt drive is a belt drive in which the 
belt proceeds from the top of one pulley to 
the bottom of another and crosses over itself. 
In both cases, the driving and driven shafts 
are parallel.
 (ii) In an open belt drive, both driving and 
driven pulleys rotate in the same direction. 
In a crossed belt drive, driving and driven 
pulleys rotate in the opposite direction.
 (iii) In crossed belt drive, the angle of wrap is 
more. Therefore, power transmitting capacity 
of a crossed belt drive is more than that of an 
open belt drive.
 (iv) In crossed belt drive, the belt rubs against itself 
while crossing. Also, the belt has to bend in 
two different planes. These two factors increase 
the wear and reduce the life of the belt.
 (v) In open belt drives, when the centre distance 
is more, the belt whips, i.e., vibrates in a 
direction perpendicular to the direction of 
motion. When the centre distance is small, 
the belt slip increases. Both these factors 
limit the use of an open belt drive. Crossed 
belt drives do not have these limitations.
 (vi) Open belt drives are more popular than 
crossed belt drives.
An open belt drive is shown in Fig. 13.5. The 
dimensions of the open belt drive are as follows:
as = wrap angle for small pulley (degrees)
ab = wrap angle for big pulley (degrees)
D = diameter of big pulley (mm)
d = diameter of small pulley (mm) 
C = centre distance (mm)

13.4 ANALYSIS OF BELT TENSIONS
The forces acting on the element of a ﬂ at belt are 
shown in Fig. 13.7. The following notations are 
used in the derivations:
Belt Drives 505
P1 = belt tension in the tight side (N)
P2 = belt tension in the loose side (N)
m = mass of the one meter length of belt (kg/m)
v = belt velocity (m/s)
f = coefﬁ cient of friction
a = angle of wrap for belt (radians)
Fig. 13.7 Forces on Flat Belt
An element of the belt subtending an angle (df) 
is in equilibrium under the action of the following 
forces:
 
(i) tensions (P) and (P + dP) on the loose and 
tight sides respectively;
 (ii) the normal reaction between the surfaces of 
the belt and pulley (dN) and the frictional 
force (f ¥ dN) at the interface; and
 (iii) centrifugal force in radially outward direction.
The expression for centrifugal force is given by,
 
Centrifugal force = mass ¥ acceleration 
(i)
The length of element is (rdf) and the mass per 
unit length is m. Therefore, 
 
Mass of element = mrdf 
(ii)
In the subject of Theory of Machines, the motion 
of a particle along the circular path is analysed. If a 
particle revolves with a linear velocity v at a radius 
r from the axis of rotation, the normal or centripetal 
acceleration is given by,

The superiority of V-belt over ﬂ at belt can be 
explained by comparing Eqs (13.6) and (13.7). The 
following observations are made:
 
(i) The equations of ﬂ at and V-belt are identical 
except that the coefﬁ cient of friction f
in ﬂ at belt drive is replaced by f /sin(q/2) in 
case of V-belt. In other words, the effective 
coefﬁ cient of friction in V-belt is [f /sin(q/2)] 
as compared to [ f  ] of ﬂ at belt.
 (ii) For a V-belt, q = 40° or 
 
 [f /sin (q/2)] = 2.92 f
 
 Therefore, for identical materials of belt and 
pulleys, the coefﬁ cient of friction of V-belt 
is 2.92 times that of ﬂ at belt. Consequently, 
the power-transmitting capacity of V-belt is 
much more than that of ﬂ at belt. Therefore, 
V-belts are more powerful.
 (iii) Due to increased frictional force, the slip is 
less in V-belt compared with ﬂ at belt.
The effective pull in the belt is (P1 – P2). 
Therefore,

CONDITION FOR MAXIMUM POWER
The belt is given an initial tension Pi in order to 
transmit power. The initial tension depends upon 
the length of the belt, the elasticity of the belt 
material, the geometry of pulleys and the centre 
distance. In order to derive an expression for initial 
tension, the following assumptions are made:
 
(i) The length of the belt is constant.
 (ii) The belt has linear elasticity.
When the driving pulley begins to rotate, the 
elongation on the tight side is proportional to
(P1 – Pi) while the contraction on the loose side is 
proportional to (Pi – P2). For constant belt length, 
the elongation on the tight side is equal to the 
contraction on the loose side. Therefore,
 
(P1 – Pi) = (Pi – P2)

13.6 CONDITION FOR MAXIMUM POWER

When the belt passes over the pulley, the centrifugal 
force due to its own weight tends to lift the belt 
from the surface of the pulley. An element of belt 
subtending an angle (df) at the centre of the pulley 
is shown in Fig. 13.9.

A belt can transmit maximum power when the 
following two conditions are simultaneously satisﬁ ed:
 
(i) The tension on the belt reaches the maximum 
permissible value for the belt cross-section.
 (ii) The belt is on the point of slipping, i.e., 
maximum frictional force is developed in the 
belt. 
Suppose,
b = width of belt (mm)
t = thickness of belt (mm)
s = maximum permissible tensile stress for the  
 
belt material (N/mm2)
The maximum belt tension (Pmax.) is given by,

CHARACTERISTICS OF BELT 
DRIVES
There is a peculiar phenomenon in the belt drive, 
which is called ‘creep’. Creep is a slight relative 
motion of the belt as it passes over the pulley. 
Figure 13.10 shows exaggerated mechanics of 
creep. While moving from tight to loose side over 
the pulley, the belt element is transferred from the 
zone of higher tension to the zone of lower tension. 
As the tension in the belt is reduced, the belt 
becomes shortened and creeps along the surface of 
the pulley. This causes relative motion between the 
belt and pulley surface. Creep results in a decrease 
in the angular velocity of the driven pulley from 
that calculated by considering the ratio of diameters 
of pulleys. The efﬁ ciency of the belt drive is 
reduced by 1 to 2 per cent as a result of creep.
Fig. 13.10 Belt Creep
Both creep and slip lower the expected velocity 
of the driven member. However, there is a basic 
difference between the creep and slip. Slip is 
caused by overloads and in this case, the belt slides 
over the entire arc of contact on the pulley. 
The power losses in the belt drive are made up 
of the following factors:
 
(i) Power loss due to belt creep on the pulley.
 (ii) Power loss due to internal friction between 
the particles of the belt in alternate bending 
and unbending over the pulley.
 (iii) Power loss due aerodynamic resistance to 
the motion of pulleys and belt.
 (iv) Power loss due to friction in bearings of pulleys.
The losses in V-belt drives are comparatively more 
than those of in ﬂ at belt drives, because of increased 
internal friction and creep on the pulleys. For medium 
service conditions, the efﬁ ciency of ﬂ at-belt drives is 
96% while the efﬁ ciency of V-belt is 95%. 
The ﬂ at-belt drives can be horizontal or vertical 
as illustrated in Fig. 13.11. The belt drive is said to 
be horizontal if the centres of driving and driven 
pulleys are in a horizontal line. In horizontal belt 
drives, the loose side is usually kept on the top. On 
the upper side, the sag of the belt due to its own 
weight slightly increases the arc of contact with the 
pulleys and increases the efﬁ ciency of drive. On 
the contrary, when the lower side is loose, sag will 
reduce the angle of wrap with the pulleys.

(a) Horizontal drive

(b) Vertical drive
Fig. 13.11 Horizontal and Vertical Drives
The belt drive is said to vertical if the centres of 
driving and driven pulleys are in a vertical line. As 
510 Design of Machine Elements
far as possible, vertical drives should be avoided. 
Due to gravitational force on belt, the natural 
tendency of the belt is to fall away from the lower 
surface of the lower pulley. This causes slip and 
reduces the efﬁ ciency of the drive. To run such a 
drive, the belt has to run with excessive tension 
with consequent increase in bearing reactions and 
reduced belt life.
Conclusions 
 
(i) Vertical belt drive should be avoided.
 (ii) In horizontal belt drive, the upper side 
should be loose side. 
Very often, ﬂ at belts are used between two 
non-parallel shafts. Figure 13.12 shows one such 
drive called ‘quarter-turn’ drive. The belt in this 
case should satisfy the law of belting. The law of 
belting states —‘The centreline of the belt when it 
approaches a pulley must lie in the midplane of that 
pulley’. However, a belt leaving a pulley may be 
drawn out of the midplane of that pulley. As seen 
in Fig. 13.12, the centreline of belt approaching the 
lower pulley lies in its midplane. This is also true 
for the upper pulley. It is also observed that it is not 
possible to operate the belt in the reverse direction 
without violating the law of belting. Therefore, 
for non-parallel shafts, motion is possible only in 
one direction. Otherwise, the belt is thrown off the 
pulley.
Fig. 13.12 Quarter-turn Belt Drive
Many times, it is required to decide optimum 
centre distance for the belt drive. A shorter centre 
distance is always preferred due to the following 
reasons:
 
(i) It results in compact construction.
 (ii) It is more economical.
 (iii) The operation is more stable.
However, there are two limitations for decreasing 
the centre distance, viz., the physical dimensions of 
pulleys and minimum angle of wrap to transmit a 
given power. When the centre distance is unknown, 
it is estimated by the following guidelines:
For velocity ratio less than 3,
 
C = D +1.5 d
For velocity ratio more than 3,
 
C = D 
In general, horizontal belt drives are installed 
on the shop ﬂ oor. The conditions which should be 
satisﬁ ed, when a ﬂ at-belt drive is installed are as 
follows:
 
(i) The axes of driving and driven shafts should 
be parallel.
 (ii) The centre distance between driving and 
driven shafts should be optimum.
 (iii) The upper side of the belt should be loose 
side.
Various portions of the belt are subjected to 
different stresses. The components of these stresses 
are as follows:
 
(i) Tensile stress in the belt due to initial tension 
(Pi)
 (ii) Tensile stress in the belt due to transmitted 
power (P1 or P2)
 (iii) Tensile stress in the belt due to centrifugal 
force (Pc)
 (iv) Bending stresses in the belt as it passes over 
the pulley
It is observed that maximum stress in the belt is 
induced in the tight side of belt when it passes over 
a small pulley.
Example 13.1 The layout of a leather belt drive 
transmitting 15 kW of power is shown in Fig. 13.13. 
The centre distance between the pulleys is twice 
the diameter of the bigger pulley. The belt should 
operate at a velocity of 20 m/s approximately
and the stresses in the belt should not exceed

SELECTION OF FLAT-BELTS FROM 
MANUFACTURER’S CATALOGUE
In practice, the designer has to select a belt from 
the manufacturer’s catalogue. For the selection of 
a proper belt for a given application, the following 
information is required:
 
(i) power to be transmitted;
 (ii) the input and the output speeds; 
 (iii) the centre distance depending upon the 
availability of space; and
 (iv) type of load.
The basic procedure for belt selection from the 
catalogue of The Dunlop Rubber Co. (India) Ltd.1 
is discussed in this section. The maximum power 
transmitted by the belt is obtained by multiplying 
the rated power by a load correction factor. The 
relationship is given by,
 
(kW)max. = Fa (kW) 
(13.17)
where,
(kW)max. = power transmitted by the belt for 
design purpose
 kW = actual power transmitted by the belt 
in a given application
Fa = load correction factor
The values of the load correction factor are 
given in Table 13.1.
Table 13.1 Load correction factor (Fa)
Type of load
Fa
 (i) Normal load
1.0
 (ii) Steady load, e.g., centrifugal pumps, 
fans, light machine tools, conveyors
1.2
 (iii) Intermittent load, e.g., heavy duty fans, 
blowers, compressors, reciprocating 
pumps, line shafts, heavy-duty machines
1.3
 (iv) Shock load, e.g., vacuum pumps, rolling 
mills, hammers, grinders
1.5
The power transmitting capacities of the belt are 
developed for 180° of arc of contact. The actual arc 
of contact will be different in different applications. 
When the arc of contact is less than 180°, there 
will be additional tension in the belt, to account 
for which a factor called ‘arc of contact factor’ 
(Fd) is used in calculations. The values of the arc 
of contact factor are given in Table 13.2. It is not 
advisable to use an arc of contact less than 150° 
for a ﬂ at belt drive. Therefore, the minimum arc of 
contact should be 150°.

There are two varieties of Dunlop transmission 
belts—HI-SPEED duck belting and FORT duck 
belting. HI-SPEED duck belting is used in general-
purpose applications. FORT duck belting is recom-
mended for heavy duty applications. The range of 
optimum belt velocity for these two belts is 17.8 to 
22.9 m/s. The power transmitting capacities of the 
belts are as follows:
HI-SPEED
 0.0118 kW per mm width per ply
FORT
 0.0147 kW per mm width per ply
The above values are based on the following 
two assumptions:
 1 ‘Dunlop Transmission Belting, Technical Data’ published by Dunlop Industrial Products Service, Kolkata.
Belt Drives 515
 
(i) The arc of contact is 180°.
 (ii) The belt velocity is 5.08 m/s.
There is a speciﬁ c term ‘power rating’ or ‘load 
rating’ of ﬂ at belts. Power rating of ﬂ at belt is 
deﬁ ned as the power transmitting capacity of the 
belt per mm width per ply at 180° arc of contact. 
For example, the power rating of FORT belt is 
0.0147 kW. It indicates that a single-ply Fort belt 
of 1 mm width will transmit 0.0147 kW power for 
180° arc of contact with the pulley.
The standard widths of these belts (in mm) are 
as follows:

The preferred diameters (in mm) of cast iron and 
mild steel pulleys are as follows:
100, 112, 125, 140, 160, 180, 200, 224, 250, 
280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710, 800, 
900 and 1000
The basic procedure for selection of ﬂ at belt 
consists of the following steps:
 
(i) The optimum belt velocity of Dunlop belts 
is from 17.8 to 22.9 m/s. Assume some belt 
velocity such as 18 m/s in this range and 
calculate the diameter of the smaller pulley 
by the following relationship:
 
d
v
n
= 60 1000
(
)
p
 
 where n is the input speed or rpm of the 
smaller pulley.
 
  The diameter of the bigger pulley is 
obtained by the following relationship:

=
È
ÎÍ
˘
˚˙
speed of smaller pulley

=

 Modify the values of d and D to the nearest 
preferred diameters. Determine the correct 
belt velocity for these preferred pulley 
diameters and check whether the actual 
velocity is in the range of optimum belt 
velocity.
 (ii) Determine the load correction factor Fa 
from Table 13.1. It depends upon the type 
of load. Find out the maximum power for 
the purpose of belt selection by following 
relationship,
 
(kW)max. = Fa (kW)

pulley by the following relationship:

following relationship:

belt by the following relationships:
 
 For HI-SPEED belt,

 Calculate the belt width by assuming a 
suitable number of plies. In this step, there 
are a number alternative solutions. A belt 
whose width is near the value of the standard 
width is the optimum solution. For this belt, 
select the standard belt width.

13.9 PULLEYS FOR FLAT BELTS
The pulleys for ﬂ at belts consist of three parts, 
viz., rim, hub and arms or web. The rim carries
the belt. The hub connects the pulley to the 
shaft. The arms or web join the hub with the rim.
There are two types of pulleys that are used for ﬂ at 
belts, viz., cast iron pulleys and mild steel pulleys2. 
The pulley diameters are calculated in belt drive 
design. They should comply with standard values. 
The recommended values of minimum pulley 
diameters are given in Table 13.3. The minimum 
pulley diameter depends upon the following two 
factors:
 
(i) The number of plies in the belt 
 (ii) The belt speed 
Preferred values of pulley diameters are given 
in Table 13.4. There is a relationship between the 
width of the belt and the width of the pulley, or to 
be more speciﬁ c, width of the rim of the pulley. 
The difference between the width of the rim and the 
width of the belt is given in Table 13.5. Preferred 
values for width of cast iron and mild steel pulleys 
are given in Table 13.6.

There is a speciﬁ c term, ‘crowning’ of pulley in 
ﬂ at belt drive. The thickness of the rim is slightly

518 Design of Machine Elements
increased in the centre to give it a convex or conical 
shape as shown in Fig. 13.17. This is called ‘crown’ 
of the pulley. The crown is provided only on one of 
the two pulleys. The objectives of providing crown 
are as follows:
 
(i) The crown on the pulley helps to hold the 
belt on the pulley in running condition.
 (ii)  The crown on the pulley prevents the belt 
from running off the pulley. 
 (iii) The crown on the pulley brings the belt 
to running equilibrium position near the 
midplane of the pulley. 
Fig. 13.17 Crown for Pulley
The crown on pulley is essential, particularly 
when the pulleys are mounted inaccurately or 
there is a possibility of slip due to non-parallelism 
between connected shafts. Values of crown for cast 
iron and mild steel pulleys are given in Table 13.7 
and 13.8.

 Mild steel pulleys are made of structural steels. 
The rim and the arms or web are made of low 
carbon steel, while the hub which is subjected to 
crushing stress at the keyway, is made of medium 
carbon steel. The rim is roll-formed from a steel 
plate and joined either by bolts or welded. The 
arms are made of round steel bar and welded to 
the rim. The arms are welded to the hub, if it is 
made of steel. The arms are screwed to the hub, 
if it is made of cast iron. Mild steel pulleys have 
lightweight construction compared with cast iron 
pulleys. Their proportions are shown in Fig. 13.19 
and given Table 13.10 and Table 13.11.

(a) Arrangement of arms
Pulleys up to 300 mm width are normally supplied 
with a single row of spokes. Wider pulleys requiring

13.10 ARMS OF CAST IRON PULLEY
There are three important things about the arms of 
the pulley. They are as follows:
 
(i) The arms of pulley have elliptical cross-
section.
 (ii) The major axis of elliptical cross-section is 
in the plane of rotation.
 (iii) The major axis of elliptical cross-section is 
usually twice the minor axis. 
Elliptical cross-section reduces aerodynamic 
losses during the rotation of pulley as compared 
with rectangular cross-section. Therefore invariably, 
the arms have elliptical cross-section.
The design of these arms illustrates the 
application of simple formula for bending stresses. 
It is assumed that the belt wraps around the rim of 
the pulley through approximately 180° and one-
half of the arms carry the load at any moment. This 
is illustrated in Fig. 13.20. The torque transmitted 
by the pulley is given by,

where,

P =  tangential force at the end of each arm (N)

acting on the arm is given by,

(g)
It is observed from Eqs (f) and (g) that keeping 
the minor axis in the plane of rotation increases the 
cross-sectional area. It is therefore ‘economical’ to 
keep major axis of elliptical cross-section in the 
plane of rotation. 
Example 13.5 
A pulley, made of grey cast iron 
FG 150, transmits 10 kW of power at 720 rpm. The 
diameter of the pulley is 500 mm. The pulley has 
four arms of elliptical cross-section, in which the 
major axis is twice of the minor axis. Determine 
the dimensions of the cross-section of the arm, if 
the factor of safety is 5.
Solution

Example 13.6 
A belt pulley, made of grey 
cast iron FG150, has four arms of elliptical cross-
section, in which the major axis is twice of the 
minor axis. The tensions on tight and slack sides of 
the belt are 750 and 250 N respectively. The mean 
diameter of the pulley is 300 mm, while the hub 
diameter 60 is mm. Assume that half the number 
of arms transmit torque at any time. The factor of 
safety is 5. Determine the dimensions of the cross-
section of the pulley arm near the hub.
Solution
Given P1 = 750 N P2 = 250 N D = 300 mm 
hub diameter = 60 mm Sut = 150 N/mm2 (fs) = 5

13.11 V-BELTS
The dimensions for the cross-section of V-belt are 
shown in Fig. 13.23. The following notations are 
used for the dimensions of the cross-section:
(i) Pitch Width (Wp ) It is the width of the belt  at 
its pitch zone. This is the basic dimension for 
standardisation of belt and corresponding pulley 
groove.
Fig. 13.23 Dimensions of V belt
(ii) Nominal Top Width (W) It is the top width of 
the trapezium outlined on the cross-section of the belt.
(iii) Nominal Height (T) It is the height of the 
trapezium outlined on the cross-section of the belt. 
(iv) Angle of Belt (A) It is the included angle 
obtained by extending the sides of the belt. The 
standard value of the belt angle is 40°.
(v) Pitch Length (Lp) It is the length of the pitch 
line of the belt. This is the circumferential length of 
the belt at the pitch width. 
The manufacturers and the Bureau of Indian 
Standards have standardised the dimensions of the 
cross-section3. The cross-sectional dimensions are 
given in Table 13.12. There are six basic symbols—
Z, A, B, C, D and E—for the cross-section of V-
belts. Z-section belts are occasionally used for low 
power transmission and small pulley diameters, 
while A, B, C, D and E section belts are widely used 
as general purpose belts. V-belts are designated by 
the symbol of cross-section followed by nominal 
pitch length along with symbol Lp., e.g., a V-belt 
of cross-section B and with pitch length 4430 mm 
is designated as B 4430Lp. The recommended 
values of standard pitch lengths (Lp) are given in 
Table 13.14. The groove angle for the belt is 40°. 
The groove angle for the pulley is from 34° to 38°. 
This results in wedging action between the belt 
and the groove, thereby increasing the frictional 
force, and consequently the transmitted power.

The selection of the cross-section depends upon 
two factors, namely, the power to be transmitted 
and speed of the faster shaft. Figure 13.24 shows 
the range of speed and power for various cross-
sections of the belt. Depending upon the power and 
speed of the faster pulley, a point can be plotted 
on this diagram and the corresponding cross-
section selected. In borderline cases, alternative 
design calculations are made to determine the best 
solution. 
Fig. 13.24 Selection of Cross-section of V belt
The calculations of V-belts are based on 
preferred pitch diameters of pulleys and pitch 
lengths. The series of preferred values for pitch 
diameters and pitch lengths (in mm) are given in 
Tables 13.13 and 13.14 respectively.
The number of belts required for a given appli-
cation is calculated by the following relationship:

13.12 SELECTION OF V-BELTS 
In practice, the designer has to select a V-belt from 
the catalogue of the manufacturer. The following 
information is required for the selection:
 
(i) Type of driving unit
 (ii) Type of driven machine
 (iii) Operational hours per day
 (iv) Power to be transmitted
 (v) Input and output speeds
 (vi) Approximate centre distance depending 
upon the availability of space
The basic procedure for the selection of V-belts 
consists of the following steps:
 
(i) Determine the correction factor according to 
service (Fa) from Table 13.15. It depends upon 
the type of driving unit, the type of driven 
machine and the operational hours per day.
 (ii) Calculate the design power by the following 
relationship:
 
Design power = Fa (transmitted power)

 Determine the correction factor (Fd) for 
the arc of contact from Table 13.22. It is 
not advisable to use an arc of contact less 
than 120° for V-belt drive. Therefore, the 
minimum arc of contact should be 120°.
 (x) Depending upon the type of cross-section, 
refer to the respective table from Table 13.16 
to Table 13.20 and determine the power rating 
(Pr) of single V-belt. It depends upon three 
factors—speed of faster shaft, pitch diameter 
of smaller pulley and the speed ratio.
 (xi) The last step in the selection procedure is to 
ﬁ nd out the number of belts. It depends upon 
the design power and the power transmitting 
capacity of one belt. The number of belts is 
obtained by the following relationship:
Number of belts =

13.13 V-GROOVED PULLEY
The dimensions of V-grooved pulley4 for V-belts 
are given in Table 13.23 and shown in Fig. 13.25. 
Such pulleys are usually made of grey cast iron of 
Grade-FG 250. In some applications, the pulleys 
are made of carbon steel casting. The notations 
used in the table are as follows:
lp = Pitch width of pulley groove or pitch width 
of belt. It is the width of the belt at its neutral 
axis. The line in the V-belt, whose length 
remains unchanged when the belt is deformed 
under tension, is called its neutral axis.
b = Minimum height of groove above the pitch 
line
h = Minimum depth of groove below the pitch 
line
e = Centre to centre distance of adjacent grooves.
f = Distance of the edge of pulley to ﬁ rst 
groove center
a = Groove angle
dp = Pitch diameter of pulley. It is diameter of 
the pulley measured at the pitch width of 
the groove
g = Minimum top width of the groove

sections SPZ, SPA, SPB and SPC-Speciﬁ cations. 
 (iii) Plot a point with design power as X co-
ordinate and input speed as Y co-ordinate in 
Fig. 13.24. The location of this point decides 
the type of cross-section of the belt. In a 
borderline case, such as the point located 
on the borderline of cross-sections B and C, 
alternative calculations are made to ﬁ nd out 
the best cross-section.
 (iv) Determine the recommended pitch diameter 
of the smaller pulley from Table 13.12. It 
depends upon the cross-section of the belt. 
Calculate the pitch diameter of the bigger 
pulley by the following relationship:

d
=
È
ÎÍ
˘
˚˙
speed of smaller pulley
speed of bigger pulley
 
= d

˘
˚˙
 
 The above values of D and d are compared 
with the preferred pitch diameters given in 
Table 13.13. In case of non-standard value, 
the nearest values of d and D should be 
taken from Table 13.13.

preferred pitch length L in Table 13.14. In 
case of a non-standard value, the nearest 
value of pitch length from Table 13.14 
should be taken.

Example 13.7 The following data is given for an 
open-type V-belt drive:
diameter of driving pulley = 200 mm
diameter of driven pulley = 600 mm
groove angle for sheaves = 34°
mass of belt = 0.5 kg/m
maximum permissible tension in belt = 500 N
coefﬁ cient of friction = 0.2
contact angle for smaller pulley = 157°
speed of smaller pulley = 1440 rpm
power to be transmitted = 10 kW
How many V-belts should be used, assuming 
each belt takes its proportional part of the load?
Solution
Given kW = 10 n = 1440 rpm D = 600 mm
d = 200 mm q = 34° m = 0.5 kg/m f = 0.2

Example 13.8 It is required to design a V-belt 
drive to connect a 7.5 kW, 1440 rpm induction 
motor to a fan, running at approximately 480 rpm, 
for a service of 24 h per day. Space is available for 
a centre distance of about 1 m.
Solution
Given kW = 7.5 n1 = 1440 rpm n2 = 480 rpm
C = 1 m service = 24 h per day
Step I Correction factor according to service (Fa)
In this application, an induction motor is driving a 
fan of 7.5 kW capacity for 24 hours per day. From 
Table 13.15, the correction factor according to 
service (Fa) is 1.3. 
Step II Design power
Design power = Fa (transmitted power)
 
= 1.3(7.5) = 9.75 kW
Step III Type of cross-section for belt
Plot a point with co-ordinates of 9.75 kW and 1440 
rpm speed in Fig. 13.24. It is observed that the 
point is located in the region of the B-section belt. 
Therefore, for this application, the cross-section of 
V-belt is B. 
Step IV Pitch diameter of smaller and bigger pulleys
From Table 13.12, the minimum pitch diameter for 
the smaller pulley is 200 mm. 
Speed ratio = 1440

d = 200 mm and D = 3(200) = 600 mm
It is observed from Table 13.13 that both 
diameters have preferred values.

Example 13.9 It is required to select a V-
belt drive to connect a 15 kW, 2880 rpm normal 
torque A.C. motor to a centrifugal pump, running 
at approximately 2400 rpm, for a service of 18 
hours per day. The centre distance should be 
approximately 400 mm. Assume that the pitch 
diameter of the driving pulley is 125 mm.

at 1440 rpm to a light duty compressor running at 
970 rpm. The compressor runs for 24 hours per

13.14 BELT TENSIONING METHODS
A loose belt mounted on the pulleys does not 
transmit any load. Therefore, belts are provided 
with initial tension in order to transmit power. 
When a new belt is mounted on pulleys under 
tension, it loses its initial tension due to elongation 
during its service life. Therefore, a provision 
should be made to adjust the belt tension from time 
to time. There are number of methods to adjust the 
belt tensions. They are as follows:
 
(i) When the belts are hinged or laced, a short 
length of belt is cut periodically to remove 
the slack. The belt is joined again and 
mounted on the pulleys. This is not possible 
with endless belts. 
 (ii) In the second method, the centre distance 
between the pulleys is slightly increased by 
means of an adjusting screw. The electric 
motor carrying the driving pulley moves 
with respect to the bedplate by the adjusting 
screw. 
 (iii) A device for adjusting belt tension by means 
of an idler pulley is shown in Fig. 13.26. 
The idler pulley is held against the belt by 
its own weight, in addition to an adjustable 
weight. The idler pulley should be located 
next to the small pulley on the loose side of 
the belt. The idler pulley is ﬂ at-faced without 
any crown and it can be removed from the 
belt when the machine is not working. The 
idler pulley increases the arc of contact 
and consequently the power transmitting 
capacity is also increased. 
Fig. 13.26 Idler Pulley Mechanism
 (iv) The most popular method is the Rockwood 
belt drive or the pivoted motor mounting 
as shown in Fig. 13.27. In this case, the 
belt tension is adjusted by changing the 
eccentricity e of the centre of gravity of 
the motor from the pivot. For the given 
conﬁ guration,

 where W is the weight of the motor.

13.15 RIBBED V-BELTS
Ribbed V-belts are ﬂ at belts with a series of
evenly spaced teeth on the inside of the 
circumference, which mesh with the teeth in the 
pulley or sprocket as shown in Fig. 13.28(a). 
Therefore, they can maintain exactly the same 
angular position of the driven shaft with respect to 
driving shaft. A ribbed V-belt is a positive drive. 
These belts combine the high velocity characteristic 
of the belt drive with positive power transmission 
of the chain drive. There are different names for 
ribbed V-belt, such as synchronous belt, timing belt 
or toothed belt. 
Belt Drives 541
Fig. 13.28 Ribbed V-belt
The cross-section of ribbed V-belt is shown 
in Fig. 13.28(b). It consists of the following four 
components:
 
(i) Tension members consisting of steel or ﬁ bre 
cords, for transmitting the force or load
 (ii) Rubber backing for protecting the load 
carrying tension members
 (iii) Rubber teeth for engagement with the 
sprocket
 (iv) Facing or cover, which protects the belt and 
prevents wear
There are three principle dimensions of ribbed 
V-belt, viz., pitch, pitch length and width. Pitch is 
the distance between two adjacent tooth centres 
measured along the pitch line of the belt. It is 
shown in Fig. 13.28(a). On the sprocket, pitch is 
the distance between two adjacent groove centres 
measured along the pitch circle of the sprocket. 
The pitch circle of the sprocket coincides with the 
pitch line of the belt. The pitch circle diameter of 
the sprocket is always more than the pulley face 
diameter. The pitch length is the total length of 
the belt measured along the belt pitch line. Ribbed 
V-belts are standardised on the basis of belt pitch. 
The standard pitches are as follows5:

Ribbed V-belts are selected from manufacturer’s 
catalogue like ﬂ at or V-belts.
Ribbed V-belts offer the following advantages:
 
(i) It is a positive drive; there is no slip and no 
variation in output speed.
 (ii) It has high strength to weight ratio, which 
allows for high pitch line velocities of up to 
80 m/s.
 (iii) The belt is thin and ﬂ exible, which permits 
the use of small diameter pulleys as small as 
15 mm in diameter.
 (iv) The length of the belt does not increase 
appreciably during service due to steel cords. 
Therefore, no tensioning device is required 
like ﬂ at belt drive.
 (v) The ribbed V-belt drive does not require any 
lubrication like chain drive.
 (vi) The ribbed V-belt does not require initial tension 
like ﬂ at belt. This reduces bearing reactions. 
The disadvantages of ribbed V-belt drives are as 
follows: 
 
(i) It is costly compared with ﬂ at or V-belts.
 (ii) The construction of sprocket is difﬁ cult 
compared with the pulleys for ﬂ at or V-belts.
 (iii) It is more sensitive to misalignment than V 
or ﬂ at belts.
Ribbed V-belts are used in automobiles for 
driving camshaft from an engine crankshaft. 
They are also used in business machines, sewing 
machines, portable wood working machines, timing 
devices and power transmission units.

Chain Drives
Chapter 14
14.1 CHAIN DRIVES
A chain drive consists of an endless chain
wrapped around two sprockets as shown in
Fig. 14.1. A chain can be deﬁ ned as a series of 
links connected by pin joints. The sprocket is
a toothed wheel with a special proﬁ le for the
teeth. The chain drive is intermediate between 
belt and gear drives. It has some features of belt 
Fig. 14.1 Chain Drives
drives and some of gear drives. The advantages of 
chain drives compared with belt and gear drives are 
as follows:
 
(i) Chain drives can be used for long as well as 
short centre distances. They are particularly 
suitable for medium centre distance, where 
gear drives will require additional idler 
gears. Thus, chain drives can be used over a 
wide range of centre distances. 
 (ii) As shown in Fig. 14.2, a number of shafts 
can be driven in the same or opposite 
direction by means of the chain from a single 
driving sprocket.
Fig. 14.2
 (iii) Chain drives have small overall dimensions 
than belt drives, resulting in compact unit.
 (iv) A chain does not slip and to that extent, 
chain drive is a positive drive. 
 (v) The efﬁ ciency of chain drives is high. For 
properly lubricated chain, the efﬁ ciency of 
chain drive is from 96% to 98%.
 (vi) Chain does not require initial tension. 
Therefore, the forces acting on shafts are 
reduced.
 (vii) Chains are easy to replace.
 (viii) Atmospheric conditions and temperatures do 
not affect the performance of chain drives. 
They do not present any ﬁ re hazard.
Chain Drives 545
The disadvantages of chain drives are as 
follows:
 
(i) Chain drives operate without full lubricant 
ﬁ lm between the joints unlike gears. This 
results in more wear at the joints. The wear 
increases the pitch of the chain. The chain is 
stretched out and may leave the sprocket, if 
tension is not adjusted from time to time.
 (ii) Chain drives are not suitable for non-parallel 
shafts. Bevel and worm gears and quarter-
turn belt drives can be used for non-parallel 
shafts.
 (iii) Chain drive is unsuitable where precise 
motion is required due to polygonal effect. 
The velocity of the chain is not constant 
resulting in non-uniform speed of the driven 
shaft.
 (iv) Chain drives require housing.
 (v) Compared with belt drives, chain drives 
require precise alignment of shafts. However, 
the centre distance is not as critical as in the 
case of gear drive.
 (vi) Chain drives require adjustment for slack, 
such as a tensioning device. Compared with 
the belt drive, chain drives require proper 
maintenance, particularly lubrication. 
 (vii) Chain drives generate noise. 
Chain drives are popular in the transportation 
industry, 
such 
as 
bicycle, 
motorcycle 
and 
automobile vehicle. They are used in metal and 
wood working machinery for the transmission 
of power. They are widely used in agricultural 
machinery, 
oil-well 
drilling 
rigs, 
building 
construction and materials handling equipment. 
Chain drives are used for velocity ratios less than 
10 : 1 and chain velocities of up to 25 m/s. In 
general, they are recommended to transmit power 
up to 100 kW. 
There are different types of chains. With respect 
to their purpose, chains are classiﬁ ed into the 
following three groups:
 
(i) Load lifting chains
 (ii) Hauling chains
 (iii) Power transmission chains
Load lifting chains are used for suspending, 
raising or lowering loads in materials handling 
equipment. The popular example of this category 
is a ‘link’ chain as illustrated in Fig. 14.3. Link 
chains are used in low capacity hoists, winches 
Fig. 14.3 Link Chain
and hand operated cranes. They offer the following 
advantages:
 
(i) They have good ﬂ exibility in all directions.
 (ii) Link chains can operate with small diameter 
pulleys and drums.
 (iii) They are simple to design and easy to 
manufacture.
 (iv) They produce low noise and are practically 
noiseless at low speeds of less than 0.1 m/s.
The disadvantages of link chains are as follows:
 
(i) Link chain is heavy in weight.
 (ii) It is susceptible to jerks and overloads.
 (iii) The failure of link chain is sudden and total.
 (iv) Link chains operate at low speed.
 Hauling chains are used for carrying materials 
continuously by sliding, pulling or carrying in 
conveyors. The popular example of this category is 
a ‘block’ chain as illustrated in Fig. 14.4. It consists 
of side plates of simple shapes and pins. It operates 
at medium velocities of up to 2 to 4 m/s. In general, 
hauling chains have long pitches because they 
have considerable length and mesh with sprockets 
whose size is not strictly limited. These chains are 
relatively noisy and wear rapidly because of the 
impact between the blocks and the sprocket. These 
chains are used only for conveyor applications.

Power transmission chains are used for 
transmitting power from one shaft to another. The 
546 Design of Machine Elements
discussion in this chapter is restricted to power 
transmission chains.
14.2 ROLLER CHAINS
The construction of a roller chain is shown in 
Fig. 14.5. It consists of alternate links made of 
inner and outer link plates. A roller chain consists 
of following ﬁ ve parts:
 
(i) Pin
 (ii) Bushing
 (iii) Roller
 (iv) Inner link plate
 (v) Outer link plate
Fig. 14.5 Construction of Roller Chain
The pin is press ﬁ tted to two outer link plates, 
while the bush is press ﬁ tted to inner link plates. 
The bush and the pin form a swivel joint and the 
outer link is free to swivel with respect to the 
inner link. The rollers are freely ﬁ tted on bushes 
and, during engagement, turn with the teeth 
of the sprocket wheels. This results in rolling 
friction instead of sliding friction between roller 
and sprocket teeth. The rolling friction reduces 
wear and frictional power loss and improves the 
efﬁ ciency of the chain drive. 
The inner and outer link plates are made of 
medium carbon steels. These link plates are 
blanked from cold-rolled sheets and hardened to 50 
HRC. The pins, bushes and rollers are made of case 
carburising alloy steels and hardened to 50 HRC.
The pitch (p) of the chain is the linear distance 
between the axes of adjacent rollers. Roller chains 
are standardized and manufactured on the basis 
of the pitch. These chains are available in single-
strand or multi-strand constructions such as simple, 
duplex or triplex chains as shown in Fig. 14.6. The 
dimensions and breaking load of standard chains1 
are given in Table 14.1. The roller chains are 
designated on the basis of ‘pitch’. It is designated 
in the following way.
(i) In Table 14.1, the chain number is given in 
the ﬁ rst column, e.g., 08B or 16A. It consists of two 
parts—a number followed by a letter. The number 
in two digits expresses the ‘pitch’ in sixteenths of 
an ‘inch’. The letter A means American Standard 
ANSI series and the letter B means British 
Fig. 14.6 Simple and Duplex Chains
Standard series. Most of the chain manufacturers 
are American and their ANSI series is popular in 
engineering industries.
 (a) Let us consider the designation ‘08B’.
The pitch of this chain is (08/16) inch or 
(08/16) ¥ (25.4) mm, i.e., 12.7 mm. The 
letter B indicates British standard series.
 (b) Let us consider the designation ‘16A’. 
 1 IS 2403–1991: Short pitch transmission precision Chains and Chain Wheels. 
Chain Drives 547
The pitch of this chain is (16/16) inch or 1 
inch, i.e., 25.4 mm. The letter A indicates 
American Standard ANSI series.
(ii) The chain number given in the ﬁ rst column is 
supplemented by a hyphenated sufﬁ x 1 for simple 
chain, 2 for duplex chain, 3 for triplex chain, and 
so on. For example,
08B-2 or 16A-1
These designations indicate
 (a) 08B chain with duplex construction (double 
strand)
 (b) 16A chain with simple construction (single 
strand)
There is a speciﬁ c term, breaking load, in Table 
14.1. Breaking load is deﬁ ned as the maximum 
tensile load, which if applied will result in chain 
failure. In this deﬁ nition, the failure is considered 
to have occurred at the ﬁ rst point, where increasing 
extension is no longer accompanied by increasing 
load, i.e., the limit of load-extension diagram.
The numbers given in brackets in Table 14.1 are 
equivalent and approximate chain numbers.

14.3 GEOMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS
The engagement of chain on sprocket wheel is 
shown in Fig. 14.7. D is the pitch circle diameter 
of the sprocket and a is called the pitch angle. The 
pitch circle diameter of the sprocket is deﬁ ned as 
the diameter of an imaginary circle that passes 
through the centres of link pins as the chain is 
wrapped on the sprocket.

(14.6)
where,
a = centre distance between axes of driving and 
 
driven sprockets (mm)
z1 = number of teeth on the smaller sprocket
z2 = number of teeth on the larger sprocket
The above formula is derived by analogy with 
the length of the belt. The ﬁ rst two terms represent 
the number of links when (z1 = z2) and the sides 
of the chain are parallel. The third term takes 
into consideration the inclination of the sides. It 
is obvious that the chain should contain a whole 
number of links. Therefore, the number of links 
(Ln) is adjusted to the previous or next digit so as 
to get an even number. It is always preferred to 
have an ‘even’ number of links, since the chain 
consists of alternate pairs of inner and outer link 
plates.
When the chain has an odd number of links, 
an additional link, called ‘offset’ link, is provided. 
The offset link is, however, weaker than the main 
links. After selecting the exact number of links, 
the centre to centre distance between the axes of 
the two sprockets is calculated by the following 
formula:

The above equation can be easily derived from 
Eq. (14.6). The centre distance calculated by the 
formula does not provide any sag. In practice, 
a small amount of sag is essential for the links to 
take the best position on the sprocket wheel. The 
centre distance is, therefore, reduced by a margin 
of (0.002a to 0.004a) to account for the sag.
14.4 POLYGONAL EFFECT
The chain passes around the sprocket as a series of 
chordal links. This action is similar to that of a non-
slipping belt wrapped around a rotating polygon. 
The chordal action is illustrated in Fig. 14.8, where 
the sprocket has only four teeth. It is assumed 
that the sprocket is rotating at a constant speed of 
n rpm. In Fig. 14.8(a), the chain link AB is at a 
distance of

It is evident that the linear speed of the chain

a pulsating and jerky motion. The variation in

As the number of teeth (z) increases to •, 
cos (180/z) or cos (180/•), i.e., cos (0°) will 
approach unity and (vmax. – vmin.) will become zero. 
Therefore, the variation will be zero. In order to 
reduce the variation in chain speed, the number of 
teeth on the sprocket should be increased. It has 
been observed that the speed variation is 4% for a 
sprocket with 11 teeth, 1.6% for a sprocket with 17 
teeth, and less than 1% for a sprocket with 24 teeth.
For smooth operation at moderate and high 
speeds, it is considered a good practice to use 
a driving sprocket with at least 17 teeth. From 
durability and noise considerations, the minimum 
number of teeth on the driving sprocket should be 
19 or 21. 
14.5 
POWER RATING OF ROLLER 
CHAINS
The power transmitted by the roller chain can be 
expressed by the elementary equation
 
kW = Pv
1
1000
where
P1 = allowable tension in the chain (N)
v = average velocity of chain (m/s)
However, it is not easy to determine the 
allowable tension in the chain. It depends upon a 
550 Design of Machine Elements
number of factors, such as the type of chain, pitch 
of the chain link, number of teeth on the smaller 
sprocket, chain velocity, the type of power source 
and driven machinery and the system of lubrication. 
In practice, the power rating of the roller chain is 
obtained on the basis of four failure criteria, viz., 
wear, fatigue, impact and galling.
(i) Wear The wear of the chain is caused by 
the articulation of pins in the bushings. The wear 
results in elongation of the chain, or in other words, 
the chain pitch is increased. This makes the chain 
‘ride out’ on the sprocket teeth, resulting in a faulty 
engagement. When the elongation is excessive, 
it becomes necessary to replace the chain. The 
permissible elongation for the chain is 1.5 to 2.5%. 
When the chain is properly lubricated, a layer of oil 
ﬁ lm between the contacting surfaces of the pin and 
the bushing reduces wear.
(ii) Fatigue As the chain passes around the sprocket 
wheel, it is subjected to a tensile force, which varies 
from a maximum on the tight side to a minimum 
on the loose side. The chain link is, therefore, 
subjected to one complete cycle of ﬂ uctuating 
stresses during every revolution of the sprocket 
wheel. This results in a fatigue failure of side link 
plates. For inﬁ nite life, the tensile stress should be 
lower than the endurance limit of the link plates.
(iii) Impact The engagement of rollers with 
the teeth of the sprocket results in impact. When 
excessive, this may lead to the breakage of roller 
or bushing. Increasing the number of teeth on 
the sprocket or reducing chain tension and speed 
reduces the magnitude of the impact force.
(iv) Galling Galling is a stick-slip phenomenon 
between the pin and the bushing. When the chain 
tension is high, welds are formed at the high spots 
of the contacting area. Such microscopic welds 
are immediately broken due to relative motion of 
contacting surfaces and leads to excessive wear, 
even in the presence of the lubricant.
The manufacturer’s catalogues give extensive 
details, like charts and tables, for the power rating 
of chains. They are based on the above criteria of 
chain failure. Since the chain manufacturing is a 
specialized industry, like ball and roller bearings, it 
is necessary for the designer to select a proper chain 
from these catalogues. Table 14.2 gives values of 
power rating for simple (single-strand) roller chains. 
These values are based on the assumption that 
there are 17 teeth on the driving sprocket wheel.

be transmitted. The power rating in Table 14.2 is 
based on 17 teeth on the driving wheel. In a given 
application, the number of teeth on the driving 
wheel can be less than or more than 17. The tooth 
correction factor K2 accounts for this variation. 
Similarly, the values of the power rating given in 
Table 14.2 are based on the assumption that the 
chain has a single strand. There are duplex and 
triplex chains too. This variation in the number of 
strands is taken into account by the multiple strand 
factor K1. The values of Ks, K1 and K2 are given in 
Tables 14.3, 14.4 and 14.5 respectively2.

For a satisfactory performance of roller chains, 
the centre distance between the sprockets should 
provide at least a 120° wrap angle on the smaller 
sprocket. In practice, the recommended centre 
distance is between 30 to 50 chain pitches.
Therefore, 
30p < a < 50p 
(14.9)
The expected service life of these chains is 
15,000 hours. The velocity ratio should be kept 
below 6 : 1 to get a satisfactory performance.
14.6 SPROCKET WHEELS
There are different constructions for sprocket 
wheels as shown in Fig. 14.9. Small sprockets up 
to 100 mm in diameter are usually made of a disk 
or a solid disk with a hub on one side (Fig. 14.9a
and b). They are machined from low carbon steel 
bars. Large sprockets with more than 100 mm 
diameter are either welded to a steel hub or bolted 
to a cast iron hub (Fig. 14.9c and d). In general, 
sprockets are made of low carbon or medium carbon 
steels. In certain applications, stainless steel is 
used for sprockets. When the chain velocity is less 
than 180 m/min, the teeth of the sprocket wheel are 
heat-treated to obtain a hardness of 180 BHN. For 
 2 Courtesy: Diamond Chain Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.
552 Design of Machine Elements
high speed applications, the recommended surface 
hardness is 300 to 500 BHN. The teeth are hardened 
either by carburising in case of low carbon steel or by 
quenching and tempering in case of high carbon steel.
Fig. 14.9 Construction of Sprocket Wheels
The difference between the gear and the sprocket 
is as follows:
 
(i) A gear meshes with another gear. A sprocket 
meshes with an ‘intermediate’ link, namely 
chain, which in turn meshes with another 
sprocket.
 (ii) The face width of gear is usually more with 
respect to its diameter. The sprockets are 
comparatively thin so as to ﬁ t between inner 
link plates of the chain.
 (iii) The teeth of gears have involute proﬁ le, 
while circular arcs are used for the proﬁ le of 
sprocket teeth. 
There are standard proﬁ les for the teeth of a 
sprocket wheel, as illustrated in Figs 14.10 and 
14.11. The principal dimensions of the tooth proﬁ le

14.7 DESIGN OF CHAIN DRIVE
There are two important rules in the design of a 
chain drive. They are as follows:
 
(i) The number of pitches or links of the chain 
should be always ‘even’. 
 (ii) The number of teeth on the driving sprocket 
should be always ‘odd’, such as 17, 19 or 21. 
The odd number of teeth of the sprocket, 
in combination of even number of chain links, 
facilitates uniform wear. In this combination, every 
time a new link comes in contact with a particular 
tooth on the sprocket and the wear is distributed. In 
a sprocket having even number of teeth, alternate 
teeth shows greater wear than the intermediate ones. 
Uniform wear of all teeth is particularly desirable 
when an old chain is to be replaced by a new one.
As the chain is elongated due to wear, it has a 
tendency to shift ‘outward’ upon the proﬁ les of 
sprocket teeth. Smaller the angular pitch of the 
sprocket (angle between adjacent teeth), greater 
is the outward shift. As the number of teeth on a 
sprocket increases, the angular pitch decrease and 
a small elongation of the chain leads to a large 
outward shift of the chain. In such cases, the chain 
leaves the sprocket. This outward shift limits the 
number of teeth on the sprocket. The maximum 
number of teeth on the driven sprocket is 100 to120.
Chain drives can be arranged as vertical or 
horizontal. As far as possible, vertical chain drives 
should be avoided. In case of a vertical drive, due 
to sag, the tendency of the chain is to leave the pro-
ﬁ le of teeth at the lower side of the lower sprocket. 
Therefore, vertical arrangement requires more care-
ful adjustment of chain tension in order to prevent 
the outward shift of chain. Horizontal chain drives 
are always preferred. As shown in Fig. 14.12, 
the lower strand should be the slack side. This is 
Fig. 14.12 Drive Arrangement
opposite to that of a belt drive. Keeping the driving 
or tight side on the top has the following advantages:
554 Design of Machine Elements
 
(i) The tendency of sagging portion of the chain 
to engage additional teeth on the sprocket is 
prevented.
 (ii) In case of chain drives with very long 
centre distances, the contact between the 
upper and lower strands is avoided. This is 
because the tendency of the lower strand is 
to move away from the upper strand. On the 
contrary, when the slack side is on the top, 
the tendency of the upper strand is to move 
towards the lower strands.
Conclusions
 
(i) The chain drive should be horizontal.
 (ii) The driving or tight side should be on the top.
Adequate tension in the chain is the most 
important requirement of chain drive. Chain life is 
reduced if the chain is too tight or too loose. Too 
tight a chain results in an unnecessary additional 
load in the chain and increased bearing reactions. 
Too loose a chain causes vibrations called 
‘whipping’ in the slack strand. These vibrations 
cause extra wear at the joints and induce ﬂ uctuating 
stresses in the parts of the chain.
There are two methods for adjustment of chain 
tension. They are as follows:
 
(i) Change the centre distance by moving the 
axis of one of the sprockets.
 (ii) Provide an adjustable idler sprocket.
In the ﬁ rst method, the centre distance between 
the sprockets is periodically increased by means of an 
adjusting screw. The electric motor carrying the driv-
ing sprocket moves with respect to the bedplate by the 
adjusting screw. This device is capable to compensate 
for chain elongation up to the length of two links. Af-
ter this, two links of the chain are removed and the 
chain is reassembled and reused. The second method 
of using the idler sprocket is illustrated in Fig. 14.13. 
The idler sprocket is installed on the driven (slack) 
side of the chain at a place where the sag is maximum.
Fig. 14.13 Chain Tightener
The general recommendations for the design of 
chain drive are as follows:
 
(i) The minimum number of teeth on the 
driving sprocket is 17. From durability and 
noise considerations, the minimum number 
of teeth should be 21.
 (ii) When the drive operates at low speed such as 
100 rpm, the number of teeth on the driving 
sprocket can be less than 17. In such cases, 
the number of teeth is taken as 13 or  15.
 (iii) The 
minimum 
number 
of 
teeth 
and 
consequently minimum sprocket diameter is 
sometimes restricted by the size of the shaft 
on which the driving sprocket is mounted. 
The diameter of the driving sprocket should 
be more than the shaft diameter.
 (iv) The centre distance between the axes of the 
driving and driven shafts should be between 
30 to 50 times of the pitch of the chain.
 (v) The arc of contact of the chain on the smaller 
sprocket should not be less than 120°.
 (vi) The preferred arrangement for chain drive is 
with the centrelines of sprockets horizontal. 
Also, the tight side should be on the top of 
the drive.
 (vii) The length of the chain should be in 
multiples of pitch. The exact centre distance 
should be adjusted to account for integer 
number of pitches for chain length.
 (viii) The speed reduction of a single-stage chain 
drive should not be more than 7 : 1. 
 (ix) Multi-strand chains are recommended when 
high power is to be transmitted. Overhanging 
shafts should be avoided when multi-strand 
chains are used.
 (x) Idler sprockets can be used to reduce the 
slack in the chain. When they are used, the 
idler sprocket should be kept outside the 
closed span of the chain. Also, the idler 
sprocket should be kept near to the smaller 
sprocket on the slack or loose side of the 
chain.
 (xi) The chain drive should be provided with 
a wire mesh or sheet metal guard. This is 
necessary to protect the operator as well as 
the chain drive.
Chain Drives 555
 (xii) The chain should be properly lubricated as 
per the recommendations of the manufacturer 
or the standard.
 (xiii) The expected service life of these chains is 
15 000 hours.
14.8 CHAIN LUBRICATION
The frictional losses in chain drive consists of the 
following factors:
 
(i) Loss due to friction between the rollers and 
the bushes
 (ii) Loss due to friction between bushes and pins
 (iii) Loss due to friction between the sprocket 
teeth and the rollers
The efﬁ ciency of a well lubricated chain drive is 
from 96% to 98%.
The objectives of chain lubrication are as 
follows:
 
(i) To reduce the wear of chain components
 (ii) To protect the chain against rust and corrosion
 (iii) To carry away the frictional heat
 (iv) To prevent seizure of pins and bushes
 (v) To cushion shock loads and protect the chain
There are three basic methods for the lubrication 
of chains. They are designated as Type-A, Type-
B and Type-C. The type depends upon the power 
rating and the velocity of chain. The ANSI standard 
as well as the chain manufacturers recommend a 
particular type of lubrication depending upon these 
two factors.
(i) Type-A (Manual or Drip Lubrication) In 
manual lubrication, the lubricating oil is applied 
to the chain links with a brush or an oil can after 
every eight hours of operation. The frequency of 
applying the oil should be adjusted so as to prevent 
overheating of the chain or discoloration of the 
chain joints. In drip lubrication, a drip lubricator 
continuously supplies the oil to a wick-packed 
horizontal pipe. This pipe is provided with ﬁ ne 
holes through which the oil comes out in the form 
of drops on the link plates. It is necessary to take 
precautions to avoid wind circulation in the vicinity 
of oil drops; otherwise it may result in carrying the 
oil drops in the wrong direction.
(ii) Type-B (Bath or Disk Lubrication) In bath 
lubrication, the lower side of the chain is made to 
pass through a sump containing the lubricating oil. 
The oil level should be maintained up to the pitch 
line of the chain. In disk lubrication, the entire 
chain is kept above the level of lubricating oil in 
the sump. There is a disk, which is attached to one 
of the shafts and which picks up the oil from the 
sump and deposits it onto the chain by means of a 
trough.
(iii) Type-C (Oil Stream Lubrication) In this 
method, there is a separate oil pump, which supplies 
a continuous stream of lubricating oil to the chain. 
The oil is applied on the inside of the chain loop. It 
is directed at the slack side of the chain.
Example 14.1 
A single-strand chain No. 12A 
is used in a mechanical drive. The driving sprocket 
has 17 teeth and rotates at 1000 rpm. What is the 
factor of safety used for standard power rating?

Example 14.2 A chain drive is used in a special 
purpose vehicle. The vehicle is run by a 30 kW 
rotary engine. There is a separate mechanical drive 
from the engine shaft to the intermediate shaft. The 
556 Design of Machine Elements
driving sprocket is ﬁ xed to this intermediate shaft. 
The efﬁ ciency of the drive between the engine and 
the intermediate shafts is 90%. The driving sprocket 
has 17 teeth and it rotates at 300 rpm. The driven 
sprocket rotates at 100 rpm. Assume moderate 
shock conditions and select a suitable four-strand 
chain for this drive.

11.45 kW at 300 rpm speed of driving sprocket. 
Chain No.16A (kW rating = 11.63) is suitable for 
the above application.  
Example 14.3 It is required to design a chain 
drive to connect 5 kW, 1400 rpm electric motor 
to a drilling machine. The speed reduction is 
3 : 1. The centre distance should be approximately
500 mm. 
 
(i) Select a proper roller chain for the drive.
 (ii) Determine the number of chain links.
 (iii) Specify the correct centre distance between 
the axes of sprockets.
Solution
Given kW = 5 a = 500 mm n1 = 1400 rpm
 
i = 3
Step I kW rating of chain
The number of teeth on the driving sprocket is 
selected as 21. It is further assumed that the chain 
is a simple roller chain with only one strand. 
From Table 14.3, the service factor is taken as 1.3 
assuming moderate shock conditions. For single 
strand chain, 
K1 = 1

To provide small sag, for allowing the chain 
links to take the best position on the sprocket 
teeth, the centre distance is reduced by (0.002a). 
Therefore, the correct centre distance is given by,

14.9 SILENT CHAIN
The silent or inverted-tooth chain as shown in
Fig. 14.16 consists of a series of links formed from 
laminated steel plates. Each plate has two teeth 
with a space between them to accommodate the 
mating tooth of the sprocket. The sprocket teeth 
have a trapezoidal proﬁ le. Depending upon the type 
of joint between links, the silent chains are divided 
into two groups—Reynold chain and Morse chain. 
In the Reynold chain, the links are connected by 
pins resulting in sliding friction. Rocker joints are 
used in Morse chain.
Fig. 14.16 Silent chain
Compared with roller chains, the silent chains 
can be used for high speed applications. They 
operate more smoothly and almost noiselessly. Their 
reliability is more due to laminated construction. 
They are, however, more heavier, more difﬁ cult to 
manufacture and more expensive than roller chains. 
Their applications are limited due to these reasons.

Rolling Contact
Bearings
Chapter 15
15.1 BEARINGS
Bearing is a mechanical element that permits relative 
motion between two parts, such as the shaft and the 
housing, with minimum friction. The functions of 
the bearing are as follows:
 
(i) The bearing ensures free rotation of the shaft 
or the axle with minimum friction.
 
(ii) The bearing supports the shaft or the axle 
and holds it in the correct position.
 (iii) The bearing takes up the forces that act on 
the shaft or the axle and transmits them to 
the frame or the foundation.
Bearings are classiﬁ ed in different ways. 
Depending upon the direction of force that 
acts on them, bearings are classiﬁ ed into two 
categories—radial and thrust bearings, as shown in
Fig. 15.1. A radial bearing supports the load, which 
is perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. A thrust 
Fig. 15.1 Radial and Thrust Bearings
bearing supports the load, which acts along the axis 
of the shaft.
The most important criterion to classify the 
bearings is the type of friction between the shaft 
and the bearing surface. Depending upon the type 
of friction, bearings are classiﬁ ed into two main 
groups—sliding contact bearings and rolling contact 
bearings as shown in Fig. 15.2. Sliding contact 
bearings are also called plain bearings, journal 
bearings or sleeve bearings. In this case, the surface 
of the shaft slides over the surface of the bush 
resulting in friction and wear. In order to reduce 
the friction, these two surfaces are separated by a 
ﬁ lm of lubricating oil. The bush is made of special 
bearing material like white metal or bronze. Rolling 
contact bearings are also called antifriction bearings 
or simply ball bearings. Rolling elements, such as 
balls or rollers, are introduced between the surfaces 
that are in relative motion. In this type of bearing, 
sliding friction is replaced by rolling friction. 
Sliding contact bearings are used in the following 
applications:
 
(i) crankshaft bearings in petrol and diesel 
engines;
 
(ii) centrifugal pumps;
 (iii) large size electric motors;
 (iv) steam and gas turbines; and
 
(v) concrete mixers, rope conveyors and marine 
installations.
Rolling contact bearings are used in the following 
applications:
Rolling Contact Bearings 565
 
(i) machine tool spindles;
 
(ii) automobile front and rear axles;
 (iii) gear boxes;
 (iv) small size electric motors; and
 
(v) rope sheaves, crane hooks and hoisting 
drums.
Fig. 15.2 Sliding and Rolling Contact Bearing
15.2 TYPES OF ROLLING CONTACT
 BEARINGS
For starting conditions and at moderate speeds, 
the frictional losses in rolling contact bearing 
are lower than that of equivalent hydrodynamic 
journal bearing. This is because the sliding contact 
is replaced by rolling contact resulting in low 
coefﬁ cient of friction. Therefore, rolling contact 
bearings are called ‘antifriction’ bearings. However, 
this is a misnomer. There is always friction at the 
contacting surfaces between the rolling element and 
the inner and outer cages. 
A rolling contact bearing consists of four parts—
inner and outer races, a rolling element like ball, 
roller or needle and a cage which holds the rolling 
elements together and spaces them evenly around 
the periphery of the shaft. Depending upon the type 
of rolling element, the bearings are classiﬁ ed as 
ball bearing, cylindrical roller bearing, taper roller 
bearing and needle bearing. Depending upon the 
direction of load, the bearings are also classiﬁ ed as 
radial bearing and thrust bearing. There is, however, 
no clear distinction between these two groups. 
Certain types of radial bearings can also take thrust 
load, while some thrust bearings are capable of 
taking radial loads.
The types of rolling contact bearings, which 
are frequently used, are shown in Fig. 15.3. The 
characteristics of these bearings are as follows:
(i) Deep Groove Ball Bearing The most frequently 
used bearing is the deep groove ball bearing. It is 
Fig. 15.3 Types of Rolling Contact Bearing
found in almost all kinds of products in general 
mechanical engineering. In this type of bearing, 
566 Design of Machine Elements
the radius of the ball is slightly less than the 
radii of curvature of the grooves in the races. 
Kinematically, this gives a point contact between 
the balls and the races. Therefore, the balls and 
the races may roll freely without any sliding. Deep 
groove ball bearing has the following advantages:
 
(a) Due to relatively large size of the balls, deep 
groove ball bearing has high load carrying 
capacity.
 
(b) Deep groove ball bearing takes loads in the 
radial as well as axial direction.
 
(c) Due to point contact between the balls 
and races, frictional loss and the resultant 
temperature rise is less in this bearing. The 
maximum permissible speed of the shaft 
depends upon the temperature rise of the 
bearing. Therefore, deep groove ball bearing 
gives excellent performance, especially in 
high speed applications.
 
(d) Deep groove ball bearing generates less 
noise due to point contact.
 
(e) Deep groove ball bearings are available with 
bore diameters from a few millimetres to 
400 millimetres.
The disadvantages of deep groove ball bearings 
are as follows:
 
(a) Deep groove ball bearing is not self-
aligning. Accurate alignment between axes 
of the shaft and the housing bore is required. 
 
(b) Deep groove ball bearing has poor rigidity 
compared with roller bearing. This is due 
to the point contact compared with the 
line contact in case of roller bearing. It is 
unsuitable for machine tool spindles where 
rigidity is important consideration.
(ii) Cylindrical Roller Bearing When maximum 
load carrying capacity is required in a given space, 
the point contact in ball bearing is replaced by the 
line contact of roller bearing. A cylindrical roller 
bearing consists of relatively short rollers that are 
positioned and guided by the cage. Cylindrical roller 
bearing offers the following advantages: 
 
(a) Due to line contact between rollers and 
races, the radial load carrying capacity of the 
cylindrical roller bearing is very high.
 
(b) Cylindrical roller bearing is more rigid than 
ball bearing.
 
(c) The coefﬁ cient of friction is low and frictional 
loss is less in high-speed applications.
The disadvantages of cylindrical roller bearing 
are as follows:
 
(a)  In general, cylindrical roller bearing cannot 
take thrust load.
 
(b) Cylindrical roller bearing is not self-aligning. 
It cannot tolerate misalignment. It needs 
precise alignment between axes of the shaft 
and the bore of the housing.
 
(c) Cylindrical roller bearing generates more 
noise.
(iii) Angular Contact Bearing In angular contact 
bearing, the grooves in inner and outer races are 
so shaped that the line of reaction at the contact 
between balls and races makes an angle with the axis 
of the bearing. This reaction has two components—
radial and axial. Therefore, angular contact bearing 
can take radial and thrust loads. Angular contact 
bearings are often used in pairs, either side by side 
or at the opposite ends of the shaft, in order to take 
the thrust load in both directions. These bearings 
are assembled with a speciﬁ c magnitude of pre-
load. Angular contact bearings offer the following 
advantages:
 
(a) Angular contact bearing can take both radial 
and thrust loads.
 
(b) In angular contact bearing, one side of 
the groove in the outer race is cut away to 
permit the insertion of larger number of balls 
than that of deep groove ball bearing. This 
permits the bearing to carry relatively large 
axial and radial loads. Therefore, the load 
carrying capacity of angular contact bearing 
is more than that of deep groove ball bearing.
The disadvantages of angular contact bearings 
are as follows:
 
(a) Two bearings are required to take thrust load 
in both directions.
 
(b) The angular contact bearing must be mounted 
without axial play.
 
(c) The angular contact bearing requires initial 
pre-loading.
Rolling Contact Bearings 567
(iv) Self-aligning Bearings There are two types 
of self-aligning rolling contact bearings, viz., self-
aligning ball bearing and spherical roller bearing. 
The principle of self-aligning bearing is explained 
in the next section. The self-aligning ball bearing 
consists of two rows of balls, which roll on a 
common spherical surface in the outer race. In 
this case, the assembly of the shaft, the inner race 
and the balls with cage can freely roll and adjust 
itself to the angular misalignment of the shaft. 
There is similar arrangement in the spherical roller 
bearing, where balls are replaced by two rows of 
spherical rollers, which run on a common spherical 
surface in the outer race. Compared with the self-
aligning ball bearing, the spherical roller bearing 
can carry relatively high radial and thrust loads. 
Both types of self-aligning bearing permit minor 
angular misalignment of the shaft relative to the 
housing. They are therefore particularly suitable for 
applications where misalignment can arise due to 
errors in mounting or due to deﬂ ection of the shaft. 
They are used in agricultural machinery, ventilators, 
and railway axle-boxes.
(v) Taper Roller Bearing The taper roller bearing 
consists of rolling elements in the form of a frustum 
of cone. They are arranged in such a way that the 
axes of individual rolling elements intersect in a 
common apex point on the axis of the bearing. In 
kinematics’ analysis, this is the essential requirement 
for pure rolling motion between conical surfaces. In 
taper roller bearing, the line of resultant reaction 
through the rolling elements makes an angle with 
the axis of the bearing. Therefore, taper roller 
bearing can carry both radial and axial loads. In 
fact, the presence of either component results in the 
other, acting on the bearing. In other words, a taper 
roller bearing subjected to pure radial load induces 
a thrust component and vice versa. Therefore, taper 
roller bearings are always used in pairs to balance the 
thrust component. Taper roller bearing has separable 
construction. The outer ring is called ‘cup’ and the 
inner ring is called ‘cone’. The cup is separable from 
the remainder assembly of the bearing elements 
including the rollers, cage and the cone. Taper roller 
bearings offer the following advantages:
 
(a) Taper roller bearing can take heavy radial 
and thrust loads.
 
(b) Taper roller bearing has more rigidity.
 
(c) Taper roller bearing can be easily assembled 
and disassembled due to separable parts.
The disadvantages of taper roller bearing are as 
follows:
 
(a) It is necessary to use two taper roller bearings 
on the shaft to balance the axial force.
 
(b) It is necessary to adjust the axial position of 
the bearing with pre-load. This is essential 
to coincide the apex of the cone with the 
common apex of the rolling elements.
 
(c) Taper 
roller 
bearing 
cannot 
tolerate 
misalignment between the axes of the shaft 
and the housing bore.
 
(d) Taper roller bearings are costly. 
Taper roller bearings are used for cars and trucks, 
propeller shafts and differentials, railroad axle-
boxes and as large size bearings in rolling mills.
(vi) Thrust Ball Bearing A thrust ball bearing 
consists of a row of balls running between two 
rings—the shaft ring and the housing ring. Thrust 
ball bearing carries thrust load in only one direction 
and cannot carry any radial load. The use of a 
large number of balls results in high thrust load 
carrying capacity in smaller space. This is the major 
advantage of thrust bearing. The disadvantages of 
thrust bearings are as follows:
 
(a) Thrust ball bearing cannot take radial load.
 
(b) It is not self-aligning and cannot tolerate 
misalignment.
 
(c) Their performance is satisfactory at low 
and medium speeds. At high speeds, such 
bearings give poor service because the 
balls are subjected to centrifugal forces and 
gyroscopic couple.
 
(d) Thrust ball bearings do not operate as well 
on horizontal shafts as they do on vertical 
shafts.
 
(e) Thrust ball bearing requires continuous 
pressure applied by springs to hold the rings 
together.
568 Design of Machine Elements
Thrust ball bearings are used where heavy thrust 
loads are to be carried, for example, worm gear 
boxes and crane hooks.
There are speciﬁ c materials for the parts of rolling 
contact bearings. They are as follows:
 
(a) The balls and the inner and outer races are 
made of high carbon chromium steel (SAE 
52100 or AISI 5210). It contains 1 per cent 
carbon and 1.5 per cent chromium. The balls 
and races are through-hardened to obtain a 
minimum hardness of 58 Rockwell C.
 
(b) The cages are made from stampings of low 
carbon steel.
 
(c) The rollers are made of case hardened steels 
(AISI 3310, 4620 or 8620). They are case 
carburized to obtain a surface hardness of 58 
Rockwell C.
It should be noted that balls are through hardened, 
while the rollers are case hardened.
15.3 PRINCIPLE OF SELF-ALIGNING  
 BEARING
In the previous section, two types of self-aligning 
bearings, namely, self-aligning ball bearing and 
spherical roller bearing, were explained. In many 
applications, the bearing is required to tolerate a 
small amount of misalignment between the axes 
of the shaft and the bearing. The misalignment 
may be due to deﬂ ection of the shaft under load or 
due to tolerances of individual components. Self-
aligning bearings are used in these applications. 
The principle of self-aligning bearing is illustrated 
 
Fig. 15.4 
Self aligning Bearing: (a) Shaft aligned with Bearing (b) Shaft misaligned 
with Bearing (c) Self aligning Bearing
in Fig. 15.4. A shaft perfectly aligned with the 
bearing is shown in Fig. 15.4(a). When the shaft 
is deﬂ ected under the load, it exerts pressure at 
the edges of the bearing as shown in Fig. 15.4(b). 
The edge pressure is dangerous and may result 
in undue wear and breakdown of the oil ﬁ lm. In 
self-aligning bearing, the external surface of the 
bearing bush is made spherical as shown in Fig. 
15.4(c). The centre of this spherical surface is at 
the centre of the bearing. Therefore, the bush is free 
to roll in its seat and align itself with the journal. 
Arrangement is made to provide lubricant between 
the spherical surfaces of the bush and its seat in 
order to reduce the friction. This principle is used 
in self-aligning ball bearings and spherical roller 
bearings. It is illustrated in Fig. 15.5. The angular 
misalignment a is exaggerated in the ﬁ gure. Self-
aligning bearings are commonly employed when 
accurate alignment is impossible or unfeasible.

15.4  SELECTION OF BEARING-TYPE
The selection of the type of bearing in a particular 
application depends upon the requirement of the 
application and the characteristics of different types 
of bearings. The guidelines for selecting a proper 
type of bearing are as follows:
 
(i) For low and medium radial loads, ball bearings 
are used, whereas for heavy loads and large 
shaft diameters, roller bearings are selected.
 
(ii) Self-aligning ball bearings and spherical 
roller bearings are used in applications 
where a misalignment between the axes of 
the shaft and housing is likely to exist.
 (iii) Thrust ball bearings are used for medium 
thrust loads whereas for heavy thrust 
loads, cylindrical roller thrust bearings are 
recommended. Double acting thrust bearings 
can carry the thrust load in either direction.
 (iv) Deep groove ball bearings, angular contact 
bearings and spherical roller bearings are 
suitable in applications where the load acting 
on the bearing consists of two components—
radial and thrust.
 
(v) The maximum permissible speed of the 
shaft depends upon the temperature rise in 
the bearing. For high speed applications, 
deep groove ball bearings, angular contact 
bearings and cylindrical roller bearings are 
recommended.
 (vi) Rigidity controls the selection of bearings 
in certain applications like machine tool 
spindles. Double row cylindrical roller 
bearings or taper roller bearings are used 
under these conditions. The line of contact in 
these bearings, as compared with the point 
of contact in ball bearings, improves the 
rigidity of the system.
 (vii) Noise becomes the criterion of selection in 
applications like household appliances. For 
such applications, deep groove ball bearings 
are recommended.
Knowledge of the design characteristics of 
different types of bearings and proper appreciation 
of the needs of an application enables the designer to 
select a proper type of bearing. The characteristics 
of the bearing should match with the requirements 
of the application.
15.5 STATIC LOAD CARRYING
 
 CAPACITY
Static load is deﬁ ned as the load acting on the bearing 
when the shaft is stationary. It produces permanent 
deformation in balls and races, which increases 
with increasing load. The permissible static load, 
therefore, depends upon the permissible magnitude 
of permanent deformation. From past experience, it 
has been found that a total permanent deformation 
of 0.0001 of the ball or roller diameter occurring 
at the most heavily stressed ball and race contact, 
can be tolerated in practice, without any disturbance 
like noise or vibrations. The static load carrying 
capacity of a bearing is deﬁ ned as the static load 
which corresponds to a total permanent deformation 
of balls and races, at the most heavily stressed point 
of contact, equal to 0.0001 of the ball diameter.
Formulae are given in standards1 for calculating 
the static load carrying capacity of different types of 
bearings. However, while selecting the bearings, it 
is not necessary to use these formulae. The values of 
static load carrying capacities are directly given in 
the manufacturer’s catalogues, which are based on 
the above formulae. Where conditions of friction, 
noise and smoothness are not critical, a much 
higher permanent deformation can be tolerated and 
consequently static loads up to four times the static 
load carrying capacity may be permissible. On the 
other hand, where extreme smoothness of operation 
is desired, a smaller permanent deformation is 
permitted.
15.6 STRIBECK’S EQUATION
Stribeck’s equation gives the static load capacity of 
bearing. It is based on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The races are rigid and retain their circular 
shape.
 
(ii) The balls are equally spaced.
 1 IS 3823 – 1988: Rolling Bearings—Static load ratings
570 Design of Machine Elements
 (iii) The balls in the upper half do not support 
any load.
Figure 15.6 (a) shows the forces acting on the 
inner race through the rolling elements, which 
support the static load C0. It is assumed that there is 
a single row of balls. Considering the equilibrium of 
forces in the vertical direction,
 Co = P1 + 2P2 cos b + 2P3 cos (2b) + ...... 
 (a)
 As the races are rigid, only balls are deformed. 
Suppose d1 is the deformation at the most heavily 
stressed Ball No.1. Due to this deformation, the 
inner race is deﬂ ected with respect to the outer race 
through d1. As shown in Fig. 15.6(b), the centre

15.7 DYNAMIC LOAD CARRYING   
 CAPACITY
The life of a ball bearing is limited by the fatigue 
failure at the surfaces of balls and races. The dynamic 
load carrying capacity of the bearing is, therefore, 
based on the fatigue life of the bearing. The life of 
an individual ball bearing is deﬁ ned as the number 
of revolutions (or hours of service at some given 
constant speed), which the bearing runs before the 
ﬁ rst evidence of fatigue crack in balls or races. Since 
the life of a single bearing is difﬁ cult to predict, it is 
necessary to deﬁ ne the life in terms of the statistical 
average performance of a group of bearings. Bearings 
are rated on one of the two criteria—the average life 
of a group of bearings or the life, which 90% of the 
bearings will reach or exceed. The second criterion is 
widely used in bearing industry. The rating life of a 
group of apparently identical ball bearings is deﬁ ned 
as the number of revolutions that 90% of the bearings 
will complete or exceed before the ﬁ rst evidence of 
fatigue crack. There are a number of terms used for 
this rating life. They are minimum life, catalogue life, 
L10 life or B10 life. These terms are synonyms for rating 
life. In this chapter, we will use the term L10 life. 
The life of an individual ball bearing may be 
different from rating life. Statistically, it can be 
proved that the life, which 50% of a group of bearings 
will complete or exceed, is approximately ﬁ ve times 
the rating or L10 life. This means that for the majority 
of bearings, the actual life is considerably more than 
the rated life.
The dynamic load carrying capacity of a bearing 
is deﬁ ned as the radial load in radial bearings (or 
thrust load in thrust bearings) that can be carried 
for a minimum life of one million revolutions. The 
minimum life in this deﬁ nition is the L10 life, which 
90% of the bearings will reach or exceed before 
fatigue failure. The dynamic load carrying capacity is 
based on the assumption that the inner race is rotating 
while the outer race is stationary. The formulae for 
calculating the dynamic load capacity for different 
types of bearings are given in standards2. However, 
the manufacturer’s catalogues give ready-made 
values of dynamic load capacities of bearings.
15.8 EQUIVALENT BEARING LOAD
In actual applications, the force acting on the 
bearing has two components—radial and thrust. It is 
therefore necessary to convert the two components 
acting on the bearing into a single hypothetical load, 
fulﬁ lling the conditions applied to the dynamic load 
carrying capacity. Then the hypothetical load can 
be compared with the dynamic load capacity. The 
equivalent dynamic load is deﬁ ned as the constant 
radial load in radial bearings (or thrust load in thrust 
bearings), which if applied to the bearing would 
give same life as that which the bearing will attain 
under actual condition of forces. The expression for 
the equivalent dynamic load is written as,
 
P = XVFr + YFa 
(15.2)
where,
 
P = equivalent dynamic load (N)
 
Fr = radial load (N)
 
Fa = axial or thrust load (N)
 
V = race-rotation factor 
X and Y are radial and thrust factors respectively 
and their values are given in the manufacturer’s 
catalogues.
The race-rotation factor depends upon whether 
the inner race is rotating or the outer race. The value 
 2 IS 3824–1983: Method for evaluating dynamic load ratings of rolling bearings (in four parts).
572 Design of Machine Elements
of V is 1 when the inner race rotates while the outer 
race is held stationary in the housing. The value of 
V is 1.2 when the outer race rotates with respect to 
the load, while the inner race remains stationary. In 
most of the applications, the inner race rotates and 
the outer race is ﬁ xed in the housing. Assuming V as 
unity, the general equation for equivalent dynamic 
load is given by,
 
P = XFr + YFa 
(15.3)
In this chapter, we will use the above equation 
for calculating equivalent dynamic load. The effect 
of V should be considered in special cases, where the 
outer race rotates and the inner race is stationary.

15.10 SELECTION OF BEARING LIFE
While selecting the proper size of a bearing, it is 
necessary to specify the expected life of the bearing 
for the given application. The information regarding 
the life expectancy is generally vague and values 
Rolling Contact Bearings 573
based on past experience are used. For all kinds of 
vehicles, the speed of rotation is not constant and 
the desired life is expressed in terms of millions 
of revolutions. The recommended bearing life for 
wheel applications is given in Table15.1.

In the other applications, the speed of rotation is 
relatively constant and the desired life is expressed 
in terms of hours of service. The recommended 
bearing life for some of the applications is given in 
Table 15.2.

operation (24 h per day) such 
as pumps, compressors and

The values given in the above tables are only for 
general guidance. For a particular application, the 
designer should consider the past experience, the 
difﬁ culties faced by the customer in replacing the 
bearing and the economics of breakdown costs.
15.11 LOAD FACTOR
The forces acting on the bearing are calculated by 
considering the equilibrium of forces in vertical 
and horizontal planes. These elementary equations 
do not take into consideration the effect of dynamic 
load. The forces determined by these equations are 
multiplied by a load factor to determine the dynamic 
load carrying capacity of the bearing. Load factors 
are used in applications involving gear, chain and 
belt drives. In gear drives, there is an additional 
dynamic load due to inaccuracies of the tooth proﬁ le 
and the elastic deformation of teeth. In chain and 
belt drives, the dynamic load is due to vibrations. 
The values of load factor are given in Table 15.3.

SELECTION OF BEARING FROM 
MANUFACTURER’S CATALOGUE
The basic procedure for the selection of a bearing 
from the manufacturer’s catalogue consists of the 
following steps:
 
(i) Calculate the radial and axial forces acting 
on the bearing and determine the diameter of 
the shaft where the bearing is to be ﬁ tted.
 
(ii) Select the type of bearing for the given 
application.
 (iii) Determine the values of X and Y, the radial 
and thrust factors, from the catalogue. The 
values of X and Y factors for single-row 
deep groove ball bearings are given in 
Table 15.4. The values depend upon two 
ratios,

bearing is, therefore, done by trial and error.
The static and dynamic load capacities of 
574 Design of Machine Elements
single-row deep groove ball bearings of 
different series are given in Table 15.5. To 
begin with, a bearing of light series, such as 
60, is selected for the given diameter of the 
shaft and the value of C0 is found from Table 
15.5. Knowing the ratios

the values of X and Y factors are found from

 (iv)  Calculate the equivalent dynamic load from 
the equation.
 
P = XFr + YFa 
 
(v) Make a decision about the expected bearing 
life and express the life L10 in million 
revolutions.
 (vi) Calculate the dynamic load capacity from 
the equation
 
C = P ( L10)1/3
 (vii) Check whether the selected bearing of series 
60 has the required dynamic capacity. If not, 
select the bearing of the next series and go 
back to Step (iii) and continue.
Ball bearings are thus selected by the trial and 
error procedure. The above procedure is also 
applicable to other types of bearings.

In order to explain the selection procedure, let us 
consider a numerical example. Suppose it is required 
to select a single-row deep groove ball bearing, for a 
shaft that is 75 mm in diameter and which rotates at 
125 rpm. The bearing is subjected to a radial load of 
21 kN and there is no thrust load. The expected life 
of the bearing is 10 000 hours.
Step (i)
 Fr = 21 000 N  Fa = 0 d = 75 mm
Step (ii)  Type: single-row deep groove ball 
bearing
Step (iii)  Since there is no axial load,
 
 P = Fr = 21 000 N

Step (v) C = P (L10)1/3 = 21 000 (75)1/3

Step (vi)  It is observed from Table 15.5, that 
following bearings are available with 75 mm bore 
diameter,
 No. 6015 (C = 39 700 N)
 No. 6215 (C = 66 300 N)
 No. 6315 (C = 112 000 N)
 No. 6415 (C = 153 000 N)
Therefore, bearing No. 6315 is selected for the 
above application.

While selecting a ball bearing from the 
manufacturer’s catalogue, very often a term ‘series’ 
of the bearing is used. Some manufacturers use terms 
such as light series, medium series and heavy series. 
For a given diameter of the shaft, the dimensions of 
balls and races are smaller in the light series. The 
load capacities are less and cost is also less. For 
the same shaft diameter, the dynamic load carrying 
capacity of the bearing belonging to the heavy 
series is more and the cost is also more. The trial 
and error method for the selection of a ball bearing 
begins with the light series. If that is not suitable, a 
medium series bearing is selected. The last choice is 
the costliest heavy series bearing. 
A rolling contact bearing is usually designated by 
three or four digits. The meaning of these digits is 
as follows:
 
(i) The last two digits indicate the bore diameter 
of the bearing in mm (bore diameter divided 
by 5). For example, XX07 indicates a bearing 
of 35 mm bore diameter.
 
(ii) The third digit from the right indicates the 
series of the bearing. The numbers used to 
indicate the series are as follows:
 
 Extra light series –1
 
 Light series – 2
 
 Medium series – 3
 
 Heavy series – 4
 
 For example, X307 indicates a medium 
series bearing with a bore diameter of 35 mm. 
 (iii) The fourth digit and sometimes ﬁ fth digit 
from the right speciﬁ es the type of rolling 
contact bearing. For example, the digit 6 
indicates deep groove ball bearings
Light series bearings permit smallest bearing 
width and outer diameter for a given bore diameter. 
They have lowest load carrying capacities. Medium 
series bearings have 30 to 40 per cent higher dynamic 
load carrying capacities compared with light series 
bearings of the same bore diameter. However, they 
occupy more radial and axial space. Heavy series 
bearings have 20 to 30 per cent higher dynamic load 
carrying capacities compared with medium series 
bearings of the same bore diameter.
The ISO plan for the dimension series of the 
bearing is illustrated in Fig. 15.7(a). It consists 
of two digit numbers. The ﬁ rst number indicates 
the width series 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in order 
of increasing width. The second number indicates 
the diameter series 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order of 
ascending outer diameter of the bearing. Figure 15.7(b) 
shows the proportionate dimensions of SKF bearings 
belonging to different series with a 50 mm bore 
diameter (Bearing No. 6010, 6210, 6310 and 6410).
Example 15.3 
 A single-row deep groove ball 
bearing is subjected to a pure radial force of 3 kN 
from a shaft that rotates at 600 rpm. The expected 
life L10h of the bearing is 30 000 h. The minimum 
acceptable diameter of the shaft is 40 mm. Select a 
suitable ball bearing for this application.
Solution
Given Fr = 3 kN  L10h = 30 000 h n = 600 rpm 
d = 40 mm

From Eq. (15.7), 
 
C = P (L10)1/3 = (3000)(1080)1/3 = 30 779.57 N
Step II Selection of bearing
In Table 15.5, six different bearings are available for the 
shaft diameter of 40 mm. They are 61808, 16008, 6008, 
6208, 6308 and 6408. Out of these, Bearing No. 6208 
Table 15.5 (Contd)
Rolling Contact Bearings 577
(C = 30 700 N) is suitable for the above application. 
The small difference between the expected and 
actual dynamic capacities, viz., (30 779.57 – 30 700 = 
79.57 N) is considered to be negligible.
Fig. 15.7 Dimension Series of Bearing
Example 15.4 
A single-row deep groove ball 
bearing is subjected to a radial force of 8 kN and a 
thrust force of 3 kN. The shaft rotates at 1200 rpm. 
The expected life L10h of the bearing is 20 000 h. The 
minimum acceptable diameter of the shaft is 75 mm. 
Select a suitable ball bearing for this application.
Solution
Given Fr = 8 kN Fa = 3 kN L10h = 20 000 hr 
n = 1200 rpm d = 75 mm 
Step I X and Y factors
When the bearing is subjected to radial as well as axial 
load, the values of X and Y factors are obtained from 
Table 15.4 by trial and error procedure. It is observed 
from Table 15.4, that values of X are constant and the 
values of Y vary only in case when,

In this case, the value of Y varies from 1.0 to 2.0. 
We will assume the average value 1.5 as the ﬁ rst 
trial value for the factor Y. Therefore,
X = 0.56 Y = 1.5 Fr = 8000 N Fa = 3000 N
From Eq. (15.3),
 P = XFr + YFa = 0.56(8000) + 1.5(3000) = 8980 N

From Table 15.5, it is observed that for the shaft 
of 75 mm diameter, Bearing No. 6315 (C = 112 000) 
is suitable for the above data. For this bearing,

Step III Selection of bearing
From Table 15.5, Bearing No. 6315 (C = 112 000) is 
suitable for the above application.
Example 15.5 
A transmission shaft rotating at 
720 rpm and transmitting power from the pulley P 
to the spur gear G is shown in Fig. 15.8(a). The belt 
tensions and the gear tooth forces are as follows:
P1 = 498 N P2 = 166 N Pt = 497 N Pr = 181 N
The weight of the pulley is 100 N. The diameter of 
the shaft at bearings B1 and B2 is 10 mm and 20 mm 
respectively. The load factor is 2.5 and the expected 
life for 90% of the bearings is 8000 h. Select single-
row deep groove ball bearings at B1 and B2.
Fig. 15.8
Solution
Given n = 720 rpm d1 = 10 mm d2 = 20 mm  
L10h = 8000 h load factor = 2.5
Step I Radial and axial forces
The forces acting on the shaft are shown in Fig. 15.8(b). 
Considering forces in the vertical plane and taking
also 
RV1 + RV2 = Pr + W 
or 
RV1 + 232.4 = 181 + 100
\ 
RV1 = 48.6 N          
(ii)
Considering forces in the horizontal plane and 
taking moments of forces about the bearing B1,
 
Pt (100) + (P1 + P2)(400) – RH2(250) = 0 
or 
497(100) + (498 + 166)(400) – RH2(250) = 0
\ 
RH2 = 1261.2 N        
(iii)
 
RH2 = RH1 + Pt + (P1 + P2) 
or  
1261.2 = RH1 + 497 + (498 + 166)

 RH1 = 100.2 N

The bearing reactions are in the radial direction. 
Therefore,
 
Fr1 = R1 = 111.36 N
 
Fr2 = R2 = 1282.43 N 
There is no axial thrust on these bearings; hence,
Fa1 = Fa2 = 0 
Step II Dynamic load capacities

Considering the load factor and using Eq. (15.7),
C1 = P1(L10)1/3 (Load factor)
 
= (111.36)(345.6) 1/3(2.5) = 1953.71 N
C2 = P2(L10)1/3 (Load factor)
 
= (1282.43)(345.6)1/3(2.5) = 22499.09 N 
Step III Selection of bearings
Referring to Table 15.5, the following bearings are 
available for 10 mm and 20 mm shaft diameter;
Bearing Nos. 6000 and 6404 are suitable at B1 
and B2 respectively.
Example 15.6 
A shaft transmitting 50 kW at 125 
rpm from the gear G1 to the gear G2 and mounted on 
Rolling Contact Bearings 579
two single-row deep groove ball bearings B1 and B2 
is shown in Fig. 15.9(a). The gear tooth forces are
 
Pt1 = 15915 N 
Pr1 = 5793 N 
 
Pt2 = 9549 N 
Pr2 = 3476 N
The diameter of the shaft at bearings B1 and B2 is 
75 mm. The load factor is 1.4 and the expected life 
for 90% of the bearings is 10000 h. Select suitable 
10 mm
20 mm
  (i) No. 61800 (C = 1480 N)
  (i) No. 61804 (C = 2700 N)
 (ii) No. 6000 (C = 4620 N)
 (ii) No. 16404 (C = 7020 N)
(iii) No. 6200 (C = 5070 N)

(vi) No. 6404 
(C = 30700 N)
ball bearings. 
Solution
Given kW = 50 n = 125 rpm d = 75 mm
 
L10h = 10 000 h load factor = 1.4 
Step I Radial and axial forces
The forces acting on the shaft are shown in
Fig. 15.9(b). Considering forces in the vertical plane 
and taking moments about bearing B1,
 
Pr1(125) + Pt2 (775) – RV2(625) = 0 
or 
 5793(125) + 9549(775) – RV2(625) = 0
\ 
 RV2 = 12 999 N
Considering equilibrium of vertical forces,
 
Pt2 + Pr1 = Rv2 + Rv1 
or 
9549 + 5793 = 12 999 + RV1
\ 
RV1 = 2343 N
A similar procedure is repeated for forces in the 
horizontal plane and the reactions calculated as 
follows:
 
RH1 = 11 898 N 
RH2 = 7493 N

580 Design of Machine Elements
 
= (15004)(75)1/3(1.4) = 88 584 N 
Step III Selection of bearings
From Table 15.5, the available bearings at B1 and B2 
are as follows: 
 
B1 and B2 (d = 75 mm)
 
No. 6015 (C = 39 700 N)
 
No. 6215 (C = 66 300 N)
 
No. 6315 (C = 112 000 N)
 
No. 6415 (C = 153 000 N)
Therefore, Bearing No. 6315 is suitable at B1 as 
well as B2.
Example 15.7 
A single-row deep groove ball 
bearing No. 6002 is subjected to an axial thrust 
of 1000 N and a radial load of 2200 N. Find the 
expected life that 50% of the bearings will complete 
under this condition.
Solution
Given Fa = 1000 N Fr = 2200 N
Bearing = No. 6002
Step I X and Y factors
Referring to Table 15.5, the capacities of bearing 
No. 6002 are,
 
Co = 2500 N and C = 5590 N
Also,

Step II Bearing life (L10)
P = XFr + YFa = 0.56(2200) + 1.08(1000)
 
= 2312 N
From Eq. (15.7),
 
C = P (L10)1/3   5590 = 2312 (L10)1/3 
\ 
L10 = 14.13 million rev.
Step III Bearing life (L50)
It can be proved that the life (L50), which 50% of the 
bearings will complete or exceed, is approximately 
ﬁ ve times the life L10 which 90% of the bearings 
will complete or exceed.
Therefore,
L50 = 5L10 = 5 (14.13) = 70.65 million rev.
15.13 SELECTION OF TAPER ROLLER  
 BEARINGS
The terminology related to taper roller bearings is 
slightly different from that of ball or cylindrical roller 
bearings. As mentioned in the earlier discussion, in 
taper roller bearing, the inner race is called a cone, 
and the outer race, the cup. The cup is separable from 
the remaining assembly of the bearing, consisting of 
the cone, cage and rollers. These two parts can be 
separately mounted to the housing and the journal. In 
this type of bearing, it is possible to make adjustment 
for radial clearance. There are two varieties of taper 
roller bearings involving single-row and double-
row constructions. The discussion in this chapter is 
restricted to single-row taper roller bearings.
In taper roller bearings, the line of action of the 
resultant reaction makes an angle with the axis 
of the bearing. This reaction can be resolved into 
radial and axial components. Therefore, taper roller 
bearings are suitable for carrying combined axial 
and radial loads. The conical surface of each roller 
is subjected to pressure, which acts normal to the 
surface. Therefore, even if the external force acting 
on the bearing is purely radial, it induces a thrust 
reaction within the bearing. To avoid separation 
of the cup from the cone, this thrust reaction must 
be balanced by an equal and opposite force. One 
of the methods of creating this force is to use at 
least two taper roller bearings on the same shaft. 
It such a case, the thrust reactions of two bearings 
balance each other. There are two types of popular 
construction, with two bearings on the same shaft. 
When two bearings are mounted on the shaft, with 
their backs facing each other, the mounting is said 
to be ‘back-to-back’ or indirect mounting. The 
construction, which involves two bearings with their 
Rolling Contact Bearings 581
Fig. 15.10 Axial Loading of Taper Roller Bearings
Fig. 15.11 Axial Loading of Taper Roller Bearings
fronts facing each other, is called ‘face-to-face’ or 
direct mounting. These constructions are illustrated 
in Figs 15.10 and 15.11.
The thrust component Fa created due to radial 
load Fr is approximately given by
 
F
F
Y
a
r
= 0 5.
 
 (15.10)
where Y is the thrust factor. In the preliminary stages 
of bearing selection, the value of Y is taken as 1.5. 
The equivalent dynamic load for single-row taper 
roller bearings is given by
582 Design of Machine Elements
P = Fr when (Fa/Fr) £ e 
(15.11)
P = 0.4Fr + YFa when (Fa/Fr) > e 
(15.12)
The dimensions, dynamic load carrying capacity, 
values of factor Y, value of e and designation 
of single-row taper roller bearing are given in
Table 15.6. The equations for calculating thrust load 
for various bearing arrangements and load cases are 
given in Figs 15.10 and 15.11. The equations given in 
the ﬁ gures are based on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The bearings are adjusted against each other 
to give zero clearance in operation but are 
without pre-load.
 
(ii) Bearings A and B are exactly identical (YA = 
YB = Y).
In the bearing arrangements shown in the ﬁ gures, 
the bearing A is subjected to the radial load FrA 
while bearing B to radial load FrB. Ka is the external 
axial force acting on the shaft. The radial loads FrA 
and FrB are always considered positive, even in 
cases when both act in the direction opposite to that 
shown in ﬁ gures.

Example 15.8 
A transmission shaft, transmitting 
8 kW of power at 400 rpm from a bevel gear G1 to 
a helical gear G2 and mounted on two taper roller 
bearings B1 and B2 is shown in Fig. 15.12(a). The 
gear tooth forces on the helical gear act at a pitch 
circle radius of 55 mm, while those on the bevel gear 
can be assumed to act at the large end of the tooth 
at a radius of 50 mm. The diameter of the journal 
at the bearings B1 and B2 is 40 mm. The load factor 
is 1.2 and the expected life for 90% of bearings is 
10 000 h. Bearings B1 and B2 are identical. The 
thrust force due to bevel and helical gears is taken by 
the bearing B2. Select suitable taper roller bearings 
for this application.
Solution
Given kW = 8 n = 400 rpm d = 40 mm
load factor = 1.2 L10h = 10 000 h
Step I Radial and axial forces on bearings
The forces acting on the shaft in the vertical and 
horizontal planes are shown in Fig. 15.12(b). 
Considering forces in the vertical plane and taking 
moments about the bearing B1,
3473 (150) + 439 (100) – 1319 (50) – RV2 (300) = 0
\ 
RV2 = 1663 N
Considering equilibrium of vertical forces,
 
3473 – RV1 – 1663 – 439 = 0
\ 
 RV1 = 1371 N
Considering forces in the horizontal plane and 
taking moments about the bearing B1,

is selected. With these notations,
 
FrA = 2739 N

Ka = 2794 N
Trial 1 Tentatively, we select Bearing 30208.
Referring to Table 15.6,
 
e = 0.37 and Y = 1.6
Since 
FrA < FrB and Ka > 0

 FaA /FrA = (4333.38)/(2739) = 1.58 > e
 
P = 0.4 Fr + YFa
 
= 0.4(2739) + 1.6 (4333.38) = 8029 N
 
C = P(L10)0.3 (Load factor)
 
= 8029(240)0.3 (1.2) = 49877.66 N 
Bearing 30208 (C = 58 300 N) is suitable.
Bearing B
 
FrB = 4926 N and FaB = 1539.38 N
  FaB /FrB = (1539.38)/(4926) = 0.31 < e
 
P = Fr = 4926 N
 
C = P(L10)0.3 (Load factor)
 
= 4926 (240)0.3 (1.2) = 30 601.24 N 
Bearing 30208 (C = 58 300 N) is suitable.
Example 15.9 
A machine shaft, supported on 
two identical taper roller bearings A and B, is shown 
in Fig.15.13. It is subjected to a radial force of 30 
kN and a thrust force of 10 kN. The thrust is taken 
by Bearing A alone. The shaft rotates at 300 rpm. 
The machine is intermittently used and the expected 
life L10h of the bearings is 4000 h. The minimum 
acceptable diameter of the shaft, where the bearings 
are mounted, is 60 mm. Select suitable taper roller 
bearings for the shaft.
Fig. 15.13
Solution
Given Ka = 10 kN n = 300 rpm d = 60 mm
 
L10h = 4000 h
Step I Radial and axial forces on bearings
Refer to forces acting on the shaft in the vertical 
plane as shown in Fig. 15.13. Taking moments about 
the bearing B,
FrA ¥ 300 = 30 000 ¥ 100 or FrA = 10 000 N
Taking moments about the bearing A,
FrB ¥ 300 = 30 000 ¥ 200 or FrB = 20 000 N
Also,
 
Ka = 10 000 N
Step II Tentative selection of bearing
 
FrA < FrB and Ka > 0

Therefore, Bearing No. 33112 is selected at A as

15.14 DESIGN FOR CYCLIC LOADS AND 
SPEEDS
In certain applications, ball bearings are subjected 
to cyclic loads and speeds. As an example, consider 
a ball bearing operating under the following 
conditions:
 
(i) radial load 2500 N at 700 rpm for 25% of the 
time,
 
(ii) radial load 5000 N at 900 rpm for 50% of the 
time, and
 (iii) radial load 1000 N at 750 rpm for the 
remaining 25% of the time.
Under these circumstances, it is necessary to 
consider the complete work cycle while ﬁ nding 
out the dynamic load capacity of the bearing. The 
procedure consists of dividing the work cycle into 
a number of elements, during which the operating 
conditions of load and speed are constant. 
Suppose that the work cycle is divided into x 
elements. Let P1, P2, … Px be the loads and n1, n2, 
…, nx be the speeds during these elements. During 
the ﬁ rst element, the life L1 corresponding to load 
P1, is given by

In case of bearings, where there is a combined 
radial and axial load, it should be ﬁ rst converted 
into equivalent dynamic load before the above 
computations are carried out.
Example 15.10  A single-row deep groove ball 
bearing has a dynamic load capacity of 40500 N 
and operates on the following work cycle:
 
(i) radial load of 5000 N at 500 rpm for 25% of 
the time;
 
(ii) radial load of 10000 N at 700 rpm for 50% 
of the time; and
 (iii) radial load of 7000 N at 400 rpm for the 
remaining 25% of the time.
Calculate the expected life of the bearing in 
hours.

Example 15.13 The magnitude of radial force 
acting on a ball bearing varies in a sinusoidal manner 
as shown in Fig. 15.14, while the direction remains 
ﬁ xed. Determine the equation for the variation of the 
force P against the angle of rotation q.
Fig. 15.14 Variation of force
Solution
 In order to determine the equation of the sinusoidal 
curve shown in Fig.15.14, we will use the basic 
Fig. 15.15
relationships of plane analytical geometry. Figure 
15.15 shows the following two co-ordinate systems:
 
(i) Co-ordinate system (x, y) with origin at O.
 
(ii) Co-ordinate system (x¢, y¢) with origin at O¢. 
The co-ordinates of the origin O¢ with respect 
to the origin O are (xo, yo). The relationships for 
transformation of co-ordinates with pure translation5 
are as follows:
 
x¢ = x – xo 
(a)
 
y¢ = y – yo 
(b)
Refer to the sine curve shown in Fig. 15.16. The 
equation of this curve with respect to the (x¢, y¢) co-
ordinate system is given by,

Example 15.14  A ball bearing is subjected to 
a radial force which varies in sinusoidal way as 
shown in Fig.15.14 and discussed in Ex. 15.13. 
The direction of force remains ﬁ xed. The amplitude 
of the force is 1500 N and the speed of rotation is 
720 rpm. Determine the dynamic load capacity of 
the bearing for the expected life of 8000 h.
Solution
 Given  Pmax. = 1500 N  n = 720 rpm

15.15 BEARING WITH A PROBABILITY  
 OF SURVIVAL OTHER THAN 90  
 PER CENT
In the deﬁ nition of rating life, it is mentioned that 
the rating life is the life that 90% of a group of 
identical bearings will complete or exceed before 
fatigue failure. The reliability R is deﬁ ned as,
R 
L
=
No.of bearings which havesuccessfully
completed
million revolutions
Total number of bearings under test
Therefore, the reliability of bearings selected 
from the manufacturer’s catalogue is 0.9 or 90%.
 In certain applications, where there is risk to human 
life, it becomes necessary to select a bearing having 
a reliability of more than 90%. Figure 15.17 shows 
the distribution of bearing failures. The relationship 
between bearing life and reliability is given by a 
statistical curve known as Wiebull distribution.
Fig. 15.17
Rolling Contact Bearings 593
For Wiebull distribution,
 
 R = e–(L/a)b  
 (15.16)
where R is the reliability (in fraction), L is the 
corresponding life and a and b are constants.

 (15.17)
where 
 R90 = 0.9
The values of a and b are
 
 a = 6.84  and  b = 1.17
These values are obtained from the condition,
 
 L50 = 5L10 
(15.18)
where L50 is the median life or life which 50% of 
the bearings will complete or exceed before fatigue 
failure. Equation (15.17) is used for selecting the 
bearing when the reliability is other than 90%.
 In a system, if there are a number of bearings, 
the individual reliability of each bearing should be 
fairly high. If there are N bearings in the system, 
each having the same reliability R then the reliability 
of the complete system is given by,
 
 Rs = (R)N 
(15.19)
where Rs indicates the probability of one out of N 
bearings failing during its lifetime.
Example 15.15  A single-row deep groove ball 
bearing is subjected to a radial force of 8 kN and a 
thrust force of 3 kN. The values of X and Y factors 
are 0.56 and 1.5 respectively. The shaft rotates at 
1200 rpm. The diameter of the shaft is 75 mm and 
Bearing No. 6315 (C =112 000 N) is selected for 
this application.
 
(i) Estimate the life of this bearing, with 90% 
reliability.
 
(ii) Estimate the reliability for 20 000 h life.
Solution
Given Fr = 8 kN Fa = 3 kN X = 0.56 Y = 1.5
 
n = 1200 rpm d = 75 mm C = 112 000 N
Step I Bearing life with 90% reliability
From Eq. (15.3),

15.16 NEEDLE BEARINGS
Needle bearings are characterised by cylindrical 
rollers of very small diameter and relatively long 
length. They are also called ‘quill’ bearings. The 
length to diameter ratio of needles is more than 
four. Needle bearings are used with or without inner 
and outer races as shown in Fig. 15.18. Very often, 
needle bearings are used without the races as shown 
in Fig. 15.18(a). In this case, the needles run directly 
on the surface of the shaft. The shaft is hardened 
and ground with a surface hardness of 50 HRC. This 
type of construction is suitable where limited radial 
space is available. Needle bearings offer following 
advantages:
 
(i) They have a small outer diameter. It is due to 
this reason that they are often used to replace 
sleeve bearings. This allows replacement 
with little or no changes in design.
 
(ii) They are compact and lightweight compared 
with other types of bearings.
 (iii) They have large load carrying capacity 
compared to their size.
 (iv) They have large load carrying capacity 
particularly at low peripheral speeds.
Fig. 15.18 Needle Bearings
Needle bearings are ideally suited for applications 
involving oscillatory motion such as piston pin 
bearings, rocker arms and universal joints. They are 
596 Design of Machine Elements
also suitable for continuous rotation where the load 
is variable or intermittent.
Although needle bearings are considered as a 
variety of cylindrical roller bearings, they have 
altogether different characteristics. Short roller 
bearings can be manufactured with a high degree 
of accuracy. The needles, which are considerably 
longer than their diameter, cannot be manufactured 
with the same degree of accuracy. Short rollers are 
accurately guided in their cage and races. Needles 
are not guided to that extent. This results in high 
friction in needle bearings. The coefﬁ cient of friction 
in cylindrical roller bearings is 0.0011. On the other 
hand, the coefﬁ cient of friction in needle bearings is 
0.0045 or almost four times.
15.17 BEARING FAILURE—CAUSES AND 
REMEDIES
There are two basic types of bearing failure—
breakage of parts like races or cage and the surface 
destruction. The fracture in the outer race of the ball 
bearing occurs due to overload. When the bearing is 
misaligned, the load acting on some balls or rollers 
sharply increases and may even crush them. The 
failure of the cage is caused due to the centrifugal 
force acting on the balls. The complete breakage 
of the parts of the ball bearing can be avoided by 
selecting the correct ball bearing, adjusting the 
alignment between the axes of the shaft and the 
housing and operating within permissible speeds.
In general, the failure of antifriction bearing 
occurs not due to breakage of parts but due to 
damage of working surfaces of their parts. The 
principal types of surface wear are as follows:
(i) Abrasive Wear Abrasive wear occurs when 
the bearing is made to operate in an environment 
contaminated with dust, foreign particles, rust 
or spatter. Remedies against this type of wear are 
provision of oil seals, increasing surface hardness 
and use of high viscosity oils. The thick lubricating 
ﬁ lm developed by these oils allows ﬁ ne particles to 
pass without scratching.
(ii) Corrosive Wear The corrosion of the surfaces 
of bearing parts is caused by the entry of water or 
moisture in the bearing. It is also caused due to 
corrosive elements present in the Extreme Pressure 
(EP) additives that are added in the lubricating oils. 
These elements attack the surfaces of the bearing, 
resulting in ﬁ ne wear uniformly distributed over the 
entire surface. Remedies against this type of wear 
are, providing complete enclosure for the bearing 
free from external contamination, selecting proper 
additives and replacing the lubricating oil at regular 
intervals.
(iii) Pitting Pitting is the main cause of the failure 
of antifriction bearings. Pitting is a surface fatigue 
failure which occurs when the load on the bearing 
part exceeds the surface endurance strength of the 
material. This type of failure is characterised by 
pits, which continue to grow resulting in complete 
destruction of the bearing surfaces. Pitting depends 
upon the magnitude of Hertz’ contact stress and 
the number of stress cycles. The surface endurance 
strength can be improved by increasing the surface 
hardness.
(iv) Scoring Excessive surface pressure, high 
surface speed and inadequate supply of lubricant 
result in breakdown of the lubricant ﬁ lm. This 
results in excessive frictional heat and overheating 
at the contacting surfaces. Scoring is a stick-slip 
phenomenon, in which alternate welding and 
shearing takes place rapidly at high spots. Here, 
the rate of wear is faster. Scoring can be avoided 
by selecting the parameters, such as surface speed, 
surface pressure and the ﬂ ow of lubricant in such a 
way that the resulting temperature at the contacting 
surfaces is within permissible limits.
15.18 LUBRICATION OF ROLLING  
 
CONTACT BEARINGS
The purpose of lubrication in antifriction bearings is 
to reduce the friction between balls and races. The 
other objectives are dissipation of frictional heat, 
prevention of corrosion and protection of the bearing 
from dirt and other foreign particles. There are two 
types of lubricants—oil and grease. Compared with 
grease, oil offers the following advantages:
 
(i) It is more effective in carrying frictional 
heat.
Rolling Contact Bearings 597
 
(ii) It feeds more easily into contact areas of the 
bearing under load.
 (iii) It is more effective in ﬂ ushing out dirt, 
corrosion and foreign particles from the 
bearing.
The advantages offered by grease lubricated 
bearings are simple housing design, less maintenance 
cost, better sealing against rust and less possibility 
of leakage. The guidelines for selecting the lubricant 
are as follows:
 
(i) When the temperature is less than 100°C, 
grease is suitable, while lubricating oils 
are preferred for applications where the 
temperature exceeds 100°C.
 
(ii) When the product of bore (in mm) ¥ speed 
(in rpm) is below 200 000, grease is suitable. 
For higher values, lubricating oils are 
recommended.
 (iii) Grease is suitable for low and moderate 
loads, while lubricating oils are used for 
heavy duty applications.
 (iv) If there is a central lubricating system, which 
is required for the lubrication of other parts, 
the same lubricating oil is used for bearings, 
e.g., gearboxes.
The choice of lubricating oil is necessary for 
high speed, heavy load applications, while in the 
remaining majority of applications, grease offers the 
simplest and cheapest mode of lubrication.
15.19 MOUNTING OF BEARING
The inner race of the bearing is ﬁ tted on the shaft by 
means of an interference ﬁ t. It prevents the relative 
rotation and the corresponding wear between 
the inner race and the shaft. Tolerances for shaft 
diameter, corresponding to this type of interference 
ﬁ t, are given in the manufacturer’s catalogue. Care 
should be taken to select the ﬁ t in such a way that it 
provides sufﬁ cient tightness to give a ﬁ rm mounting 
and at the same time, it is not too tight a ﬁ t to 
cause deformation of the inner race and destroying 
clearance between the rolling elements and the races. 
The outer race is also mounted in the housing with 
interference ﬁ t, but to a lesser degree of tightness 
than that of the inner race. Insufﬁ cient tightness of 
the outer race in the housing seat may cause ‘creep’. 
In bearing terminology, creep is slow rotation of the 
outer race relative to its seating. It is caused when 
the shaft is subjected to external force that rotates 
and changes its direction. When two bearings are 
mounted on the same shaft, the outer race of one 
of them should be permitted to shift axially to take 
care of axial deﬂ ection of the shaft caused either by 
thrust load or by the temperature variation.
It is necessary to position inner and outer 
races axially by positive means. There are several 
methods such as providing shoulders for the shaft 
or the housing, lock nut, snap ring or cover plates 
as shown in Fig. 15.19. The basic principle is to 
restrict the displacement of inner as well as outer 
race in axial direction by positive means. Figure 
15.19(a) shows the mounting suitable for a long and 
continuous shaft. It consists of an adapter sleeve, 
which is provided with a small taper. The bearing 
is press ﬁ tted on this adapter sleeve. Because of 
the taper, the displacement of the inner race to 
the left side is restricted. A washer and lock nut is 
provided to restrict the displacement of the inner 
race to the right side. Two methods of restricting 
the displacement of the inner race are illustrated in 
Figs. 15.19(b) and (c). In both the cases, the shaft is 
provided with a shoulder to restrict the displacement 
of the inner race to the left side. In Fig. 15.19(b), 
the displacement of the race to the right side is 
restricted by a plate, which is bolted to the shaft. 
In Fig. 15.19(c), a snap-ring is used in place of the 
plate. In Fig. 15.19(d), the housing is provided with 
a shoulder to restrict the displacement of the outer 
race to the left side. A circular ring of the cover plate 
restricts the displacement to the right side. The cover 
plate is bolted to the housing. Commercial oil seal 
unit is used to prevent the leakage of lubricating oil. 
The shoulders for the shaft and housing bore have 
standards dimension, which can be obtained from 
the manufacturer’s catalogue.
Shafts and spindles in machine tools and 
precision equipment should rotate without any play 
or clearance either in axial or radial direction. This 
is achieved by preloading the ball bearings. The 
objective of preloading is to remove the internal 
598 Design of Machine Elements
clearance usually found in the bearing. Preloading 
of cylindrical roller bearing is obtained by the 
following methods:
 
(i) The roller bearing is mounted on a taper 
shaft or sleeve, which causes the inner race 
to expand and remove the radial clearance.
 
(ii) The outer race is ﬁ tted in the housing bore 
by an interference ﬁ t. It causes the outer race 
to contract and remove the radial clearance.
Fig. 15.19 Mountings of Bearing
Ball bearings, such as angular contact bearing, 
are preloaded by axial force by tightening the lock 
nut during the assembly.
It is essential to use the correct method of 
mounting and to observe cleanliness if the bearing 
is to function with satisfaction and achieve the 
required life. The precautions to be taken during the 
mounting operation are as follows: 
 
(i) Mounting should be carried out in a dust-
free and dry environment. Machines which 
produce metal particles, chips or sawdust 
should not be located in the vicinity of the 
mounting operation.
 
(ii) Before assembly, the shaft and the housing 
bore should be inspected. The burrs on the 
shaft and the shoulders should be removed. 
The accuracy of the form and dimensions 
of the shaft and bearing seat in the housing 
should be inspected.
 (iii) The bearing should not be taken out from 
its package until before it is assembled. The 
rust-inhibiting compound on the bearing 
should not be wiped except on the outer 
diameter and bore surface. These inner and 
outer surfaces are cleaned with white spirit 
and wiped with clean cloth.
 (iv) Small bearings are mounted on the shaft 
with the help of a small piece of tube or ring. 
Blows are applied by means of a hammer on 
this tube or ring. Direct blows should never 
be applied to the bearing surface, otherwise 
the race or the cage may get damaged. The 
tube or the metallic ring is placed against the 
inner race and the blows are applied with an 
ordinary hammer all around the periphery of 
the ring.
 
(v) Medium size bearings are mounted on the 
shaft by pressing the tube or the metallic 
ring by means of a hydraulic or mechanical 
press. Large size bearing is mounted by 
heating it to 80° to 90°C above the ambient 
temperature by induction heating and then 
shrinking it on the shaft. The bearing should 
never be heated by direct ﬂ ame.
The interference ﬁ t between the outer race and 
the housing is obtained by similar methods, viz., by 
applying hammer blows on a metallic ring or tube which 
is in contact with the outer race or by using hydraulic 
or mechanical press or by heating the housing.

16.1 BASIC MODES OF LUBRICATION
Lubrication is the science of reducing friction by 
application of a suitable substance called lubricant, 
between the rubbing surfaces of bodies having 
relative motion. The lubricants are classiﬁ ed into 
following three groups:
 
(i) Liquid lubricants like mineral or vegetable oils
 (ii) Semi-solid lubricants like grease
 (iii) Solid lubricants like graphite or molybdenum 
disulphide
The objectives of lubrication are as follows: 
 
(i) to reduce friction
 (ii) to reduce or prevent wear
 (iii) to carry away heat generated due to friction 
 (iv) to protect the journal and the bearing from 
corrosion 
The basic modes of lubrication are thick- and 
thin ﬁ lm lubrication. In addition, sometimes a term 
‘zero ﬁ lm’ bearing is used. Zero ﬁ lm bearing is a 
bearing which operates without any lubricant, i.e., 
without any ﬁ lm of lubricating oil. 
Thick ﬁ lm lubrication describes a condition 
of lubrication, where two surfaces of the bearing 
in relative motion are completely separated by 
a ﬁ lm of ﬂ uid. Since there is no contact between 
the surfaces, the properties of surface, like 
surface ﬁ nish, have little or no inﬂ uence on the 
performance of the bearing. The resistance to 
relative motion arises from the viscous resistance 
of the ﬂ uid. Therefore, the viscosity of the lubricant 
affects the performance of the bearing.
Thick ﬁ lm lubrication is further divided into two 
groups: hydrodynamic and hydrostatic lubrication. 
Hydrodynamic lubrication is deﬁ ned as a system of 
lubrication in which the load-supporting ﬂ uid ﬁ lm 
is created by the shape and relative motion of the 
sliding surfaces. The principle of hydrodynamic 
lubrication in journal bearings is shown in
Fig. 16.1. Initially, the shaft is at rest (a) and it

(b) Journal Starts to Rotate (c) Journal at Full 
Speed
602 Design of Machine Elements
sinks to the bottom of the clearance space under 
the action of load W. The surfaces of the journal 
and bearing touch during ‘rest’. As the journal 
starts to rotate, it climbs the bearing surface (b) 
and as the speed is further increased, it forces the 
ﬂ uid into the wedge-shaped region (c). Since more 
and more ﬂ uid is forced into the wedge-shaped 
clearance space, pressure is generated within 
the system. The pressure distribution around the 
periphery of the journal is shown in Fig. 16.2. 
Since the pressure is created within the system 
due to rotation of the shaft, this type of bearing 
is known as self-acting bearing. The pressure 
generated in the clearance space supports the 
external load (W). In this case, it is not necessary 
Fig. 16.2 
Pressure Distribution in Hydrodynamic 
Bearing
to supply the lubricant under pressure and the only 
requirement is sufﬁ cient and continuous supply 
of the lubricant. This mode of lubrication is seen 
in bearings mounted on engines and centrifugal 
pumps. Frequently, a term ‘journal’ bearing is 
used. A journal bearing is a sliding contact bearing 
working on hydrodynamic lubrication and which 
supports the load in radial direction. The portion 
of the shaft inside the bearing is called journal and 
hence the name ‘journal’ bearing.
There are two types of hydrodynamic journal 
bearings, namely, full journal bearing and partial 
bearing. The construction of full and partial 
bearings is illustrated in Fig. 16.3. In full journal 
bearing, the angle of contact of the bushing with 
the journal is 360°. Full journal bearing can take 
loads in any radial direction. Most of the bearings 
used in industrial applications are full journal 
bearings. In partial bearings, the angle of contact 
between the bush and the journal is always less 
than 180°. Most of the partial bearings in practice 
have 120° angle of contact. Partial bearing can take 
loads in only one radial direction. Partial bearings 
are used in railroad-cars. The advantages of partial 
bearings compared to full journal bearing are as 
follows:
 
(i) Partial bearing is simple in construction.
 (ii) It is easy to supply lubricating oil to the 
partial bearing.
 (iii) The frictional loss in partial bearing is less. 
Therefore, temperature rise is low.
Fig. 16.3 Full and Partial Bearings
There are two terms with reference to full 
and partial bearings, namely, ‘clearance’ bearing 
and ‘ﬁ tted’ bearing. A clearance bearing is a 
bearing in which the radius of the journal is less 
than the radius of the bearing. Therefore, there 
is a clearance space between the journal and the 
bearing. Most of the journal bearings are of this 
type. A ﬁ tted bearing is a bearing in which the 
radius of the journal and the bearing are equal. 
Obviously, ﬁ tted bearing must be partial bearing 
and the journal must run eccentric with respect to 
the bearing in order to provide space for lubricating 
oil.
There are two types of thrust bearings which 
take axial load, namely ‘footstep’ bearing and 
‘collar’ bearing as shown in Fig. 16.4. The footstep 
bearing or simply ‘step’ bearing is a thrust bearing 
in which the end of the shaft is in contact with the 
bearing surface. The collar bearing is a thrust 
Sliding-Contact Bearings 603
bearing in which a collar integral with the shaft 
is in contact with the bearing surface. In this case, 
the shaft continues through the bearing. The shaft 
can be with single collar or can be with multiple 
collars.
Fig. 16.4 Types of Thrust Bearing
Hydrostatic lubrication is deﬁ ned as a system of 
lubrication in which the load supporting ﬂ uid ﬁ lm, 
separating the two surfaces is created by an external 
source, like a pump, supplying sufﬁ cient ﬂ uid under 
pressure. Since the lubricant is supplied under 
pressure, this type of bearing is called externally 
pressurised bearing. The principle of hydrostatic 
lubrication in journal bearing is illustrated in
Fig. 16.5. Initially, the shaft rests on the bearing 
surface [Fig.16.5(a)]. As the pump starts, high pressure 
ﬂ uid is admitted in the clearance space, forcing the 
surfaces of the bearing and journal to separate out 
[Fig.16.5(b)]. Hydrostatic bearings are used on vertical 
turbo generators, centrifuges and ball mills.
Compared with hydrostatic bearings, hydro-
dynamic bearings are simple in construction, easy 
to maintain and lower in initial as well as mainte-
nance cost. Hydrostatic bearings, although costly, 
offer the following advantages:
 
(i) high load carrying capacity even at low 
speeds;
 (ii) no starting friction; and
 (iii) no rubbing action at any operating speed or 
load.

Hydrostatic Lubrication: (a) Journal at 
Rest (b) Journal at Full Speed
Thin ﬁ lm lubrication, which is also called 
boundary lubrication, is deﬁ ned as a condition of 
lubrication where the lubricant ﬁ lm is relatively 
thin and there is partial metal to metal contact. 
This mode of lubrication is seen in door hinges 
and machine tool slides. The conditions resulting 
in boundary lubrication are excessive load, 
insufﬁ cient surface area or oil supply, low speed 
and misalignment. The mechanism of boundary 
lubrication is shown in Fig. 16.6. There are 
certain fatty acids which contain polar molecules.
Fig. 16.6 
Boundary Lubrication: (a) Metal to Metal 
Contact (b) Cluster of Molecules
Molecules in which there is a permanent separation 
of positive and negative charges are called polar 
molecules. Their polarity has a tendency to orient 
604 Design of Machine Elements
and stick to the surface in a particular fashion. 
The clusters of polar molecules, cohering to 
one another and adhering to the surface, form a 
compact ﬁ lm which prevents metal to metal contact 
as is seen in the region B. This results in partial 
lubrication. There is also a zone (region A) where 
metal to metal contact takes place, junctions are 
formed at high spots and shearing takes place due 
to relative motion. The performance of bearing 
under boundary lubrication depends upon two 
factors, namely, the chemical composition of the 
lubricating oil, such as polar molecules (at the 
region B), and surface roughness (at region A). 
The hydrodynamic bearing also operates under the 
boundary lubrication when the speed is very low or 
when the load is excessive. 
There is a particular mode of lubrication known 
as elastohydrodynamic lubrication. When the 
ﬂ uid ﬁ lm pressure is high and the surfaces to be 
separated are not sufﬁ ciently rigid, there is elastic 
deformation of the contacting surfaces. This elastic 
deﬂ ection is useful in the formation of the ﬂ uid ﬁ lm 
in certain cases. Since the hydrodynamic ﬁ lm is 
developed due to elastic deﬂ ection of the parts, this 
mode of lubrication is called elastohydrodynamic 
lubrication. This type of lubrication occurs in gears, 
cams and rolling contact bearings.
16.2 VISCOSITY
Viscosity is deﬁ ned as the internal frictional 
resistance offered by a ﬂ uid to change its shape 
or relative motion of its parts. An oil ﬁ lm placed 
between two parallel plates is shown in Fig. 16.7. 
The lower plate is stationary while the upper plate 
is moved with a velocity U by means of a force P. 
Fig. 16.7 Newton’s Law of Viscosity
The molecules of oil are visualised as small balls, 
which roll in layers between two plates. The oil will 
stick to both the surfaces, and therefore the layer of 
molecules in contact with the stationary plate has 
zero velocity. Similarly, the layer of molecules 
in contact with the upper plate will move with a 
velocity U. The intermediate layers will move with 
velocities which are proportional to their distance 
from the stationary plate. Therefore,

This type of orderly movement is called streamline, 
laminar or viscous ﬂ ow. 
The tangential force per unit area, i.e.,  (P/A), 
is shear stress, while the ratio (U/h) is the rate of 
shear. According to Newton’s law of viscosity, the 
shear stress is proportional to the rate of shear at 
any point in the ﬂ uid. Therefore,

The popular unit of viscosity is the Poise, which 
gives absolute viscosity in dyne-s/cm2. Poise is a 
large unit and viscosities of most of the lubricating 
oils are given in terms of centi-Poise (cP), which is 
one-hundredth of a Poise. Therefore, following two 
separate notations are used for viscosity: 
m = viscosity in units of (N-s/mm2) or (MPa-s)
z = viscosity in units of (cP)

16.3 MEASUREMENT OF VISCOSITY
In practice, it is difﬁ cult to carry out an experiment 
with two parallel plates for the measurement of 
viscosity. The popular method of determining 
viscosity is to measure the time required for a given 
volume of oil to pass through a capillary tube of 
standard dimensions. The oil is kept in a reservoir, 
which is immersed in the constant temperature bath. 
Based on this principle, there are three commercial 
viscometers named after Saybolt, Redwood and 
Engler. The Saybolt universal viscometer is widely 
used in USA, the Redwood viscometer in UK and 
the Engler viscometer in the Indian subcontinent. 
In the Saybolt universal viscometer, 60 cm3 of 
lubricating oil is passed through a capillary tube 
of standard dimensions and the time is measured 
in seconds. The unit of viscosity is called Saybolt 
Universal Seconds (SUS), which is related to 
kinematic viscosity by the following relationship:
 
z
t
t
k =
-
È

˘
˚˙

(16.4)
where t is viscosity in Saybolt Universal Seconds 
(SUS) and zk is kinematic viscosity in centiStokes 
(cSt). The kinematic viscosity is deﬁ ned as the ratio 
of absolute viscosity to the density of lubricant. 
Therefore,
 
z
z
k = r 
(16.5)
where r is the density of the lubricant in g/cm3. A 
similar principle is used in Redwood viscometer, 
where 50 cm3 of lubricating oil is passed through 
a capillary tube of speciﬁ c dimensions and the time 
is measured in terms of Redwood seconds. In the 
Engler viscometer, the viscosity is measured in 
terms of Engler degrees (°E), which is the ratio of 
time taken by the oil to the time taken by water at 
the same temperature.
16.4 VISCOSITY INDEX
The viscous resistance of lubricating oil is due 
to intermolecular forces. As the temperature 
increases, the oil expands and the molecules 
move further apart, decreasing the intermolecular 
force in consequence. Therefore, the viscosity 
of the lubricating oil decreases with increasing 
temperature. The viscosity–temperature curves for 
some lubricating oils are shown in Fig. 16.8. The 
approximate relationship between viscosity and 
temperature is as follows:
 
log m =
+
A
B
T  
(16.6)
Fig. 16.8 Viscosity–Temperature Relationship
606 Design of Machine Elements
where A and B are constants and T is the absolute 
temperature.
The rate of change of viscosity with respect 
to temperature is indicated by a number called 
Viscosity Index (VI). The viscosity index is deﬁ ned 
as an arbitrary number used to characterize the 
variation of the kinematic viscosity of lubricating 
oil with temperature. In order to ﬁ nd out viscosity 
index of the oil, two groups of reference oils are 
considered. One group consists of oils having 
VI = 100 and these oils have very small change 
of viscosity with temperature. The other group 
consists of oils having VI = 0 and these oils have 
very large change of viscosity with temperature. 
The given oil is compared with these two reference 
oils, one with a viscosity index of 100 and the other 
of zero. Figure 16.9 shows the readings to be taken 
and values of reference oils required to ﬁ nd out 
the viscosity index. The procedure consists of the 
following steps:
 
(i) Measure the viscosities of the given sample 
of oil at 100° F and 212° F. Suppose the 
viscosities of the given sample of oil at
100° F and 212° F are y and x respectively. 
They are plotted in the ﬁ gure at points B 
and A respectively. The line BA shows the 
variation of viscosity for the given sample of 
oil.
Fig. 16.9 Viscosity Index
 (ii) Among the ﬁ rst reference group of oils 
with VI = 100, there will be one oil whose 
viscosity at 212° F will be x. Select this as 
the reference oil for comparison. Suppose 
the viscosity of this reference oil at 100°  F 
is H. The line DA shows the variation of 
viscosity for the reference oil with VI = 100.
 (iii) Among the second reference group of oils 
with VI = 0, there will be one oil whose 
viscosity at 212° F will be x. Select this as 
reference oil for comparison. Suppose the 
viscosity of this reference oil at 100° F is L. 
The line CA shows the variation of viscosity 
for the reference oil with VI = 0.
According to ASTM standards, the viscosity 
index is given by,
 
VI =
-

Ê
ËÁ

Therefore, the viscosity index indicates the 
rate of change of viscosity with temperature, as 
compared to oils with very small or very large rates 
of change of viscosity with temperature.
An oil with VI = 70 has less rate of change of 
viscosity with temperature compared with an oil 
with VI = 60.
16.5 PETROFF’S EQUATION
Petroff’s equation is used to determine the 
coefﬁ cient of friction in journal bearings. It is based 
on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The shaft is concentric with the bearing.
 (ii) The bearing is subjected to light load.
In practice, such conditions do not exist. 
However, Petroff’s equation is important because 
it deﬁ nes the group of dimensionless parameters 
that govern the frictional properties of the bearing. 
A vertical shaft rotating in the bearing is shown in 
Fig. 16.10(a). The following notations are used:
r = radius of the journal (mm)
l = length of the bearing (mm)
c = radial clearance (mm) 
ns = journal speed (rev/sec)
The velocity at the surface of the journal is 
given by,
 
U = (2pr) ns

16.6 MCKEE’S INVESTIGATION
In hydrodynamic bearings, initially the journal 
is at rest. There is no relative motion and no 
hydrodynamic ﬁ lm. Therefore, there is metal to 
metal contact between the surfaces of the journal 
and the bearing. As the journal starts to rotate, 
it takes some time for the hydrodynamic ﬁ lm to 
build sufﬁ cient pressure in the clearance space. 
During this period, there is partial metal to metal 
contact and a partial lubricant ﬁ lm. This is thin 
ﬁ lm lubrication. As the speed is increased, more 
and more lubricant is forced into the wedge-shaped 
clearance space and sufﬁ cient pressure is built 
up, separating the surfaces of the journal and the 
bearing. This is thick ﬁ lm lubrication. Therefore, 
there is a transition from thin ﬁ lm lubrication to 
thick ﬁ lm lubrication as the speed increases.
The transition from thin ﬁ lm lubrication to 
thick ﬁ lm hydrodynamic lubrication can be better 
visualized by means of a curve called mN/p curve. 
This curve is shown in Fig. 16.11. The mN/p curve
Fig. 16.11 mN/p Curve
is an experimental curve developed by McKee 
brothers. A bearing characteristic number is a 
dimensionless group of parameters given by,
608 Design of Machine Elements
Bearing characteristic number = mN
p
Ê
ËÁ
ˆ
¯˜
where,
m = absolute viscosity of the lubricant
N = speed of the journal
p = unit bearing pressure (load per unit of  
 
projected area of bearing) 
The bearing characteristic number is plotted on 
the abscissa. The coefﬁ cient of friction f is plotted 
on the ordinate. The coefﬁ cient of friction f is the 
ratio of tangential frictional force to the radial load 
acting on the bearing. As seen in Fig. 16.11, there 
are two distinct parts of the curve—BC and CD. 
 
(i) In the region BC, there is partial metal 
to metal contact and partial patches of 
lubricant. This is the condition of thin ﬁ lm 
or boundary lubrication.
 (ii) In the region CD, there is relatively thick 
ﬁ lm 
of 
lubricant 
and 
hydrodynamic 
lubrication takes place.
 (iii) AC is the dividing line between these two 
modes of lubrication. The region to the left 
of the line AC is the thin ﬁ lm zone while the 
region to the right of the line AC is the thick 
ﬁ lm zone.
 (iv) It is observed that the coefﬁ cient of friction 
is minimum at C or at the transition between 
these two modes. The value of the bearing 
characteristic number corresponding to this 
minimum coefﬁ cient is called the bearing 
modulus. It is denoted by K in the ﬁ gure.
The bearing should not be operated near the 
critical value K at the point C. A slight drop in the 
speed (N) or a slight increase in the load (p) will 
reduce the value of mN/p resulting in boundary 
lubrication. The guidelines for hydrodynamic 
lubrication are as follows: 
 
(i) In order to avoid seizure, the operating value 
of the bearing characteristic number (mN/p) 
should be at least 5 to 6 times that when the 
coefﬁ cient of friction is minimum. (5 K to
6 K or 5 to 6 times the bearing modulus).
 (ii) If the bearing is subjected to ﬂ uctuating 
loads or impact conditions, the operating 
value of the bearing characteristic number 
(mN/p) should be at least 15 times that when 
the coefﬁ cient of friction is minimum. (15 K 
or 15 times the bearing modulus).
It is observed from the (mN/p) curve that when 
viscosity of the lubricant is very low, the value 
of (mN/p) parameter will be low and boundary 
lubrication will result. Therefore, if the viscosity of 
the lubricant is very low then the lubricant will not 
separate the surfaces of the journal and the bearing 
and metal to metal contact will occur resulting in 
excessive wear at the contacting surfaces.
The (mN/p) curve is important because it deﬁ nes 
the stability of hydrodynamic journal bearings and 
helps to visualize the transition from boundary 
lubrication to thick ﬁ lm lubrication.

VISCOUS FLOW THROUGH 
RECTANGULAR SLOT
The ﬂ ow of lubricating oil through a rectangular 
slot is shown in Fig. 16.12(a). l is the length of 
the slot in the direction of ﬂ ow, while b and h are 
Fig. 16.12 Viscous ﬂ ow through slot: (a) Rectangular 
slot (b) Velocity distribution
dimensions of the slot in a plane perpendicular 
to the direction of ﬂ ow. The dimensions b is very 
large compared with h so that losses at the sides 
are neglected. The pressure difference between the 
Sliding-Contact Bearings 609
two sides of the central slice is (pa – pb) or Dp. The 
downward force due to this pressure difference is 
area (2xb) multiplied by the pressure difference 
(Dp) or (2xb Dp). On account of this force, the 
rectangular slice of width (2x) is extruded down. 
The shear resistance on both surfaces of the slice is 
due to the viscosity of the lubricant. According to

by considering the elemental ring of radius (r) and

The viscous resistance for this ring is (dF). It

Example 16.2 The pad of a square hydrostatic 
thrust bearing, with four pockets of 150 ¥ 150 mm, 
is shown in Fig. 16.15. The thrust load is 500 kN 
and the ﬁ lm thickness is 0.15 mm. The viscosity of 
the lubricant is 250 cP. The pressure in the area A 
bordering the pockets can be assumed to be uniform 
and equal to the supply pressure. The pressure 
distribution in the area B (shown by hatching 
lines) is assumed to be linear, varying from supply 
Fig. 16.15
pressure at the inner edge to atmospheric pressure 
at the outer edge. For calculating the ﬂ ow of the 
lubricant, it can be assumed that the area B is 
straightened out and has length equal to the mean 
length shown by the dotted line. Calculate
 
(i) supply pressure; and
 (ii) ﬂ ow requirement in litres/min.
Sliding-Contact Bearings 613
Solution
Given W = 500 kN ho = 0.15 mm z = 250 cP

The pressure in the area A is the supply pressure Pi 
while the average pressure in the area B is 1

Therefore,
W = (area A)(Pi) + (area B)(0.5 Pi)
or

\ 
Pi = 2.44 N/mm2 or MPa

(1000 cc = 1 litre)

(b)
Example 16.3 The dimensions of a hydrostatic 
thrust bearing, with a rectangular oil-groove A, 
are given in Fig. 16.16. The pressure distribution 
can be assumed to be linear, varying from supply 
Fig. 16.16
pressure at the inner edge of the groove to 
atmospheric pressure at the outer edge of the 
pad. The ﬂ ow over the corners can be neglected. 
The thrust load is 100 kN and the ﬁ lm thickness is 
0.02 mm. The viscosity of the lubricant is 300 cP. 
Calculate
 (a) supply pressure; and 
 (b) requirement of ﬂ ow.
Solution
Given W = 100 kN ho = 0.02 mm z = 300 cP
Step I Supply pressure
 
W = 
(area A)(Pi) + [(2 ¥ area B) + (2 ¥ area C)] (0.5 Pi)
or 
 
 
(100 ¥103) =

= 69.14 mm3/s 
(b)
Example 16.4 The hydrostatic thrust bearing 
of a generator consists of six pads as shown in 
Fig. 16.17(a). The total thrust load is 900 kN 
and the ﬁ lm thickness is 0.05 mm. The viscosity 
of the lubricant is 300 SUS. Neglecting the ﬂ ow 
over corners, each pad can be approximated as 
a circular area of 500 mm and 100 mm as outer 
and inner diameters respectively. This is shown in
Fig. 16.17(b). The density of the lubricating oil
is 0.9 g/cc. Calculate 
 
(i) the supply pressure; and
 (ii) the ﬂ ow requirement.

Example 16.7 Assume the data given in Example

For the optimum ﬁ lm thickness calculated in the

The mass of lubricating oil passing through the 
bearing is given by
m = rQ = 0.86(229.27 ¥ 103)(10–6) kg/s
 
= 0.197 kg/s
If Dt is the temperature rise then

Example 16.8 
A helical pinion is mounted 
on a vertical shaft and the shaft is supported on a 
hydrostatic foot step bearing. The trust component 
of the helical pinion is transmitted to the bearing 
through the shaft. The pinion transmits 75 kW 
power at 500 rpm. The normal module and the 
transverse module are 6 and 8 mm respectively. The 
pinion has 14 teeth. The nominal bearing pressure 
is 0.6 MPa. The ratio of recess diameter to shaft 
diameter is 0.70. Calculate
 
(i) the diameter of the shaft;
 (ii) the diameter of the recess; and 
 (iii) the supply pressure.
Select the viscosity of lubricating oil so that the 
minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness is 20 microns and the 
power lost in pumping and friction taken together 
is minimum.
Solution
Given kW = 75 n = 500 rpm 
For helical pinion, mn = 6 mm m = 8 mm z = 14
For bearing, Ri /Ro = 0.7 ho = 20 microns
pb = 0.6 MPa

16.10 REYNOLD’S EQUATION
The theory of hydrodynamic lubrication is based 
on a differential equation derived by Osborne 
Reynold. This equation is based on the following 
assumptions:
 
(i) The lubricant obeys Newton’s law of 
viscosity.
 (ii) The lubricant is incompressible.
 (iii) The inertia forces in the oil ﬁ lm are negligible.
 (iv) The viscosity of the lubricant is constant.
 (v) The effect of curvature of the ﬁ lm with 
respect to ﬁ lm thickness is neglected. It 
is assumed that the ﬁ lm is so thin that the 
pressure is constant across the ﬁ lm thickness.
 (vi) The shaft and the bearing are rigid.
 (vii) There is a continuous supply of lubricant.
An element having dimensions dx, dy and dz is 
considered in this analysis, and is shown in Figs 
16.20 and 16.21. X is the axis in the direction of 
motion, Y is the axis in the radial plane and Z is the 
axis parallel to the axis of the journal. u, v and w 
are velocities in X, Y, Z directions respectively. tx 
and tz are shear stresses along X and Z directions, 
while p is the ﬂ uid ﬁ lm pressure.

if the bearing is assumed to be either inﬁ nitely 
long or very short. These two solutions are called 
Sommerfeld’s solutions. Approximate solutions 
using numerical methods are available for bearings 
with ﬁ nite length.
16.11 RAIMONDI AND BOYD METHOD
There is no exact solution to Reynold’s equation for 
a journal bearing having a ﬁ nite length. However, 
AA Raimondi and John Boyd of Westinghouse 
Research Laboratory solved this equation on 
computer using the iteration technique. The results 
of this work are available in the form of charts 
and tables. In the Raimondi and Boyd method, the 
performance of the bearing is expressed in terms of 
dimensionless parameters. Table 16.1 gives values 
of these parameters2, 3 for a full journal bearing 
with side ﬂ ow.
In Fig. 16.25, O and O¢ are the axes of bearing 
and journal respectively. The distance OO¢ is called 
eccentricity and denoted by the letter e. The radial 
clearance c is given by,
 
c = R – r 
(16.15)
Fig. 16.25
where,
c = radial clearance (mm)
R = radius of bearing (mm)
r = radius of journal (mm)
The eccentricity ratio (e) is deﬁ ned as the ratio 
of eccentricity to radial clearance.
Therefore,
 
e = e
c
 
(16.16)
where, e is the eccentricity ratio.
Referring to Fig. 16.25,
 
R = e + r + ho 
(a)
where,
ho = minimum ﬁ lm thickness (mm)
Substituting Eq. (16.16) in expression (a),
 
c = R – r = e + ho = ce + ho

c (1 – e) = ho

16.13 BEARING DESIGN—SELECTION 
OF PARAMETERS
Very often, in the preliminary stages of journal 
bearing design, it is required to select suitable 
values for the following parameters:
 
(i) length-to-diameter ratio;
 (ii) unit bearing pressure;
 (iii) start-up load; 
 (iv) radial clearance;
 (v) minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness; and
 (vi) maximum oil ﬁ lm temperature.
(i) Length to Diameter Ratio In the design of 
hydrodynamic bearings, the diameter of the shaft 
is determined by strength or rigidity considerations 
and not on the basis of bearing capacity. The shaft 
diameter is usually determined by using the criteria 
such as permissible stress, permissible lateral 
deﬂ ection or permissible angle of twist. Therefore, 
it is the bearing length that the designer has to 
decide to obtain a given bearing capacity.
The length to diameter ratio (l/d) affects the 
performance of the bearing. As the ratio increases, 
the resulting ﬁ lm pressure increases as shown in 
Fig. 16.26. A long bearing, therefore, has more 
load carrying capacity compared with a short 
bearing. A short bearing, on the other hand, has 
greater side ﬂ ow, which improves heat dissipation.
Fig. 16.26 
Effect of (l/d) ratio on Average Bearing 
Pressure
The long bearings are more susceptible to metal 
to metal contact at the two edges, when the shaft 
is deﬂ ected under load. The longer the bearing, the 
more difﬁ cult it is to get sufﬁ cient oil ﬂ ow through 
the passage between the journal and the bearing. 
Therefore, the design trend is to use (l/d) ratio as 
1 or less than 1. When the shaft and the bearing 
are precisely aligned, the shaft deﬂ ection is within 
the limit and cooling of lubricant and bearing 
does not present a serious problem, the (l/d) ratio 
can be taken as more than 1. In practice, the (l/d) 
ratio varies from 0.5 to 2.0, but in the majority of 
applications, it is taken as 1 or less than 1. The 
following terminology is used in relation to (l/d) 
ratio,
 (a) When (l/d) ratio is more than 1, the bearing 
is called ‘long’ bearing.
 (b) When (l/d) ratio is less than 1, the bearing is 
called ‘short’ bearing.
 (c) When (l/d) ratio is equal to 1, the bearing is 
called ‘square’ bearing.
(ii) Unit Bearing Pressure The unit bearing 
pressure is the load per unit of projected area of 
the bearing in running condition. It depends upon 
a number of factors, such as bearing material, 
operating temperature, the nature and frequency 
of load and service conditions. The values of unit 
bearing pressure, based on past experience, are 
given in Table 16.2.

(iii) Start-up Load The unit bearing pressure for 
starting conditions should not exceed 2 N/mm2. 
The start-up load is the static load when the 
shaft is stationary. It mainly consists of the dead 
weight of the shaft and its attachments. The start-
up load can be used to determine the minimum 
length of the bearing on the basis of starting 
conditions.
(iv) Radial Clearance The radial clearance should 
be small to provide the necessary velocity gradient. 
However, this requires costly ﬁ nishing operations, 
rigid mountings of the bearing assembly and clean 
lubricating oil without any foreign particles. This 
increases the initial and maintenance costs. The 
practical value of radial clearance is 0.001 mm per 
mm of the journal radius. Or,
c = (0.001) r
The practical values of radial clearances for 
commonly used bearing materials are given in 
Table 16.3.

Aluminium–alloy
(0.002) r to (0.0025) r
(v) Minimum Oil Film Thickness The surface ﬁ nish 
of the journal and the bearing is governed by the 
value of the minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness selected by 
the designer and vice versa. There is a lower limit 
for the minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness, below which 
metal to metal contact occurs and the hydrodynamic 
ﬁ lm breaks. This lower limit is given by,
 
h0 = (0.0002)r 
(vi) 
Maximum 
Oil 
Film 
Temperature The 
lubricating oil tends to oxidise when the operating 
temperature exceeds 120°. Also, the surface of 
babbitt bearing tends to soften at 125°C (for 
bearing pressure of 7 N/mm2) and at 190°C (for 
bearing pressure of 1.4 N/mm2). Therefore, the 
operating temperature should be kept within these 
limits. In general, the limiting temperature is 90°C 
for bearings made of babbitts.
Bearings can be designed for two different 
conditions—bearings for maximum load carrying 
capacity and bearings for minimum frictional 
loss. The optimum values of

Example 16.10 
The following data is given 
for a full hydrodynamic bearing used for electric 
motor:
radial load = 1200 N
journal speed = 1440 rpm
journal diameter = 50 mm
static load on the bearing = 350 N
The values of surface roughness (cla) of the 
journal and the bearing are 2 and 1 micron 
respectively. The minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness should 
be ﬁ ve times the sum of surface roughness of the 
journal and the bearings. Determine
 
(i) length of the bearing;
 (ii) radial clearance;
 (iii) minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness;
 (iv) viscosity of lubricant; and
 (v) ﬂ ow of lubricant.
Select a suitable oil for this application 
assuming the operating temperature as 65°C.

Starting condition
The starting load on the bearing is the static load, 
i.e., 350 N. As discussed in Article 16.13, the start-

Referring to Fig. 16.8, it is observed that the 
values of viscosity for SAE-30 and SAE-40 oils 
are 30 and 38 cP respectively at the operating 
temperature of 65°C. We will select SAE-40 oil for 
this application, which will satisfy the minimum

Example 16.11 
Design a full hydrodynamic 
journal bearing with the following speciﬁ cation for 
machine tool application:
journal diameter = 75 mm
radial load = 10 kN
journal speed = 1440 rpm
minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness = 22.5 microns
inlet temperature = 40°C
bearing material = babbitt
Determine the length of the bearing and select a 
suitable oil for this application.
Solution
Given W = 10 kN n = 1440 rpm d = 75 mm
ho = 22.5 microns Ti = 40°C

From (a) and (b), it is observed that the 
lubricating oil should have minimum viscosity of 
19.58 cP at 50.72°C. Referring to Fig. 16.8, the 
viscosity of SAE-10 oil is 22 cP at 50°C. We will 
select SAE-10 oil for this application, which will 
satisfy the minimum viscosity of 19.58 cP.
Example 16.12 The following data is given for a 
360° hydrodynamic bearing:
length to diameter ratio = 1
journal speed = 1350 rpm
journal diameter = 100 mm
diametral clearance = 100 mm
external load = 9 kN
The value of minimum ﬁ lm thickness variable is 
0.3. Find the viscosity of oil that need be used.
Solution
Given W = 9 kN n = 1350 rpm d = 100 mm

Example 16.14 
The following data is given for 
a 360° hydrodynamic bearing:

journal diameter = 60 mm
bearing length = 60 mm
minimum oil ﬁ lm thickness = 0.009 mm
The class of ﬁ t is H7e7 (ﬁ ne) normal running ﬁ t. 
Specify the viscosity of the lubricating oil that you 
will recommend for this application.
Solution
Given W = 6.5 kN n = 1200 rpm d = 60 mm
l = 60 mm ho = 0.009 mm
Step I Sommerfeld number (Tables 3.2 and 3.3a)
The hole and shaft limits for H7e7 running ﬁ t are 
as follows:
Hole limits  (60 + 0.00) and (60 + 0.03) mm
Shaft limits (60 – 0.09) and (60 – 0.06) mm
If the manufacturing processes are centered, the 
average diameter of the bearing and journal will be 
60.015 and 59.925 mm respectively.

Example 16.15 
An oil ring bearing of a 
transmission shaft is shown in Fig. 16.28. There 
is no hydrodynamic action over the width of 4 
mm of the oil ring. The total radial load acting 
on the journal is 20 kN and the journal rotates at 
1450 rpm. The radial clearance and minimum 
ﬁ lm thickness are 20 to 5 microns respectively. 
Calculate
 
(i) viscosity of the lubricant; and
 (ii) required quantity of oil.

Solution
Given total load = 20 kN n = 1450 rpm
ho = 5 microns c = 20 microns
Step I Performance parameters 
The oil ring divides the bearing into two parts. 
Each part can be treated as separate hydrodynamic

The class of ﬁ t is H8d8 and the viscosity of the

Shaft limits (50 – 0.119) and (50 – 0.080) mm
When the process of manufacturing is centered,

Example 16.18 The following data is given for a 
360° hydrodynamic bearing:
radial load = 30 kN
journal diameter = 75 mm
bearing length = 75 mm
journal speed = 3600 rpm
radial clearance = 0.15 mm
inlet temperature = 40°C
The temperature–viscosity relationship is as 
follows:

Assume that the total heat produced in the 
bearing is carried by the total oil ﬂ ow. The speciﬁ c 
gravity and speciﬁ c heat of the lubricant are 0.86 
and 1.76 kJ/kg°C respectively.
Calculate the power lost in friction and the 
requirement of oil ﬂ ow.
Solution
Given W = 30 kN n = 3600 rpm d = 75 mm
l = 75 mm c = 0.15 mm Ti = 40° r = 0.86
cp = 1.76 kJ/kg°C
Step I Sommerfeld number–viscosity relationship
In practice, this type of problem occurs when the 
inlet temperature and lubricant are known. To 
determine the Sommerfeld number, the viscosity 
of the lubricant is to be speciﬁ ed. However, it 
varies with temperature and the average working 
temperature is unknown at this stage. Such 
problems are solved by the trial and error procedure.

16.14 BEARING CONSTRUCTIONS 
There are two types of bearing construction—
solid bushing and lined bushing, as shown in
Fig. 16.29. A solid bushing is made either by 
casting or by machining from a bar. It is then 
Fig. 16.29 Bearing Constructions
Sliding-Contact Bearings 635
ﬁ nished by grinding and reaming operations. A 
typical example of this type of bushing is bronze 
bearing. A lined bushing consists of steel backing 
with a thin lining of bearing material like babbitt. It 
is usually split into two halves.
There are two basic types of patterns of oil 
grooves—circumferential 
and 
cylindrical. 
A 
circumferential oil-groove bearing, as shown 
in Fig. 16.30(a), in effect divides the bearing 
into two short bearings, each of length (l/2). 
The pressure developed in the bearing along the 
axis is reduced due to the groove, as shown in
Fig. 16.30(b). This results in a lower load carrying 
capacity. The centrifugal force acting on the oil 
in the circumferential groove may build pressure 
higher than the supply pressure, which may 
restrict the ﬂ ow of the lubricant. Circumferential 
oil-groove bearings are used for the connecting 
rods and crankshafts of automotive engines.
Fig. 16.30 Circumferential Oil Groove Bearing
The cylindrical oil-groove bearing, as shown
in Fig. 16.31, has an axial groove almost along 
the full length of the bearing. It has a higher load 
carrying capacity compared with the circumferential 
oil-groove bearing; however, it is more susceptible 
to vibrations, known as oil-whip. Cylindrical
oil-groove bearings are used for gearboxes and 
high speed applications. In practice, different 
patterns of oil-groove are obtained by the 
combination of cylindrical and circumferential 
passages of the oil.
Fig. 16.31 Cylindrical Oil Groove Bearing
The principle of an oil-ring bearing is illustrated 
in Fig. 16.32. It consists of an oil ring in contact 
with the shaft and dipping in the oil bath below. The 
diameter of the oil ring is large compared with the 
diameter of the shaft. As the shaft rotates, the oil 
ring also rotates, although at a considerably lower 
speed and carries along with it the oil from the oil 
bath to the shaft. There are spreader grooves, which 
carry the oil to the entire surface of the shaft. The 
use of the oil ring bearing is restricted to horizontal 
shafts. 
Fig. 16.32 Principle of Oil ring Bearing
16.15 BEARING MATERIALS
The desirable properties of a good bearing material 
are as follows:
 
(i) When metal to metal contact occurs, the 
bearing material should not damage the 
surface of the journal. It should not stick or 
weld to the journal surface.
 (ii) It should have high compressive strength to 
withstand high pressures without distortion.
 (iii) In certain applications like connecting rods 
or crankshafts, bearings are subjected to 
ﬂ uctuating stresses. The bearing material, 
in these applications, should have sufﬁ cient 
endurance strength to avoid failure due to 
pitting.
636 Design of Machine Elements
 (iv) The bearing material should have the 
ability to yield and adopt its shape to that 
of the journal. This property is called 
conformability. When the load is applied, 
the journal is deﬂ ected resulting in contact at 
the edges. A conformable material adjusts its 
shape under these circumstances.
 (v) The dirt particles in lubricating oil tend to 
jam in the clearance space and, if hard, may 
cut scratches on the surfaces of the journal 
and bearing. The bearing material should be 
soft to allow these particles to get embedded 
in the lining and avoid further trouble. This 
property of the bearing material is called 
embeddability. 
 (vi) In applications like engine bearings, the 
excessive temperature causes oxidation of 
lubricating oils and forms corrosive acids. 
The bearing material should have sufﬁ cient 
corrosion resistance under these conditions.
 (vii) The bearing material should have reasonable 
cost and should be easily available in the 
market.
The most popular bearing material is babbitt. 
Due to its silvery appearance, babbitt is called 
‘white’ metal. There are two varieties of babbitts—
lead-base and tin-base, depending upon the major 
alloying element. They are used in the form of a 
strip or thin lining—about 0.5 mm thick—bonded to 
steel shells. Babbitts have excellent conformability 
and embeddability. Tin-base babbitts have better 
corrosion resistance and can be easily bonded to 
steel shells. High cost and shortage of tin are their 
main limitations. Babbitts, whether lead-base or 
tin-base, are inherently weak and their strength 
decreases rapidly with increasing temperature. 
Their use is further restricted due to poor fatigue 
strength. There are ten grades of white metals4 and 
their typical applications are as follows:
 
(i) Grade 90 and Grade 84 are used for 
bearings in petrol and diesel engines and in 
crossheads of steam engines.
 (ii) Grade 75 is used for repair jobs in mills and 
marine installations.
 (iii) Grade 69 is used in underwater applications 
and gland packing.
 (iv) Grade 60 is used in dynamos, electric 
motors, centrifugal pumps and other medium 
speed applications.
 (v) Grade 20 and Grade 10 are used in low 
speed applications, like concrete mixers and 
rope conveyors.
 (vi) Grade 6 is used in heavy duty applications 
like engine bearings, turbines and cross-
heads of steam engines.
 (vii) Grade 5 is used for line shafting and in 
railway carriages.
The chemical composition of these grades is 
given in Table 16.4.

The other bearing materials are bronze, copper–
lead, aluminium alloys and plastics. Compared 
with babbitts, bronze is cheaper, stronger and can 
withstand high pressures. It has got excellent casting 
and machining characteristics. Bronze bearing is 
made as a single solid unit. The main drawback of 
bronze bearing is its tendency to stick to the surface 
of the journal at high temperatures. Copper–lead 
bearings (70% Cu and 30% Pb) are used in the 
form of a thin lining like white metal. They have 
more hardness and fatigue strength and are used in 
heavy duty applications at high temperatures. Tin–
aluminium alloys have higher fatigue strength and 
they retain their strength even at high temperatures. 
They are used in engine bearings.

Sliding-Contact Bearings 637
There are certain non-metallic bearings like 
graphite, plastics (Teﬂ on) and rubber. For high 
temperature applications, conventional bearings 
with lubricating oils cannot be used. In such 
cases, bearings made of pure carbon (graphite) are 
employed. Teﬂ on has an extremely low coefﬁ cient 
of friction and requires no external lubricant like an 
oil. They are particularly useful where the bearing 
is located at an inaccessible position or where the 
lubricating oil is likely to cause contamination such 
as bearings for food processing machines. Rubber 
is used as bearing material in marine applications.
16.16 SINTERED METAL BEARINGS
Sintered metal powder bearings are made from 
compressed metal powder by the sintering 
process. They are porous bearings impregnated 
with lubricating oils. They can absorb lubricating 
oil to the extent of 20% to 30% of their volume. 
This oil serves as a reservoir enabling the bearing 
to run for a long period without any attention. 
They can be reﬁ lled with oil by soaked felts or 
wick-feed lubricators at periodic intervals without 
dismantling. There are two grades—copper-base 
and iron-base—of sintered bearings. A copper-base 
material has more corrosion resistance compared 
with an iron-base material. The permissible 
bearing pressures (load per unit of projected area) 
for copper-base and iron-base bearings are 60 
N/mm2 and 100 N/mm2 respectively. They give a 
satisfactory performance of up to 80°C. Sintered 
metal powder bearings are used in automobiles, 
textile machinery and machine tools. 
16.17 LUBRICATING OILS
The desirable properties of lubricating oil are as 
follows:
 
(i) It should be available in a wide range of 
viscosities.
 (ii) There should be little change in viscosity of 
the oil with change in temperature.
 (iii) The oil should be chemically stable with 
the bearing material and atmosphere at all 
temperatures encountered in the application.
 (iv) The oil should have sufﬁ cient speciﬁ c heat to 
carry away frictional heat, without abnormal 
rise in temperature.
 (v) It should be commercially available at 
reasonable cost.
Lubricating oils are divided into two groups—
mineral oils and vegetable or animal oils.
Mineral oils consist of hydrocarbons, which are 
obtained by the distillation of crude oil. There are 
two different classes of mineral oils—those with 
a parafﬁ nic series and those with a naphthenic 
series. A parafﬁ nic oil is composed of straight 
and branched chains of hydrocarbons deﬁ ned 
by the general formula CnH(2n + 2). A naphthenic 
oil is composed of a saturated single-ring 
formation of hydrocarbons deﬁ ned by the general 
formula CnH2n. Their structures are illustrated in
Fig. 16.33.
Fig. 16.33 Structure of Lubricating Oils
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) of 
USA has classiﬁ ed lubricating oils by a number, 
which is related to the viscosity of the oil in Saybolt 
638 Design of Machine Elements
Universal Seconds. This classiﬁ cation is based 
on only one property of lubricating oils, namely, 
viscosity. According to this system, automotive oils 
are classiﬁ ed in accordance with Table 16.5.

It can be observed from this table that the SAE 
number corresponds to approximately one-half of 
the viscosity of oil at 210°F measured in terms of 
SUS. When the SAE number is more, it indicates 
more viscous oil. The viscosities in the above table 
are measured at only one ﬁ xed temperature, i.e. 
210°F. It does not indicate the full picture of the 
viscosity–temperature relationship. It is, therefore, 
necessary to specify viscosities of these oils at a 
low temperature. This is achieved by specifying 
viscosities at 0°F as shown in the following table:

The letter W in the above table indicates winter 
grading of oils.
Compared with vegetable or animal oils, mineral 
oils offer the following advantages:
 
(i) Mineral oils are chemically inert.
 (ii) They have a wide range of viscosities, 
corresponding to different values of n in the 
general formula.
 (iii) They have little tendency to oxidise or form 
corrosive acids.
 (iv) After periodic ﬁ ltration, they can be 
reused without any loss or change of their 
properties.
 (v) At normal temperature, they are not liable to 
spontaneous ignition.
Vegetable oils used for lubrication are castor oil, 
rapeseed oil, palm oil and olive oil. Lubricating 
oils of animal origin are lard oil, tallow oil and 
certain oils obtained from marine species, such as 
whales, sperms or dolphin jaws. The advantages of 
vegetable and animal oils are as follows:
 
(i) These oils are sometimes referred to as ﬁ xed 
oils because they are non-volatile, unless 
there is chemical decomposition. This 
property prevents them from being expelled 
from intimate contacts of solid surfaces by 
frictional heat.
 (ii) They retain their viscosities at high 
temperature much better than mineral oils.
 (iii) These oils are called ‘polar’ compounds. 
They have a long chain of molecules with 
positive and negative charges at the two 
ends. One end of the polar molecule adheres 
to the surface of the journal or bearing and 
the long chain of molecules extends into 
clearance space. They form ‘clusters’ which 
prevents metal to metal contact in boundary 
lubrication.
The main drawbacks of vegetable or animal oils 
are as follows:
 
(i) At low temperature, these oils solidify and 
become ‘fats’. The fat is melted at about 
65°C and becomes oil.
 (ii) These oils react with oxygen in the 
atmosphere and become acidic. In some 
cases they change from the liquid state to an 
elastic solid form. Due to this reason, they 
are termed ‘drying oils’.
 (iii) They are subjected to saponiﬁ cation either 
by contact with base metals or with hot 
water. They produce glycerol and some 
organic acids, which attack metallic surfaces 
and form metallic soaps.
Castor oil was used in the past as a lubricant in 
racing cars and aero-engines. Rapeseed oil is added 
to mineral oil to increase viscosity. Cottonseed oil 
is mainly used as a thickener in mineral oils. Lard 
oil is used as cutting oil, while tallow oil is used 
as cylinder oil. In light machine tools, sperm oil is 
used for spindle lubrication.
Sliding-Contact Bearings 639
16.18 ADDITIVES FOR MINERAL OILS
An ‘additive’ is a substance added to mineral oil in 
order to improve a particular property of that oil. 
Mineral oil in which additives are mixed is called 
‘doped oil’ or ‘base oil’. The additives must be 
soluble in mineral oils. When the lubricating oil is 
likely to come in contact with water, the additive 
should not be soluble in water; otherwise it is likely 
to be washed out of the oil. Such a situation arises 
in case of steam engine or turbine lubricants. Most 
mineral oils depend upon additives. The additives 
are classiﬁ ed according to the property they are 
intended to improve, e.g., oxidation inhibitor, 
VI improver, pour-point depressant or anti-foam 
additive. Some additives perform more than one 
function and are called multi-functional additives, 
e.g., an oxidation inhibitor also reduces corrosion 
of bearing surfaces.
Oxidation inhibitors are widely used in 
automotive lubricants. It is observed that lubricating 
oils tend to oxidise on the walls of the piston 
and cylinder. This oxidation is accelerated as the 
temperature increases. The product of oxidation is a 
gummy substance. The piston ring may stick to the 
surface of the cylinder wall due to this substance. 
The mechanism of oxidation is not fully understood; 
however, it appears to be a chain reaction resulting 
in the formation of peroxides, which attack 
the bearing surfaces. Oil-soluble compounds 
containing sulphur and phosphorus are used as 
oxidation inhibitors. These additives act in two 
different ways. They compete with the base oil for 
oxygen and thus retard the formation of peroxides. 
They also decompose and break peroxides and 
prevent further corrosion of bearing surfaces.
The function of a ‘detergent’ additive is similar 
to that of soap. Hard abrasive piston deposits ﬁ nd 
their way into lubricating oil. These particles have 
a tendency to form aggregates. These aggregates 
wear out bearing surfaces and clog oil passages. 
Metallic soaps, such as calcium phenylstearate, are 
used as detergent additives. The detergent acts by 
coating the complete surface of the particle just like 
soap. The coating prevents the individual particles 
from combining, thus preventing formation of 
aggregate. Since the particles are small, they 
remain suspended in lubricating oil and do not 
cause wearing of bearing surfaces or clogging of 
oil passages.
A viscosity index improver is a substance 
which when added to mineral oils, increases 
viscosity at high temperatures. These additives 
are polymerized resins of high molecular weight, 
such as polyisobutylene, polymethacrylate ester 
and polyfumarite ester. The popular VI improver is 
‘paratone’ which is a polymer of butylene having 
the formula (C4H8)n where n varies from 180 to 270. 
Due to the large size of the molecule, the additive 
has extremely high viscosity. When added to the 
base oil, it increases viscosity at high temperature. 
At low temperature, the molecules are coiled and 
remain as colloidal suspension in the base oil. As 
the temperature increases, they uncoil, go into 
solution and increase its viscosity. This improves the 
viscosity index of the base oil. Normally, 1 to 2 per 
cent VI improver is added to the base oil.
Pour point is the lowest temperature at which 
the oil can ﬂ ow. This is an important characteristic 
when the lubricant is used in refrigeration and air-
conditioning equipment. Mineral oils of parafﬁ nic 
origin contain some amount of wax. When the 
temperature decreases below the pour point, the 
wax is separated in the form of needle shaped 
crystals. These crystals join with each other and 
form a matrix. The oil is held in the matrix in much 
the same fashion as water is retained in sponge. The 
mineral oil, therefore, ceases to function as a ﬂ uid. 
‘Paraﬂ ow’ is used as a pour point depressant. This 
type of additive surrounds the wax crystals in the 
form of a coating and prevents them from forming 
a large size matrix. The small-size crystals remain 
in suspension, but do not affect the ﬂ uidity of the 
base oil. 
Anti-foam additives are used in lubricants for 
aero-engines. In aircraft engines, a continuous 
formation of foam on the surface of the lubricating 
oil in the supply tank is often observed. Foaming 
is a serious problem at high altitudes. This is 
caused due to the excess capacity of the scavenge 
pump over that of the pressure pump. This causes 
the scavenge pump to introduce a large quantity 
640 Design of Machine Elements
of air into the lubricant. The excess capacity of 
the scavenge pump is necessary and cannot be 
avoided. When air is mixed in lubricating oil, foam 
is formed in the storage tank. When the storage 
tank is completely ﬁ lled, the foam overﬂ ows into 
the crankcase through the connecting pipeline. Due
to the compressibility of entrained air, the 
lubricating quality of the oil is impaired. Silicon 
polymer is used as an anti-foam additive. It acts as 
a chemical foam-breaker and reduces the stability 
of the foam.
Oiliness is considered as an important property 
under the conditions of boundary lubrication. 
Oiliness is distinct from viscosity, and refers 
to friction-reducing capacity. Oiliness is a joint 
property of the lubricant and the metallic surfaces 
in contact. It is a measure of lubricating qualities 
under boundary lubrication where the metal to metal 
contact is prevented by the ‘absorbed’ oil ﬁ lm. If 
there are two lubricants having same viscosities 
and if one results in lower friction under identical 
conditions then that lubricant is said to have better 
oiliness. There is no absolute measure of oiliness. 
It is observed that lard oil has better oiliness than 
mineral oils. Also, babbitts favour establishment 
of the ‘absorbed’ oil ﬁ lm improving oiliness. Oleic 
and stearic acids are used as oiliness additives. 
These additives have polar molecules. One end of 
the long chain of molecules has a strong afﬁ nity for 
the journal or bearing surface and sticks to it. These 
molecules orient in a particular fashion and form a 
cluster. The cluster of molecules prevents metal to 
metal contact. Vegetable or animal oils have more 
oiliness than mineral oils.
Extreme Pressure (EP) additives are used in 
applications, such as gears, where the lubricant 
is subjected to extremely high local pressures, at 
which oiliness additives are ineffective. These 
additives react with the surfaces of the journal 
and bearing and form a thin protective ﬁ lm under 
intense frictional heat at local spots. There are two 
types of EP additives—active and mild. Active 
additives include compounds of sulphur or chlorine. 
Sulphur reacts with steel surface and forms a tough 
ﬁ lm of iron sulphide. The melting point of this ﬁ lm 
is more than that of steel, which prevents local 
welding and formation of junctions. Mild additives 
include compounds of phosphorus and metallic 
soaps like lead naphthenate. EP additives are used 
for lubrication of all types of gears and cams.
16.19 SELECTION OF LUBRICANTS
Lubricating oils are commercially available under 
different trade names. Indian Oil Corporation5 
manufactures a wide range of lubricating oils and 
greases. These commercial lubricants contain 
a base oil and a group of additives, which are 
suitable for a given application. The properties of 
lubricating oils used for automotive applications 
are given in Table 16.6. There are ﬁ ve grades from 
SAE 10 to SAE 50. These base oils are blended 
with viscosity index improver, detergent additives 
and oxidation inhibitors. These oils are used for 
engine lubrication of petrol and diesel vehicles. 
They are also used for generators and pumping sets 
operating on diesel engines. There are two different 
classes of crankcase oil—Servo Engine Oil and 
Servo Super. The second is superior and costly. It is 
used for heavy duty internal combustion engines.

follows:
 
(i) It is self-mixing with petrol.
 (ii) It keeps the piston, piston rings, cylinder, 
plugs and exhaust port clean.
 (iii) It prevents corrosion of engine components.
 (iv) It controls deposits in the combustion 
chamber and reduces pre-ignition.

16.20 GREASES
Grease is a semisolid substance, composed of 
mineral oil and soap. Sometimes additives are 
added to this mixture to achieve speciﬁ c properties, 
such as chemical stability or oilness. The soap 
is present in the form of ﬁ bres, which form a 
matrix for the oil by the swelling mechanism. 
The type and amount of soap determines the 
texture and properties of the resulting grease. 
Grease is thixotropic, i.e., it undergoes a change 
in apparent viscosity with the amount of shearing. 
When the journal is stationary, the grease in the 
clearance space is quite rigid and immobile but 
when the journal starts rotating, the viscosity 
of the grease approaches to that of the base oil 
in the grease. Grease is normally recommended 
for inaccessible parts, where leakage of oil is 
objectionable. It is also used in applications 
where clearance is large due to rough machining. 
Greases are classiﬁ ed on the basis of the soap 
employed. Lime-base grease consists of calcium 
soap in mineral oils of grades SAE 10 to SAE 
40. It is insoluble in water. It is buttery and offers 
resistance to ﬂ ow. However, it has a tendency 
to channel and separate out from the machine 
component by centrifugal action. It is, therefore, not 
suitable for ball bearings. It is used for chassis parts 
including suspension, and for steering systems of 
vehicles. It is also used for open or semi-enclosed 
gears and chains. Soda-base grease is produced 
from sodium soap. It has more resistance to 
decomposition at high temperatures and pressures. 
Soda-base grease is water-soluble and possesses a 
sponge-like structure. It does not have a tendency 
to channel. It is mainly used for the lubrication of 
automotive wheel bearings. Lithium soap grease 
has excellent resistance to oxidation, and is used for 
water pumps, wheel bearings and chassis ﬁ ttings.
16.21 BEARING FAILURE—CAUSES AND 
REMEDIES
Fatigue failures are not common in journal bearings 
unlike ball bearings. The failures in journal 
bearings are mainly associated with insufﬁ cient 
lubricant, contamination of lubricant and faulty 
642 Design of Machine Elements
assembly. The principal types of bearing failure are 
as follows:
(i) Abrasive Wear Abrasive wear on the surface 
of the bearing is a common type of bearing 
failure. It is in the form of scratches in the 
direction of motion often with embedded particles. 
Abrasive wear occurs when the lubricating oil is 
contaminated with dust, foreign particles, rust or 
spatter. Proper enclosures for the bearing and the 
housing, cleanliness of lubricating oil and use of 
high viscosity oil are some of the remedies against 
this type of wear.
(ii) Wiping of Bearing Surface When the rotating 
journal touches the bearing, excessive rubbing 
occurs resulting in melting and smearing of the 
surface of the bearing. This type of failure is in 
the form of surface melting and ﬂ ow of bearing 
material. The main causes for this type of wear are 
inadequate clearance, excessive transient load and 
insufﬁ cient oil supply. The remedy is to keep these 
factors under control.
(iii) Corrosion The corrosion of bearing surface 
is caused by the chemical attack of reactive 
agents that are present in the lubricating oil. These 
oxidation products corrode materials such as lead, 
copper, cadmium and zinc. Lead reacts rapidly with 
all oxidation agents. The remedy is to use oxidation 
inhibitors as additive in the lubricating oil.
(iv) Distortion Misalignment and incorrect type 
of ﬁ t are the major sources of difﬁ culties in journal 
bearings. When the ﬁ t is too tight, bore distortion 
occurs. When foreign particles are trapped between 
the bearing and the housing during the assembly, 
local bore distortion occurs. Correct selection of the 
ﬁ t and proper assembly procedure are the remedies 
against this type of wear. 
16.22 COMPARISON OF ROLLING AND 
SLIDING CONTACT BEARINGS 
In this and the previous chapters, the characteristics 
of ball and roller bearings and hydrostatic and 
hydrodynamic bearings are discussed. The factors, 
which govern the selection between these two 
basic types of bearings, are load carrying capacity, 
frictional loss, space requirement, accuracy, noise 
and cost.
The load carrying capacity of a hydrodynamic 
bearing is linearly proportional to speed, as shown 
in Fig. 16.34. Any point below this curve, such as 
the point P1, indicates that the life corresponding 
to this load–speed combination is inﬁ nity. When 
the load exceeds, such as the point P2, the ﬂ uid 
ﬁ lm will break, resulting in metal to metal contact. 
In hydrostatic bearings, the load capacity is 
independent of speed. The rolling contact bearings 
have ﬁ nite life for a given combination of load 
and speed. Hydrodynamic bearings are suitable 
for high load–high speed conditions, particularly 
from considerations of a long life. Rolling contact 
bearings are vulnerable to shock loads due to 
poor damping capacity. The balls and raceways 
are subjected to plastic deformation under shock 
loads or ﬂ uctuating loads leading to noise, heat and 
fatigue failure. On the other hand, hydrodynamic 
bearings are better suited for these conditions, which 
occur in connecting rod or crankshaft applications.
Fig. 16.34 
Load Characteristics of Bearings:
(a) Hydrodynamic Bearing (b) Hydrostatic 
Bearing (c) Rolling Contact Bearing
Rolling-contact bearings require a lower starting 
torque compared to hydrodynamic bearings. In 
hydrodynamic bearings, metal to metal contact 
occurs at the beginning, which results in higher 
starting 
friction. 
However, 
under 
running 
conditions, when full hydrodynamic ﬁ lm has 
developed, the power losses due to friction are 
lower than that of rolling contact bearings. Ball 
Sliding-Contact Bearings 643
bearings are, therefore, suitable for applications 
where there are frequent starts. On the other hand, 
if there is comparatively light load at the start 
and if the load increases gradually with speed, 
hydrodynamic bearing is a better choice.
Rolling contact bearings require considerable 
radial space, while hydrodynamic bearings require 
more axial space. Hydrodynamic bearings require 
a lubricating system consisting of a pump, ﬁ lter, 
sump, pipelines, etc., which requires considerable 
additional space. From space considerations, 
rolling contact bearings are better. For the precise 
location of the journal axis, rolling contact bearings 
are preferred. In case of rolling contact bearings, 
the axes of the journal and the bearing are collinear. 
In hydrodynamic bearings, the journal moves 
eccentrically with respect to the bearing and the 
eccentricity varies with load and speed.
Rolling contact bearings, due to metal to metal 
contact, generate more noise compared with 
hydrodynamic bearings. The cost of hydrodynamic 
bearing is much more than that of rolling contact 
bearing due to additional accessories, like pump, 
ﬁ lter and pipelines. The maintenance cost of 
hydrodynamic bearing is also more. From cost 
considerations, rolling contact bearings are cheaper.

17.1 MECHANICAL DRIVES
Belt, chain and gear drives are often called 
‘mechanical’ drives. A mechanical drive is deﬁ ned 
as a mechanism, which is intended to transmit 
mechanical power over a certain distance, usually 
involving a change in speed and torque. In general, 
the mechanical drive is required between the prime 
mover, such as electric motor and the part of the 
operating machine. A mechanical drive is used on 
account of the following reasons: 
 
(i) The torque and speed of the machine are 
always different than that of electric motor 
or engine. Machines usually run at low speed 
and require high torque. For example, in 
case of overhead travelling crane, the motor 
runs at 1440 rpm while the speed of the rope 
drum is as low as 20 rpm. 
 
(ii) In certain machines, variable speeds are 
required for the operation, whereas the prime 
mover runs at constant speed. For example, 
in case of lathe, the motor runs at constant 
speed, while different speeds are required 
for the spindle of the chuck to turn the jobs 
of different materials and with different 
feeds and depth of cut.
 (iii) Standard electric motors are designed for 
uniform rotary motion. However, in some 
machines like shaper or planer, linear motions 
with varying velocities are required.
Mechanical drives are classiﬁ ed into two groups 
according to their principle of operation. The two 
broad groups are as follows:
 
(i) Mechanical drives that transmit power by 
means of friction, e.g., belt drive and rope 
drive
 
(ii) Mechanical drives that transmit power by 
means of engagement, e.g., chain drives and 
gear drives
The selection of a proper mechanical drive for a 
given application depends upon a number of factors 
such as centre distance, velocity ratio, shifting 
arrangement, maintenance considerations and cost. 
The guidelines for selection of suitable mechanical 
drive for the given application are as follows:
 
(i) Flat belts and roller chains are suitable 
for long centre distances. V-belts have 
comparatively short centre distances. Gear 
drives have the smallest centre distance 
between two shafts.
 
(ii) In ﬂ at belt drives, the belt slips over the 
pulley. Therefore, the driven pulley rotates 
at a speed which is less than that calculated 
by the ratio of diameters of the driving and 
driven pulleys. Due to slip, the velocity ratio 
is not constant. Therefore, ﬂ at belt drive is 
not recommended where constant speed is 
desirable. In case of chain drives, the velocity 
ratio is not constant during one revolution of 
the sprocket wheel due to ‘polygonal’ effect. 
Spur Gears 647
Gear drives are preferred in applications 
which require constant speed.
 (iii) In some applications, shifting mechanism is 
required to obtain different speeds such as 
headstock of lathe or automotive gearbox. 
Flat belts with relatively long centre 
distances can be shifted from tight to loose 
pulleys. Spur gears can be shifted on splined 
shaft. In case of V-belts or chain drives, it is 
not possible to use the shifting mechanism.
 (iv) Maintenance of belt drives is relatively 
simple. It usually consists of periodic 
adjustment of centre distance in order to 
compensate the stretch of the belt. In chain 
and gear drives, lubrication is an important 
consideration in maintenance.
 
(v) Flat belt drive is the cheapest, V-belt and 
chain drives are comparatively costly, and 
gear drives are costliest. 
17.2 GEAR DRIVES
Gears are deﬁ ned as toothed wheels or multilobed 
cams, which transmit power and motion from one 
shaft to another by means of successive engagement 
of teeth. Gear drives offer the following advantages 
compared with chain or belt drives:
 
(i) It is a positive drive and the velocity ratio 
remains constant.
 
(ii) The centre distance between the shafts is 
relatively small, which results in compact 
construction.
 (iii) It can transmit very large power, which is 
beyond the range of belt or chain drives.
 (iv) It can transmit motion at very low velocity, 
which is not possible with the belt drives.
 
(v) The efﬁ ciency of gear drives is very high, 
even up to 99 per cent in case of spur gears.
 (vi) A provision can be made in the gearbox for 
gear shifting, thus changing the velocity 
ratio over a wide range.
Gear drives are, however, costly and their 
maintenance cost is also higher. The manufacturing 
processes for gears are complicated and highly 
specialized. Gear drives require careful attention 
for lubrication and cleanliness. They also require 
precise alignment of the shafts.
17.3  CLASSIFICATION OF GEARS
Gears are broadly classiﬁ ed into four groups, viz., 
spur, helical, bevel and worm gears. A pair of spur 
gears is shown in Fig. 17.1. In case of spur gears, 
the teeth are cut parallel to the axis of the shaft. As 
the teeth are parallel to the axis of the shaft, spur 
gears are used only when the shafts are parallel. The 
proﬁ le of the gear tooth is in the shape of an involute 
curve and it remains identical along the entire width 
of the gear wheel. Spur gears impose radial loads on 
the shafts.
Fig. 17.1 Spur Gears
 A pair of helical gears is shown in Fig. 17.2. The 
teeth of these gears are cut at an angle with the axis 
of the shaft. Helical gears have an involute proﬁ le 
similar to that of spur gears. However, this involute 
proﬁ le is in a plane, which is perpendicular to the 
tooth element. The magnitude of the helix angle
Fig. 17.2 Helical Gears
648 Design of Machine Elements
of pinion and gear is same; however, the hand of the 
helix is opposite. A right-hand pinion meshes with a 
left-hand gear and vice versa. Helical gears impose 
radial and thrust loads on shafts. There is a special 
type of helical gear, consisting of two helical gears 
with the opposite hand of helix, as shown in Fig. 
17.3. It is called herringbone gear. The construction 
results in equal and opposite thrust reactions, 
balancing each other and imposing no thrust load 
on the shaft. Herringbone gears are used only for 
parallel shafts.
Fig. 17.3 Herringbone Gear
 Bevel gears, as shown in Fig. 17.4, have the 
shape of a truncated cone. The size of the gear tooth, 
including the thickness and height, decreases towards 
the apex of the cone. Bevel gears are normally used 
for shafts, which are at right angles to each other. 
This, however, is not a rigid condition and the angle 
can be slightly more or less than 90 degrees. The 
tooth of the bevel gears can be cut straight or spiral.
Fig. 17.4 Bevel Gears
Bevel gears impose radial and thrust loads on the 
shafts.
 The worm gears, as shown in Fig. 17.5, consist 
of a worm and a worm wheel. The worm is in the 
form of a threaded screw, which meshes with the 
matching wheel. The threads on the worm can be 
single or multi-start and usually have a small lead. 
Worm gear drives are used for shafts, the axes of 
which do not intersect and are perpendicular to each 
other. The worm imposes high thrust load, while the 
worm wheel imposes high radial load on the shafts. 
Worm gear drives are characterized by high speed 
reduction ratio.
Fig. 17.5 Warm Gears
17.4 SELECTION OF TYPE OF GEARS
The ﬁ rst step in the design of the gear drive is 
the selection of a proper type of gear for a given 
application. The factors that are considered for 
deciding the type of gear are general layout of 
shafts, speed reduction, power to be transmitted, 
input speed and cost. Spur and helical gears are 
used when the shafts are parallel. When the shafts 
intersect at right angles, bevel gears are used. Worm 
gears are recommended when the axes of shafts 
are perpendicular and non-intersecting. When the 
axes of two shafts are neither perpendicular not 
intersecting, crossed helical gears are employed.
 The speed reduction or velocity ratio for a single 
pair of spur or helical gears is normally taken as
6 : 1. On rare occasions, this can be raised to 10 : 1. 
When the velocity ratio increases, the size of the 
gear wheel increases. This results in increase in the 
size of the gearbox and the material cost increases. 
Spur Gears 649
For high speed reduction, two-stage or three-stage 
constructions are used. The normal velocity ratio for 
a pair of bevel gears is 1 : 1, which can be increased 
to 3: 1 under certain circumstances. For high speed 
reduction, worm gears offer the best choice. The 
velocity ratio in their case is 60 : 1, which can be 
increased to 100 : 1. They are widely used in material 
handling equipment due to this advantage.
 Spur gears generate noise in high speed 
applications, due to sudden contact over the entire 
face width between two meshing teeth. In helical 
gears, the contact between the two meshing teeth 
begins with a point and gradually extends along 
the tooth, resulting in quiet operations. Helical 
gears are, therefore, preferred for high speed power 
transmission. From cost considerations, spur gears are 
the cheapest. They are not only easy to manufacture 
but there exist a number of methods to manufacture 
them. The manufacturing of helical, bevel and 
worm gears is a specialized and costly operation.
17.5  LAW OF GEARING
The fundamental law of gearing states ‘The common 
normal to the tooth proﬁ le at the point of contact 
should always pass through a ﬁ xed point, called 
the pitch point, in order to obtain a constant 
velocity ratio’. Referring to Fig. 17.6, O1 and O2 
Fig. 17.6 Law of Gearing
are centres of the two gears rotating with angular 
velocities w1 and w2 respectively. C is the point of 
contact between the teeth of the two gears and NN is 
the common normal at the point of contact.
 is the velocity of the point C, when it is 
considered on the gear 1, while 
 is the velocity 
of the point C, when it is considered on the gear 2. 
Also,
CA ^  O1C  and  CB ^   O2C
The projections of the two vectors 
 and 
, i.e., 
, along the common normal NN must be equal, 
otherwise the teeth will not remain in contact and 
there will be a slip.

It has been found that only involute and cycloidal 
curves satisfy the fundamental law of gearing. The 
meaning of these curves is as follows:
 
(i) An involute is a curve traced by a point on 
a line as the line rolls without slipping on a 
circle.
 
(ii) A cycloid is a curve traced by a point on the 
circumference of a generating circle as it 
rolls without slipping along the inside and 
outside of another circle. The cycloid proﬁ le 
consists of two curves, namely, epicycloid 
and hypocycloid. An epicycloid is a curve 
traced by a point on the circumference 
of a generating circle as it rolls without 
slipping on the outside of the pitch circle. A 
hypocycloid is a curve traced by a point on 
the circumference of a generating circle as 
it rolls without slipping on the inside of the 
pitch circle.
Cycloidal tooth offers the following advantages 
compared with involute tooth:
 
(i) In case of cycloidal gears, a convex ﬂ ank on 
one tooth comes in contact with the concave 
ﬂ ank of the mating tooth. This increases the 
contact area and also the wear strength. In 
involute gears, the contact is between two 
convex surfaces on mating teeth, resulting 
in smaller contact area and lower wear 
strength.
 
(ii) The phenomenon of interference does not 
occur at all in cycloidal gears.
However, cycloidal teeth are rarely used in 
practice due to the following disadvantages:
 
(i) Cycloidal tooth is made of two curves—
hypocycloid curve below the pitch circle 
and epicycloid curve above the pitch 
circle. It is very difﬁ cult to manufacture an 
accurate proﬁ le consisting of two curves. 
The proﬁ le of an involute tooth is made 
of a single curve and only one cutter is 
necessary to manufacture one complete set 
of pinion and gear. This results in reduction 
in manufacturing cost.
 
(ii) In case of an involute proﬁ le, the common 
normal at the point of contact always passes 
through the pitch point P and maintains a 
constant inclination a with the common 
tangent to the two pitch circles. The angle 
a is called the pressure angle. Therefore, 
the pressure angle remains constant in 
involute tooth. In case of cycloidal tooth, 
the pressure angle varies. The pressure 
angle has maximum value at the beginning 
of engagement and reduces to zero when 
the point of contact coincides with the pitch 
point. It again increases to maximum value 
in the reverse direction. 
 It is due to these reasons that cycloidal curves 
have become obsolete. However, they are still in 
use in some of applications, such as spring driven 
watches and clocks, and some instruments. In these 
applications, their ability to provide satisfactory 
operation with very small number of teeth is used 
to advantage.
17.6 TERMINOLOGY OF SPUR GEARS
The terminology of gears includes a number of 
terms peculiar to gears and it forms the basis of gear 
language. The terminology applied to spur gears is 
illustrated in Figs 17.7 to 17.9. The notations used 
Fig. 17.7 Gear Nomenclature
in this chapter are recommended by the Bureau of 
Indian Standards1, 2. Gear terminology consists of 
following terms:
 1 IS 2458–1965: Glossary of terms for toothed gearing.
 2 IS 2467–1963: Notations for toothed gearing.
Spur Gears 651
(i) Pinion A pinion is the smaller of the two mating 
gears.
(ii) Gear A gear is the larger of the two mating 
gears.
 
Fig. 17.8 Gear Nomenclature
Fig. 17.9 Terminology of Gear
(iii) Velocity Ratio (i) Velocity ratio is the ratio of 
angular velocity of the driving gear to the angular 
velocity of the driven gear. It is also called the speed 
ratio.
(iv) Transmission Ratio (i’) The transmission 
ratio (i’) is the ratio of the angular speed of the ﬁ rst 
driving gear to the angular speed of the last driven 
gear in a gear train.
(v) Pitch Surface The pitch surfaces of the gears 
are imaginary planes, cylinders or cones that roll 
together without slipping.
(vi) Pitch Circle The pitch circle is the curve of 
intersection of the pitch surface of revolution and the 
plane of rotation. It is an imaginary circle that rolls 
without slipping with the pitch circle of a mating 
gear. The pitch circles of a pair of mating gears are 
tangent to each other.
(vii) Pitch Circle Diameter The pitch circle 
diameter is the diameter of the pitch circle. The size 
of the gear is usually speciﬁ ed by the pitch circle 
diameter. It is also called pitch diameter. The pitch 
circle diameter is denoted by d ¢.
(viii) Pitch Point The pitch point is a point on 
the line of centres of two gears at which two pitch 
circles of mating gears are tangent to each other.
(ix) Top Pand The top land is the surface of the top 
of the gear tooth.
(x) Bottom Pand The bottom land is the surface of 
the gear between the ﬂ anks of adjacent teeth.
(xi) Involute An involute is a curve traced by a 
point on a line as the line rolls without slipping on 
a circle.
(xii) Base Circle The base circle is an imaginary 
circle from which the involute curve of the tooth 
proﬁ le is generated. The base circles of two mating 
gears are tangent to the pressure line.
(xiii) Addendum Circle The addendum circle is an 
imaginary circle that borders the tops of gear teeth 
in the cross section. 
(xiv) Addendum (ha) The addendum (ha) is the 
radial distance between the pitch and the addendum 
circles. Addendum indicates the height of the tooth 
above the pitch circle.
(xv) Dedendum Circle The dedendum circle is an 
imaginary circle that borders the bottom of spaces 
between teeth in the cross section. It is also called 
root circle.
(xvi) Dedendum (hf) The dedendum (hf) is the 
radial distance between pitch and the dedendum 
circles. The dedendum indicates the depth of the 
tooth below the pitch circle.
(xvii) Clearance (c) The clearance is the amount 
by which the dedendum of a given gear exceeds the 
addendum of its mating tooth.
(xviii) Face of Tooth The surface of the gear 
tooth between the pitch cylinder and the addendum 
cylinder is called the face of tooth.
(xix) Flank of Tooth The surface of the gear tooth 
between the pitch cylinder and the root cylinder is 
called ﬂ ank of the tooth.
652 Design of Machine Elements
(xx) Face Width (b) Face width is the width of the 
tooth measured parallel to the axis. 
(xxi) Fillet Radius The radius that connects the 
root circle to the proﬁ le of the tooth is called ﬁ llet 
radius.
(xxii) Circular Tooth Thickness The length of the 
arc on the pitch circle subtending a single gear tooth 
is called circular tooth thickness. Theoretically, 
circular tooth thickness is half of the circular pitch.
(xxiii) Tooth Space The width of the space between 
two adjacent teeth measured along the pitch circle is 
called the tooth space. Theoretically, tooth space is 
equal to circular tooth thickness or half the circular 
pitch.
(xxiv) Working Depth (hk) The working depth is 
the depth of engagement of two gear teeth, that is, 
the sum of their addendums.
(xxv) Whole Depth (h) The whole depth is the 
total depth of the tooth space, that is, the sum of 
the addendum and dedendum. Whole depth is also 
equal to working depth plus clearance.
(xxvi) Centre Distance The centre distance is the 
distance between centres of pitch circles of mating 
gears. It is also the distance between centres of base 
circles of mating gears.
(xxvii) Pressure Angle The pressure angle is the 
angle which the line of action makes with the common 
tangent to the pitch circles. The pressure angle is also 
called the angle of obliquity. It is denoted by a. 
(xxviii) Line of Action The line of action is the 
common tangent to the base circles of mating gears. 
The contact between the involute surfaces of mating 
teeth must be on this line to give a smooth operation. 
The force is transmitted from the driving gear to the 
driven gear on this line.
(xxix) Arc of Contact The arc of contact is the arc 
of the pitch circle through which a tooth moves from 
the beginning to the end of contact with mating 
tooth.
(xxx) Arc of Approach The arc of approach is the 
arc of the pitch circle through which a tooth moves 
from its beginning of contact until the point of 
contact arrives at the pitch point.
(xxxi) Arc of Recess The arc of recess is the arc of 
the pitch circle through which a tooth moves from 
the contact at the pitch point until the contact ends.
(xxxii) Contact Ratio (mp) The number of pairs 
of teeth that are simultaneously engaged is called 
contact ratio. If there are two pairs of teeth in contact 
all the time, the contact ratio is 2. As the two gears 
rotate, smooth and continuous transfer of power from 
one pair of meshing teeth to the following pair is 
achieved when the contact of the ﬁ rst pair continues 
until the following pair has established contact. 
Some overlapping is essential for this purpose. 
Therefore, the contact ratio is always more than 1. 
Other things being, the greater the contact ratio, the 
smoother the action of gears. The contact ratio for 
smooth transfer of motion is usually taken as 1.2. 
In industrial gearboxes for power transmission, the 
contact ratio is usually more than 1.4 (1.6 to 1.7). 
(xxxiii) Circular Pitch The circular pitch (p) is the 
distance measured along the pitch circle between 
two similar points on adjacent teeth. Therefore, 
 
p
d
z
=
¢
p
 
 (17.1)

the ratio of the number of teeth to the pitch circle 
diameter. Therefore,

There are a number of methods to manufacture 
gears. They include casting, blanking and machining. 
However, power transmitting gears are made of steel 
and made by the following methods:
 
(i) Milling
 
(ii) Rack generation
 (iii) Hobbing
 (iv) Fellow gear shaper method
The hobbing process accounts for the manufacture 
of a major quantity of gears that are used for power 
transmission.
17.7 STANDARD SYSTEMS OF GEAR 
TOOTH
All standard systems prescribe the involute proﬁ le 
for gear tooth. The reasons are as follows: 
 
(i) The involute proﬁ le satisﬁ es the fundamental 
law of gearing at any centre distance.
 
(ii) All involute gears of a given module 
and 
pressure 
angle 
are 
completely 
interchangeable.
 (iii) All involute gears of a given module and 
pressure angle can be machined from one 
single tool. 
 (iv) The basic rack of an involute proﬁ le has 
straight sides. It is comparatively easy to 
machine straight sides. Further, straight sides 
can be more accurately machined compared 
with a curved surface.
 
(v) A slight change in the centre distance, which 
might be caused by incorrect mounting, has 
no effect upon the shape of the involute. In 
addition, the pitch point is still ﬁ xed and the 
law of gearing is satisﬁ ed. Therefore, the 
velocity ratio remains constant.
 There are three standard systems for the shape of 
gear teeth. They are as follows:
 
(i) 14.5° full depth involute system
 
(ii) 20° full depth involute systems
 (iii) 20° stub involute system
As the number of teeth on the gear is increased, the 
involute outline becomes straighter and straighter. 
When the number of teeth is inﬁ nity or when the pitch 
circle radius approaches inﬁ nity, the gear becomes a 
rack with straight-sided teeth. This rack is called the 
‘basic’ rack, which is standardized in each system of 
gearing. The basic racks for three standard systems 
are shown in Fig. 17.10. The shapes of tooth proﬁ le 
for these systems are illustrated in Fig. 17.11. The 
standard proportions for these systems are given in 
Table 17.1.

(i) 14.5° Full Depth Involute system The basic rack 
for this system is composed of straight sides except 
for the ﬁ llet arcs. In this system, interference occurs 
when the number of teeth on the pinion is less than 
23. This system is satisfactory when the number of 
teeth on the gears is large. If the number of teeth 
is small and if the gears are made by generating 
process, undercutting is unavoidable. 
(ii) 20° Full Depth Involute System The basic rack 
for this system is also composed of straight sides 
except for the ﬁ llet arcs. In this system, interference 
occurs when the number of teeth on the pinion is 
less than 17. The 20° pressure angle system with 
full depth involute teeth is widely used in practice. 
It is also recommended by the Bureau of Indian 
Standards and adopted in this chapter.
Increasing pressure angle improves the tooth 
strength but shortens the duration of contact. 
Decreasing pressure angle requires more number of 
teeth on the pinion to avoid undercutting. The 20° 
pressure angle is a good compromise for most of the 
power transmission as well as precision gearboxes.
 The 20° pressure angle system has the following 
advantages over the 14.5° pressure angle system:
 
(a) It reduces the risk of undercutting.
 
(b) It reduces interference.
 
(c) Due to the increased pressure angle, the 
tooth becomes slightly broader at the root. 
This makes the tooth stronger and increases 
the load carrying capacity.
 
(d) It has greater length of contact.
The main advantage of the 14.5° pressure angle 
system is its quietness of operation.
(iii) 20° Stub Involute System The gears in 
this system have shorter addendum and shorter 
dedendum. The interfering portion of the tooth, 
that is, a part of the addendum, is thus removed. 
Therefore, these teeth have still smaller interference. 
This also, reduces the undercutting. In this system, 
the minimum number of teeth on the pinion, to avoid 
interference, is 14. Since the pinion is small, the 
drive becomes more compact. Stub teeth are stronger 
than full depth teeth because of the smaller moment 
arm of the bending force. Therefore, the stub system 
transmits very high load. Stub teeth results in lower 
production cost, as less metal must be cut away. The 
main drawback of this system is that the contact 
ratio is reduced due to short addendum. Due to 
insufﬁ cient overlap, vibrations are likely to occur.
The module speciﬁ es the size of the gear tooth. 
Figure 17.12 shows the actual sizes of gear teeth 
with four different modules. It is observed that as 
the module increases, the size of gear tooth also 
increases. It can be said that module is the ‘index’ 
of the size of gear tooth. The standard values of 
module3 are given in Table 17.2. The module given 
Fig. 17.12 Size of Gear Tooth for Various Modules

under Choice-1 is always preferred. If that is not 
possible under certain circumstances, the module 
under Choice-2 can be selected.

The standard proportions of the gear tooth in 
terms of module m, for 20° full depth system are 
rewritten here.
addendum (ha) = (m)
dedendum (hf ) = (1.25 m)
clearance (c) = (0.25 m)
working depth (hk) = (2 m)
whole depth (h) = (2.25 m)
tooth thickness (s) = (1.5708 m)
tooth space = (1.5708 m)
ﬁ llet radius = (0.4 m)
One of the methods of strengthening the gear 
tooth is ‘crowning’. During operation, there is 
uneven distribution of pressure along the face width 
of the tooth due to the following reasons:
 
(i) Inaccuracies of tooth proﬁ le caused by 
machining errors and distortion during heat 
treatment
 
(ii) Errors in assembly
 (iii) Elastic deﬂ ection of shaft due to gear tooth 
forces and bearing reactions
This results in shifting the maximum pressure to 
the end of the tooth along the face width. This load 
can be shifted towards the middle of the face width 
by crowning the tooth as illustrated in Fig. 17.13.
Fig. 17.13 Crowning of Gear Tooth
In the crowning process, the ends of the tooth are 
made slightly thinner by an amount c. The crowning 
is done by shaving cutters. The crown c is very small 
and depends upon the elastic deﬂ ection of teeth in 
operation. In practice, the crown c is usually taken 
as (0.0003 b) to (0.0005 b).
In the design of gears, the number of teeth is decided 
from the speed ratio. The module is calculated from 
strength and wear equations. Knowing these two 
parameters, the other dimensions can be calculated 
by the above proportions. The conventional 
representation of a pair of spur gears is illustrated in 
Fig. 17.14. The pitch circles of the pinion and gear 
are important in drawing, because pitch surfaces 
roll together without slip during engagement. The 
pitch circles are shown by centrelines. In addition to 
pitch circles, the addendum circles are drawn with 
full lines.

17.8 GEAR TRAINS
A gear train consists of two or more gears 
transmitting power from the driving shaft to the 
driven shaft. The gear trains are classiﬁ ed into the 
following categories: 
 
(i) Simple gear train
 
(ii) Compound gear train
 (iii) Reverted gear train
 (iv) Epicyclic gear train
Simple gear trains are illustrated in Fig. 17.15. A 
simple gear train is one in which each shaft carries 
only one gear. In this type of train, the velocity ratio 
is equal to the number of teeth on the last driven 
gear to the number of teeth on the ﬁ rst driving gear. 
For example, the velocity ratio for the gear train 
illustrated in Fig. 17.15(c), is given by,
 
 
n

The gears other than driving and driven gears are 
called idler gears. The functions of idler gear are as 
follows:
 
(i) Idler gears ﬁ ll the space between the driving 
and driven gears.
 
(ii) Idler gears change the direction of rotation 
of the last driven shaft relative to the ﬁ rst 
driving shaft. 
Fig. 17.15 Simple Gear Trains
The rules regarding direction of rotation are as 
follows: 
 
(i) If an odd number of idler gears is used, 
the ﬁ rst and last shafts rotate in the same 
direction.
 
(ii) If even (or zero) number of idler gears is 
used, the ﬁ rst and last shafts rotate in the 
opposite direction.
The main drawback of simple gear train is its 
large overall dimensions and weight. A compound 
gear train is one in which at least one shaft carries 
two gears. A compound gear train is illustrated in 
Fig. 17.16. In this ﬁ gure, the intermediate shaft 
has two gears, one meshing with the gear on the 
driving shaft and the other meshing with the gear 
on the driven shaft. The angular velocity of two 
gears mounted on the intermediate shaft is the same. 
The velocity reduction is done in two stages. The 
velocity ratio is given by,

Spur Gears 657
When the number of teeth on various gears in 
compound gear train are selected in such a way that 
the centre distance between gears 1 and 2 is equal 
to the centre distance between gears 3 and 4 then 
the driving and driven shafts can be located on 
the same centre line. This type of arrangement is 
called ‘reverted’ gear train, which is illustrated in
Fig. 17.17. In this case,
 
m1 (z1 + z2) = m2 (z3 + z4)
where,
 
m1 = module for gears 1 and 2
 
m2 = module for gears 3 and 4
Fig. 17.16 Compound Gear Train
Fig. 17.17 Reverted Gear Train
Reverted gear train is very useful in clocks 
and instruments where it is desirable to have two 
pointers on concentric shafts moving with speciﬁ c 
velocity ratio. Reverted gear train is the most 
compact gearbox.
An epicyclic gear train is illustrated in Fig. 17.18. 
It is a gear train in which one gear is ﬁ xed and the 
meshing gear has a motion composed of two parts, 
namely, a rotation about its own axis and a rotation 
about the axis of the ﬁ xed gear. This type of train is 
also called a ‘planetary’ gear train. The ﬁ xed gear 
is called the sun gear, while the revolving gear is 
called the planet gear. In the arrangement shown in 
the ﬁ gure, the sun gear is the driving gear and the 
crank is connected to the driven shaft. The crank is 
also called the planet carrier. In some arrangements, 
there are three planet gears and a ﬁ xed ring gear. The 
epicyclic gear train has compact construction.

17.9 INTERFERENCE AND   
 
 UNDERCUTTING
A gear tooth has involute proﬁ le only outside the
base circle. In fact, the involute proﬁ le begins at 
the base circle. In some cases, the dedendum is 
so large that it extends below this base circle. In 
such situations, the portion of the tooth below the 
base circle is not involute. The tip of the tooth on 
the mating gear, which is involute, interferes with 
this non-involute portion of the dedendum. This 
phenomenon of tooth proﬁ les overlapping and 
cutting into each other is called ‘interference’. In 
this case, the tip of the tooth overlaps and digs into 
the root section of its mating gear. Interference is 
non-conjugate action and results in excessive wear, 
vibrations and jamming.
658 Design of Machine Elements
When the gears are generated by involute rack 
cutters, this interference is automatically eliminated 
because the cutting tool removes the interfering 
portion of the ﬂ ank. This is called ‘undercutting’. 
Undercutting solves the problem of interference. 
However, an undercut tooth is considerably weaker. 
Undercutting not only weakens the tooth, but also 
removes a small involute portion adjacent to the 
base circle. This loss of involute proﬁ le may cause a 
serious reduction in the length of the contact.
Interference is the main disadvantage of involute 
gears. It is maximum when the smallest pinion is in 
mesh with the largest gear. The following methods 
can eliminate interference:
(i) Increase the Number of Teeth on the Pinion 
Increasing the number of teeth increases the size 
of the gearbox and also increases the pitch line 
velocity. This is not desirable. The minimum number 
of teeth to avoid interference and undercutting is as 
follows: 
For 14.5° full depth system 
32 teeth
For 20° full depth system 
17 teeth
For 20° stub system 
14 teeth
In case of generated gears, the number of teeth 
can be further reduced due to undercutting. 
(ii) Increase Pressure Angle This results in smaller 
base circle so that more portion of the tooth proﬁ le 
becomes involute.
(iii) Use Long and Short Addendum Gearing In this 
method, the addendum of the pinion is made longer 
than the standard addendum. Also, the addendum of 
the mating gear is made shorter than the standard 
addendum. However, this results in non-standard 
and non-interchangeable gears.
The best course to avoid interference is to avoid 
the theoretical conditions that result in overlapping 
proﬁ le of mating teeth, instead of undercutting.
17.10  BACKLASH
Backlash is deﬁ ned as the amount by which the 
width of tooth space exceeds the thickness of the 
engaging tooth measured along the pitch circle. It is 
illustrated in Fig. 17.19. In general, backlash is the 
play between mating teeth and it occurs only when 
teeth are in mesh. The objectives for providing 
backlash are as follows: 
 
(i) Backlash prevents the mating teeth from 
jamming together. The mating teeth do not 
make contact on both sides simultaneously. 
This makes the teeth roll together freely and 
smoothly.
 
(ii) Backlash 
compensates 
for 
machining 
errors.
 (iii) Backlash compensates for thermal expansion 
of teeth.
Fig. 17.19 Backlash
There are two methods to provide backlash. They 
are as follows:
 
(i) The teeth of the gear are cut slightly thinner. 
This is obtained by setting the cutting tool 
deeper into the blank resulting in thinner 
tooth and wider space.
 
(ii) The centre distance between mating gears is 
slightly increased.
The magnitude of recommended backlash 
depends upon the diametral pitch or module and the 
centre distance. The magnitude of backlash is very 
small for gear trains used in precision equipment 
and instruments.
The backlash and variation in centre distance 
have no effect on tooth action or velocity ratio.
17.11  FORCE ANALYSIS
In gears, power is transmitted by means of a force 
exerted by the tooth of the driving gear on the 
meshing tooth of the driven gear. Figure 17.20 
shows the tooth of the driving pinion exerting a force 
PN on the tooth of the driven gear. According to the 
fundamental law of gearing, this resultant force PN 
Spur Gears 659
always acts along the pressure line. The resultant 
force PN can be resolved into two components—
tangential component Pt and radial component Pr at 
the pitch point as shown in Fig. 17.21. The tangential 
component Pt is a useful load because it determines 
the magnitude of the torque and consequently the 
power, which is transmitted. The radial component

Pr is a separating force, which is always directed 
towards the centre of the gear. The torque transmitted 
by the gears is given by,

The above analysis of the gear tooth force is 
based on the following assumptions:
 
(i) As the point of contact moves, the magnitude 
of the resultant force PN changes. This effect 
is neglected in the above analysis.
 
(ii) It is assumed that only one pair of teeth takes 
the entire load. At times there are two pairs, 
which are simultaneously in contact and 
share the load. This aspect is neglected in 
the analysis.
 (iii) The analysis is valid under static conditions, 
i.e., when the gears are running at very low 
velocities. In practice, there is dynamic 
force in addition to force due to power 
transmission. The effect of this dynamic 
force is neglected in the analysis.
In examples of gear tooth forces, it is always 
required to ﬁ nd out the magnitude and direction of 
two components. The magnitudes are determined by

660 Design of Machine Elements
 
 Pr = Pt tan a 
where the sufﬁ x p is used for the pinion.
The directions of two components Pt and Pr are 
decided by constructing the free-body diagram as 
shown in Fig. 17.22.
Refer to Fig.17.22(a):
 
(i) It is assumed that the pinion is the driving 
element while gear is the driven element.
 
(ii) It is assumed that the pinion rotates in anti-
clockwise direction. Therefore, the gear will 
rotate in clockwise direction.
 (iii) In running condition, the point 2 on the 
pinion and the point 1 on gear are in contact 
with each other.
Refer to Fig.17.22(b):
 
(i) The gear G is the driven element. It is made 
to rotate in clockwise direction. Therefore, 
at point 1 on the gear G, the tangential 
component Pt will act towards the left.
 
(ii) There will be equal and opposite reaction at 
point 2 on the pinion P. It is observed that the 
direction of tangential component Pt on the 
driving element, that is, pinion is opposite to 
the direction of rotation.
Refer to Fig.17.22(c):
 
(i) The radial component acts towards the 
centre of the respective gear. For pinion 
P, the radial component Pr acts at point 2 
towards the centre O2.
 
(ii)  For the gear G, the radial component Pr acts 
at point 1 towards the centre O1.

Example 17.2 
The pitch circles of a train of spur 
gears are shown in Fig. 17.23. Gear A receives 
3.5 kW of power at 700 rpm through its shaft and 
rotates in the clockwise direction. Gear B is the idler 
gear while the gear C is the driven gear. The number 
of teeth on gears A, B and C are 30, 60 and 40 
respectively, while the module is 5 mm. Calculate
 
(i) the torque on each gear shaft; and
 
(ii) the components of gear tooth forces.

Draw a free-body diagram of forces and determine 
the reaction on the idler gear shaft. Assume 20°

The tangential component between gears B and C 
must be equal to the tangential component between 
gears A and B. Since the tangential components are 
equal, the radial components (Pt tan a) must be equal. 
Step III Free-body diagram of forces 
The free-body diagram of forces is shown in
Fig. 17.24. Gear A is rotating in the clockwise 
direction. It is a driving gear and the direction of 
tangential component is opposite to that of rotation. 
Therefore, the tangential component at the point-1 
on the gear A will act towards the upper right-hand 
corner of the page. Since the action and reaction are
Fig. 17.24 Free-body Diagram of Forces
equal and opposite, the tangential component at the 
point-2 on the gear B will act towards the lower left-
hand corner of the page. Between gears B and C, B 
is the driving gear and C is the driven gear. Gear C 
is rotating in the clockwise direction. The direction 
of tangential component for driven gear is same as 
that of rotation. Therefore, at the point-4 on the gear 
C, the tangential component will act towards the 
upper left-hand corner of the page. Since the action 
and reaction are equal and opposite, the tangential 
component at point-3 on the gear B will act towards 
lower right-hand corner of the page. The radial 
components at points 1, 2, 3 and 4 will act towards 
the centres of respective gears.
Step IV Reaction on idler gear shaft 
Consider the equilibrium of forces acting on the gear 
B, in two planes inclined at 45° to the vertical. The 
forces are acting at points 2 and 3 and their reactions 
at the shaft. Each component of the reaction RB on 
these planes is equal to (Pt + Pr). Therefore, the 
reaction RB on the idler gear shaft is given by,

The free-body diagram of forces is shown in
Fig. 17.26. Gear A is rotating in the clockwise 
direction. It is a driving gear and the direction of the 
tangential component is opposite to that of rotation. 
Therefore, the tangential component at point-1 on 
the gear A will act towards the left side of the page. 
Fig. 17.26
Since the action and reaction are equal and opposite, 
the tangential component at point-2 on the gear B 
will act towards the right side of the page. Gear C is 
ﬁ xed in the housing and will resist the motion of the 
gear B. Therefore, in relative terms, the gear B is the 
driving gear in relation to the gear C. The direction 
of tangential component for the driving gear is 
opposite to that of rotation. Therefore, at point-3 
on the gear B, the tangential component will act 
towards the right-hand side of the page. The radial 
components at points 1, 2 and 3 will act towards the 
centres of respective gears. 
Step II Torque that the arm D can deliver to its output 
shaft
Considering the equilibrium of horizontal forces 
acting on the gear B, the magnitude of reaction at 
point 5 will be (2Pt) and it will act towards the left 
side of the page. Since the action and reaction are 
equal and opposite, the tangential force at point-6 
on the arm D will be (2Pt) and it will act towards the 
right side of the page.
The torque about the axis O is given by,
Torque = 2Pt(LD) = 2(552.62)(180)
 
= 198 943 N-mm
or Torque = 198.94 N-m 
Example 17.4

spur gears E and C are integral with the shaft and 
rotate at the same speed. The spur gear A is the ﬁ xed

mm for all gears. The pressure angle is 20°. Assume 
that each planetary gear shares an equal part of 
load and neglect frictional losses. Calculate:

Refer to Fig. 17.27 for the ﬂ ow of power. B is 
the input pinion. Power is supplied from the pinion 
B to the gear C and then from the gear E to the gear 
F. Therefore, between gears E and F, the gear E is 
the driving gear and the gear F is the driven gear. 
The construction of a free-body diagram of forces is 
illustrated in Fig. 17.28. Let us denote F1 and F2 as 
upper and lower planetary gears F. 
Refer to Fig.17.28(a): 
 
(i) It is assumed that the gear E is rotating in the 
clockwise direction. Therefore, gears F1 and 
F2 will rotate in anti-clockwise direction. A 
is a ﬁ xed internal gear.
 
(ii) During working operation, the point 1 on the 
gear E and the point 2 on the gear F1 will be 
in contact with each other. Similarly, points 
3 and 4, points 5 and 6, and points 7 and 8 
will be in contact with each other.
Refer to Fig.17.28(b): 
 
(i) Gear F1 is the driven gear as compared to 
the gear E. It is made to rotate in the anti-
clockwise direction. Therefore, at the point 
2, the tangential component (Pt)EF will act 
towards the right. For this component, there 
will be an equal and opposite reaction on 
the gear E at the point 1. Therefore, the 
tangential component (Pt)EF will act towards 
left at the point 1 on gear E.
Fig. 17.28 Free Body Diagram of Forces
 
(ii) Gear F2 is also a driven gear as compared 
to the gear E. It is made to rotate in anti-
clockwise direction. Therefore, at the point 
4, the tangential component (Pt)EF will act 
towards the left. For this component, there 
will be equal and opposite reaction on the 
gear E at the point 3. Therefore, the tangential 
component (Pt)EF will act towards the right 
at the point 3 on the gear E.
 (iii) Gear A is ﬁ xed in the housing and will 
resist the motion of planetary gears F1 and 
F2. Therefore, in relative terms, gears F1 
and F2 are driving gears with respect to the 
gear A. For the driving gear, the tangential 
component acts in opposite direction of the 
motion. Therefore, at the point 5 on the gear 
F1, (Pt)FA will act towards the right. Similarly, 
664 Design of Machine Elements
at the point 7 on the gear F2, (Pt)FA will act 
towards the left.
 (iv) Gears F1 and F2 are planetary gears and 
do not transmit any torque to their pins. 
Considering the forces on the gear F1,
\ 
 (Pt)EF ¥ radius of F1 = (Pt)FA ¥ radius of F1 
or 
 (Pt)EF = (Pt)FA 
The pin of the gear F1 is subjected to a force 
2(Pt)EF towards the right. Similarly, it can be proved 
that the pin of the gear F2 is subjected to a force 
2(Pt)EF towards the left. The forces acting on the 
two pins are illustrated in Fig. 17.28(c). The pins are 
ﬁ xed to the drum. Therefore, the torque acting on

Spur Gears 665
The free-body diagram of forces acting on the shaft 
EF is shown in Fig. 17.30. The pinion-1 is rotating 
in anti-clockwise direction when observed from the 
left side of the page. Therefore, the gear-2 and the 
shaft EF are rotating in clockwise direction. Power 
is transmitted from the gear-1 to the gear-2, and then 
from gear-3 to the gear-4. Therefore, the gear-2 is 
driven gear and the gear-3 is the driving gear. The 
direction of tangential component for the driven gear 
is the same as that of rotation. Therefore, at the point 
of contact on the gear-2, the tangential component 
will act towards the lower right-hand corner of the 
page. The direction of tangential component for 
driving gear is opposite to that of rotation. Therefore, 
at the point of contact on the gear-3, the tangential 
component will act towards the upper left-hand 
corner of the page. The radial components will act 
towards the centres of respective gears.

17.12  GEAR TOOTH FAILURES
There are two basic modes of gear tooth failure—
breakage of the tooth due to static and dynamic 
loads and the surface destruction4, 5. The complete 
breakage of the tooth can be avoided by adjusting the 
666 Design of Machine Elements
parameters in the gear design, such as the module and 
the face width, so that the beam strength of the gear 
tooth is more than the sum of static and dynamic loads. 
The surface destruction or tooth wear is classiﬁ ed 
according to the basis of their primary causes. The 
principal types of gear tooth wear are as follows:
(i) Abrasive Wear Foreign particles in the lubricant, 
such as dirt, rust, weld spatter or metallic debris 
can scratch or brinell the tooth surface. Remedies 
against this type of wear are provision of oil ﬁ lters, 
increasing surface hardness and use of high viscosity 
oils. A thick lubricating ﬁ lm developed by these oils 
allows ﬁ ne particles to pass without scratching.
(ii) Corrosive Wear The corrosion of the tooth 
surface is caused by corrosive elements, such as 
extreme pressure additives present in lubricating oils 
and foreign materials due to external contamination. 
These elements attack the tooth surface, resulting 
in ﬁ ne wear uniformly distributed over the entire 
surface. Remedies against this type of wear are, 
providing complete enclosure for the gears free from 
external contamination, selecting proper additives 
and replacing the lubricating oil at regular intervals.
(iii) Initial Pitting The initial or corrective pitting 
is a localized phenomenon, characterized by small 
pits at high spots. Such high spots are progressively 
worn out and the load is redistributed. Initial pitting 
is caused by the errors in tooth proﬁ le, surface 
irregularities and misalignment. The remedies 
against initial pitting are precise machining of gears, 
adjusting the correct alignment of gears so that the 
load is uniformly distributed across the full face 
width, and reducing the dynamic loads.
(iv) Destructive Pitting Destructive pitting is a 
surface fatigue failure, which occurs when the load on 
the gear tooth exceeds the surface endurance strength 
of the material. This type of failure is characterized 
by pits, which continue to grow resulting in complete 
destruction of the tooth surface and, in some cases, 
even premature breakage of the tooth. Destructive 
pitting depends upon the magnitude of the Hertz’ 
contact stress and the number of stress cycles. This 
type of failure can be avoided by designing the gears 
in such a way that the wear strength of the gear tooth 
is more than the sum of static and dynamic loads. 
The surface endurance strength can be improved by 
increasing the surface hardness.
(v) Scoring Excessive surface pressure, high 
surface speed and inadequate supply of lubricant 
result in the breakdown of the oil ﬁ lm. This results 
in excessive frictional heat and overheating of the 
meshing teeth. Scoring is a stick-slip phenomenon, 
in which alternate welding and shearing takes place 
rapidly at the high spots. Here, the rate of wear is 
faster. Scoring can be avoided by selecting the 
parameters, such as surface speed, surface pressure 
and the ﬂ ow of lubricant in such a way that the 
resulting temperature at the contacting surfaces is 
within permissible limits. The bulk temperature of 
the lubricant can be reduced by providing ﬁ ns on the 
outside surface of the gear box and a fan for forced 
circu1ation of air over the ﬁ ns.
17.13  SELECTION OF MATERIAL
The desirable properties of gear material are as 
follows:
 
(i) The load carrying capacity of the gear tooth 
depends upon the ultimate tensile strength or 
the yield strength of the material. When the 
gear tooth is subjected to ﬂ uctuating forces, 
the endurance strength of the tooth is the 
deciding factor. The gear material should 
have sufﬁ cient strength to resist failure due 
to breakage of the tooth.
 
(ii) In many cases, it is ‘wear rating’ rather 
than ‘strength rating’ which decides the 
dimensions of the gear tooth. The resistance 
to wear depends upon alloying elements, 
grain size, percentage of carbon, and surface 
hardness. The gear material should have 
sufﬁ cient surface endurance strength to 
avoid failure due to destructive pitting. 
 (iii) For high-speed power transmission, the 
sliding velocities are very high and the 
material should have low coefﬁ cient of 
friction to avoid failure due to scoring.
 (iv) The amount of thermal distortion or warping 
during the heat treatment process is a major 
problem in gear applications. Due to warping, 
the load gets concentrated at one corner of 
the gear tooth. Alloy steels are superior to 
plain carbon steels in this respect, due to 
consistent thermal distortion.
Spur Gears 667
Gears are made of cast iron, steel, bronze and 
phenolic resins. Large size gears are made of grey 
cast iron of Grades FG 200, FG 260 or FG 350. They 
are cheap and generate less noise compared with 
steel gears. They have good wear resistance. Their 
main drawback is poor strength. Case-hardened 
steel gears offer the best combination of a wear-
resisting hard surface together with a ductile and 
shock- absorbing core. The plain carbon steels used 
for medium duty applications are 50C8, 45C8, 50C4 
and 55C8. For heavy duty applications, alloy steels 
4OCrl, 30Ni4Cr1 and 4ONi3Cr65Mo55 are used. 
For planetary gear trains, alloy steel 35NilCr60 
is recommended. Although steel gears are costly, 
they have higher load carrying capacity. Bronze 
is mainly used for worm wheels due to its low 
coefﬁ cient of friction and excellent conformability. 
It is also suitable where resistance to corrosion is an 
important consideration in applications like water 
pumps. Their main drawback is excessive cost. 
Non-metallic gears are used under the following 
conditions: 
 
(i) The load is light and the pitch line velocity is 
low.
 
(ii) A long life is expected.
 (iii) It is required to have quiet operation free 
from noise and vibrations.
 (iv) The gears are likely to be affected by water 
and oil. 
In non-metallic gear drives, only the pinion is 
made of non-metals such as molded nylon, laminated 
phenolics like Bakelite or Celoron. The non-
metallic pinions generally run with cast iron gears. 
Gears made of phenolic resins have low modulus 
of elasticity and work on marginal lubrication. They 
can tolerate errors in the tooth proﬁ le.
17.14 GEAR BLANK DESIGN
Depending on the purpose and the size, there are 
different constructions for gears. These constructions 
are broadly classiﬁ ed into the following three groups:
 
(i) Small size gears;
 
(ii) Medium size gears; and
 (iii) gears with large diameter.
In this article, we will consider the salient features 
of these constructions.
(i) Small Sized Gears A pinion with root diameter 
near to the required diameter of the shaft is made 
integral with the shaft. This type of construction is 
shown in Fig. 17.32. The rule of thumb for making 
integral gear is as follows:
‘If the diameter of dedendum circle (df) exceeds 
the diameter of the shaft (ds), at the point where 
the pinion is ﬁ tted, by less than (ds/2), the pinion is 
made integral with the shaft’.
Fig. 17.32 Integral Gear
The dimensions of the pinion are as follows:
 
(a) Pitch circle diameter = d ¢ = mz 
 
(b) Addendum circle diameter = da = d¢ + 2ha = 
mz + 2(m) = m(z + 2)
 
(c) Dedendum circle diameter = df = d¢ – 2hf = 
mz – 2(1.25 m) = m(z – 2.5)
 
(d) Shaft diameter = ds
 
(e) Width of gear = face width = b
The advantages of integral construction are as 
follows:
 
(a) It reduces the amount of machining since 
there is no need to cut keyways on the shaft 
and the pinion.
 
(b) It reduces the number of parts since there is 
no key. This reduces the cost.
 
(c) It increases the rigidity of the shaft and also 
increases the accuracy of contact.
However, integral construction can be used only 
when the size of pinion is small. If the diameter of 
dedendum circle is considerably larger than the shaft 
diameter, the pinion is made separate from the shaft.
(ii) Medium Sized Gears There are two methods 
to manufacture medium size gears. They include 
machining from bar stock and forging. Gears of 
addendum circle diameter up to 150 mm are machined 
on rolled steel bars. The gear blanks in this case are 
turned on lathe. Gears of addendum circle diameter 
668 Design of Machine Elements
from 150 mm to 400 mm are mostly forged in open 
or closed dies. It again depends upon the volume of 
production. Even small diameter gears are forged, 
if the volume of production is large. Forged gears 
offer the following advantages:
 
(a) The factor of material utilisation is equal to 
(1/3) when the gear is machined from bar 
stock. In case of forgings, material utilization 
factor is (2/3), which is twice. This reduces 
the cost of the material.
 
(b) Forged gear has lightweight construction 
which reduces inertia and centrifugal forces.
 
(c) The ﬁ bre lines of the forged gears are 
arranged in a predetermined way to suit 
the direction of external force. In case of 
gears, prepared by machining methods, the 
original ﬁ bre lines of rolled stock are broken. 
Therefore, the forged gear is inherently 
strong compared with machined gear.
The limiting factor governing the choice of 
forged gears is their high cost. The equipment and 
tooling required to make forged gears is costly. 
Forged gears become economical only when they 
are manufactured on large scale.
Figure. 17.33 shows a gear in the form of a ﬂ at 
circular disk, which is machined from bar stock. The 
gear blank in this case is turned on the lathe. This 
type of construction is used for gears with addendum 
circle diameter up to 150 mm or when the gears are 
manufactured on small scale. It is more economical 
than forged gear. 
Fig. 17.33 Machined Gear
The main dimensions of the gear blank are as 
follows:
 
(a) Pitch circle diameter = d¢ = mz 
 
(b) Addendum circle diameter = da = m(z + 2)
 
(c) Dedendum circle diameter = df  = m(z – 2.5)
 
(d) Shaft diameter = ds
 
(e) Width of gear = face width = b
The construction of a forged gear is shown in 
Fig. 17.34. It is made of three parts—hub, web and 
rim. The web connects the hub with the rim. Holes 
are provided in the web for clamping the gear blank 
during machining. It also reduces the weight. The 
inner surface of the rim and the outer surface of the
Fig. 17.34 Forged Gear
hub are provided with draft for easy removal from 
the dies. The dimensions of forged gears are based 
on the following thumb rules:
 
(a) The thickness of the rim (tr) up to the root 
circle diameter is taken as (2m) to (3m).
 
(b) The thickness of web (b1) is taken as (0.2b) 
to (0.3b).
 
(c) The outer diameter of hub (d1) is taken as 
(1.5ds) to (2.0ds).
The main dimensions of the gear blank of forged 
gear are as follows:
 
(a) Pitch circle diameter = d ¢ = mz 
 
(b) Addendum circle diameter = da = m(z + 2)
 
(c) Dedendum circle diameter = df = m(z – 2.5)
 
(d) Shaft diameter = ds
 
(e) Outer diameter of hub = d1 = (1.5ds) to (2.0ds)
Spur Gears 669
 
(f) Length of hub = length of key or width of 
gear (maximum value)
 
(g) Width of web = b1 = (0.2b) to (0.3b)
 
(h) Inner diameter of rim = d3 = (df – 2tr)
 
(i) Outer diameter of rim = dedendum circle 
diameter = df
 
(j) Thickness of rim = tr = 2m to 3m
 
(k) Diameter of holes in web = d4 = (d3 – d1)/4
 
(l) Pitch circle diameter of holes = d2 = (d3 + d1)/2
 (m) Width of rim = face width = b
Whatever the computed dimensions, care should 
be taken to make the gear a ‘sound’ forging and 
modify the dimensions, if required. The guidelines 
for designing a forging are explained in Section 3.3 
on Design considerations of Forgings. These rules 
related to uniform thickness, minimum section 
thickness, ﬁ llet and corner radii and provision of draft 
must be applied to ﬁ nal drawing of gear blank.
(iii) Gears with Large Diameter There are two 
varieties of large size gearssolid cast gears and 
rimmed gears. When the addendum circle diameter
is up to 900 mm, a solid cast iron gear with one web
is recommended. When the addendum circle diameter 
is more than 1000 mm, two webs are provided. A 
solid cast gear with two webs is shown in Fig. 17.35. 
Solid cast iron gears are extensively used due to low 
cost. Though cast iron gears are cheaper than steel 
gears, their torque transmitting capacity is low. The 
dimensions of cast iron gears are determined by 
thumb rules and principles of casting design.
Fig. 17.35 Cast Iron Web Type Gear
The main dimensions of cast iron gear, illustrated 
in Fig. 17.35 are as follows:
 
(a) Pitch circle diameter = d¢ = mz 
 
(b) Addendum circle diameter = da = m(z + 2)
 
(c) Dedendum circle diameter = df  = m(z – 2.5)
 
(d) Shaft diameter = ds
 
(e) Outer diameter of hub = d1 = 2.0ds 
 
(f) Length of hub = (1.25 ds) to (2.0 ds)
 
  
= length of key 
 
(g) Width of web = c = 0.5 to 0.6 of circular 
pitch
 
(h) Inner diameter of rim = d2 = (df  – 2tr)
 
(i) Outer diameter of rim = dedendum circle 
diameter = df
 
(j) Thickness of rim = tr = 0.56 ¥ circular pitch
 
(k) Width of rim = face width = b
Whatever the computed values of dimensions, 
care should be taken to make the gear a ‘sound’ 
casting and modify the dimensions, if required. The 
guidelines for designing a casting are explained in 
Section 3.2 on Design considerations of Casting. 
These rules related to uniform thickness, minimum 
section thickness, ﬁ llet and corner radii and avoiding 
concentration of metal at any junction must be 
applied to the ﬁ nal drawing of gear blank.
A rimmed gear consists of a steel rim ﬁ tted on 
the central casting with hub, arms or webs. The rim 
is forged from alloy steel. There are two varieties 
of rimmed gears, which are illustrated in Figs 17.36 
(a) and (b). In the ﬁ rst case, the rim is press ﬁ tted 
on the casting and setscrews are used to prevent 
displacement of the rim with respect to casting. In 
the second type of construction, the rim is bolted 
to the central casting. Rimmed gears save costly 
high strength material, but they are more expensive 
to manufacture. The thickness of the rim from the 
inside diameter to the root circle diameter of tooth is 
usually taken as (7m) to (8m).
Fig. 17.36 Rimmed Gears
670 Design of Machine Elements
When the pitch circle diameter of cast iron gear 
is large, arms are used in place of web. The arms are 
also called spokes. The cross-section of an arm can 
be elliptical, I-section, H-section or cross (+). The 
recommended number of arms is as follows:
Pitch circle diameter (mm)
Number of arms (n)
300 – 500
  4
500 – 1500
  6
1500 – 2400
  8
> 2400
10–12
In some cases, it is required to design the cross-
section of the arm. Figure 17.37 shows the arm of a 
cast iron gear. The analysis is based on the following 
assumptions:
 
(a) The arm is assumed as a cantilever beam, 
ﬁ xed at the hub and subjected to a force P at 
the pitch line.
 
(b) The rim is rigid so that each arm takes equal 
share of total tooth load.
Fig. 17.37
The transmitted torque produces bending moment 
on arm. Suppose,
 
Mt = transmitted torque (N-mm)
 
n = number of arms 
 
P = force acting on each arm (N)
 
L = length of cantilever beam (mm)

by,

A higher factor of safety should be used because 
the above method is approximate, the assumptions 
are not exactly valid and stress concentration is 
neglected. The cross-section of arm is given a taper 
1:16 from the hub to the rim.
17.15 NUMBER OF TEETH
In the design of gears, it is required to decide the 
number of teeth on the pinion and gear. There is a 
limiting value of the minimum number of teeth on 
the pinion. As the number of teeth decreases, a point 
is reached when there is interference and the standard 
tooth proﬁ le requires modiﬁ cation. The minimum 
number of teeth to avoid interference is given by,
 
zmin.
sin
=
2
2 a  
 (17.12)
In practice, giving a slight radius to the tip of tooth 
can further reduce the value of zmin. Theoretical and 
practical values of the minimum number of teeth on 
the pinion are as follows:

11 
 zmin. (practical)
 27

9 
For the 20° full-depth involute tooth system, it 
is always safe to assume the number of teeth on 
the pinion as 18 or 20. This does not require any 
modiﬁ cation in the proﬁ le. Once the number of teeth 
on the pinion is decided, the number of teeth on the 
gear is calculated by the velocity ratio (i = zg /zp).
There is a concept of ‘hunting’ tooth for uniform 
distribution of tooth wear. Suppose (zp = 20) and (zg 
= 40), then after every two revolutions of the pinion, 
the same pair of teeth will engage. If however, we 
take (zp = 20) and (zg = 41), the pinion will rotate 
41 times before the same pair of teeth will engage 
again. This extra tooth is called the hunting tooth. 
It results in more even distribution of wear. For the 
provision of hunting tooth, it should be permissible 
to alter the velocity ratio slightly.
In a multi-stage gearbox consisting of two or 
three stages, the velocity ratio at each stage should 
not exceed 6 : 1. The intermediate speeds, in this 
case, are arranged in geometric progression. If i ¢ is 
the total transmission ratio, i.e., the ratio of angular 
velocity of the ﬁ rst driving gear to that of the last 
driven gear, then the speed reduction at each stage 
(i) is obtained in the following way.
For two stages,
 
i
i
=
¢  
(17.13)
For three stages,
 
i
i
=
¢
3
 
 (17.14)
As the number of teeth increases, the pitch circle 
diameter and the size of the gear wheel also increase, 
thus increasing the cost. Therefore, the number of 
teeth on the pinion as well as on the gear should be 
kept as small as possible.
17.16 FACE WIDTH
In the design of gears, it is required to express the 
face width in terms of the module. In the Lewis 
equation, it is assumed that the tangential force Pt 
is uniformly distributed over the entire face width. 
If the face width is too large, there is a possibility 
of concentration of load at one end of the gear tooth 
due to a number of factors, like misalignment, elastic 
deformation of shafts, and warping of gear tooth. 
On the other hand, gears with a small face width 
have a poor capacity to resist the shock and absorb 
vibrations. They also wear at a faster rate. A narrow 
face width results in a coarse pitch. In practice, the 
optimum range of the face width is
 
(8 m) < b < (12 m) 
(17.15)
In the preliminary stages of gear design, the face 
width is assumed as ten times of module.
Example 17.6 
The layout of a two-stage gearbox 
is shown in Fig. 17.38. The number of teeth on gears 
1,2,3 and 4 are z1, z2, z3 and z4 respectively. The 
module for all gears is m. The total transmission 
ratio, i.e., the ratio of angular velocity of the gear-
1 to that of the gear-4, is i. The velocity ratios of 
the ﬁ rst and second stages are i1 and i2 respectively.

17.17 BEAM STRENGTH OF GEAR 
TOOTH
The analysis of bending stresses in gear tooth 
was done by Wilfred Lewis in his paper, ‘The 
investigation of the strength of gear tooth’ submitted 
at the Engineer’s Club of Philadelphia in 1892. Even 
today, the Lewis equation is considered as the basic 
equation in the design of gears. In the Lewis analysis, 
the gear tooth is treated as a cantilever beam as 
shown in Fig. 17.39. The tangential component (Pt) 
causes the bending moment about the base of the 
tooth. The Lewis equation is based on the following 
assumptions:
 
(i)  The effect of the radial component (Pr), 
which induces compressive stresses, is 
neglected.
 
(ii)  It is assumed that the tangential component 
(Pt) is uniformly distributed over the face 
width of the gear. This is possible when the 
gears are rigid and accurately machined.
 (iii)  The effect of stress concentration is 
neglected.
 (iv)  It is assumed that at any time, only one pair of 
teeth is in contact and takes the total load.
Fig. 17.39 Gear Tooth as Cantilever
It is observed that the cross-section of the tooth 
varies from the free end to the ﬁ xed end. Therefore, 
a parabola is constructed within the tooth proﬁ le and 
shown by a dotted line in Fig. 17.40. The advantage 
of parabolic outline is that it is a beam of uniform 
strength. For this beam, the stress at any cross-

section is uniform or same. The weakest section 
of the gear tooth is at the section XX, where the 
parabola is tangent to the tooth proﬁ le.

the equation is rewritten as,
 
 Pt = mbsbY 
 (a)
In the above equation, Y is called the Lewis form 
factor. Equation (a) gives the relationship between 
the tangential force (Pt) and the corresponding 
stress sb. When the tangential force is increased, 
the stress also increases. When the stress reaches 
the permissible magnitude of bending stresses, the 
corresponding force (Pt) is called the beam strength. 
Therefore, the beam strength (Sb) is the maximum 
value of the tangential force that the tooth can 
transmit without bending failure. Replacing (Pt) by 
(Sb), Eq. (a) is modiﬁ ed in the following way:
 
Sb = mbsbY 
(17.16)
where,
 
Sb = beam strength of gear tooth (N)
 
σb = permissible bending stress (N/mm2)
Equation 17.16 is known as the Lewis Equation. 
The values of the Lewis form factor Y for 20° full-
depth involute system, are given in Table 17.3. In 
order to avoid the breakage of gear tooth due to 
bending, the beam strength should be more than the 
effective force between the meshing teeth.
Therefore,
 
Sb ≥ Peff
The method of calculating of Peff is discussed in 
Section 17.19. In the design of gears, it is required to 
decide the weaker between the pinion and gear.
Rewriting the Lewis equation,
 
Sb = mbsbY
It is observed that m and b are same for pinion as 
well as for gear. When different materials are used, 
the product (sb ¥ Y) decides the weaker between 
pinion and gear. The Lewis form factor Y is always 
less for a pinion compared with gear. When the same 
material is used for the pinion and gear, the pinion is 
always weaker than the gear.

PERMISSIBLE BENDING STRESS
The tooth of the gear is subjected to ﬂ uctuating 
bending stress as it comes in contact with the 
meshing tooth. The stress–time diagrams for gear 
teeth are illustrated in Fig. 17.41. The following 
observations are made from the ﬁ gure:
 
(i) The teeth of the driving and driven gears are 
subjected to stress in one direction only as 
674 Design of Machine Elements
shown in Fig. 17.41(b). It is called ‘repeated’ 
stress. For this type of stress distribution,

where,
 
smax. = maximum bending stress
 sm  = mean stress
 sa  = stress amplitude

(ii) The teeth of the idler gear or planetary pinion 
are subjected to stress in both directions as 
shown in Fig. 17.41(c). It is called ‘reversed’ 
stress. For this type of stress distribution,
sm = 0  and sa = smax.
Since the teeth are subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses, 
endurance limit stress (Se) is the criterion of design. 
Therefore, the maximum bending stress is equal 
to the endurance limit stress of the gear tooth. The 
endurance limit stress of the gear tooth depends 
upon the following factors:
 
(i) Surface ﬁ nish of the gear tooth
 
(ii) Size of the gear tooth
 (iii) Reliability used in design
 (iv) Stress concentration in the gear tooth
 
(v) Gears rotating in one direction or both 
directions
 (vi) Gears tooth subjected to stress in one 
direction or both directions
In practice, it is difﬁ cult to get the above-
mentioned data for each and every case of gear design. 
Earle Buckingham has suggested that the endurance 
limit stress of gear tooth is approximately one-third 
of the ultimate tensile strength of the material. In 
this chapter, we will use this approximate value.

17.19 EFFECTIVE LOAD ON GEAR 
TOOTH
In Section 17.11, a method to determine the 
tangential component of the resultant force between 
two meshing teeth is discussed. The component is 
calculated by using the following two equations:

The value of the tangential component, therefore, 
depends upon the rated power and rated speed. In 
practical applications, the torque developed by 
the source of power varies during the work cycle. 
Similarly, the torque required by the driven machine 
also varies. The two sides are balanced by means 
of a ﬂ ywheel. In gear design, the maximum force 
(due to maximum torque) is the criterion. This is 
accounted by means of a service factor. The service 
factor Cs is deﬁ ned as
 
Cs = maximum torque

When gears rotate at very low speed, almost 
at zero velocity, the transmitted load (Pt) can be 
considered to be the actual force present between two 
meshing teeth. However, in most of the cases, the 
gears rotate at an appreciable speed and it becomes 
necessary to consider the dynamic force resulting 
from the impact between mating teeth. The dynamic 
force is induced due to the following factors:
 
(i)  inaccuracies of the tooth proﬁ le;
 
(ii)  errors in tooth spacing;
 (iii)  misalignment between bearings;
 (iv)  elasticity of parts; and
 
(v)  inertia of rotating disks.
There are two methods to account for the dynamic 
load—approximate estimation by the velocity factor 
in the preliminary stages of gear design and precise 
calculation by Buckingham’s equation in the ﬁ nal 
stages of gear design.
It is difﬁ cult to calculate the exact magnitude 
of dynamic load in the preliminary stages of gear 
design. To overcome this difﬁ culty, a velocity factor 
Cv developed by Barth is used. The values of the 
velocity factor are as follows:

The velocity factor is an empirical relationship 
developed by past experience. This method 
of calculating dynamic load has the following 
advantages:
 
(i) It is much easier to calculate the velocity 
factor and design gears.
 
(ii) Velocity factors have sanctions of the 
American Gear Manufacturing Association 
(AGMA)
 (iii) They were used in the past for many years 
and given satisfactory results.
The disadvantages of the velocity factor method 
are as follows:
 
(i) The dynamic load depends upon a number 
of factors such as the mass of gears, mass 
connected to the gear shaft and properties 
of the gear material, like modulus of a 
elasticity. A gear tooth of a material with 
low modulus of elasticity will deﬂ ect more 
than the gear tooth of a material with higher 
modulus of elasticity, and other things being 
equal, will absorb the energy of impact and 
reduce the dynamic load. Velocity factor 
method neglects these factors. It assumes 
that dynamic load depends only upon pitch 
line velocity.
 
(ii) Use of velocity factor is restricted to a 
limited range of pitch line velocities. It is not 
possible to extrapolate the values.
In the ﬁ nal stages of gear design, when gear 
dimensions are known, errors speciﬁ ed and the 
quality of gears determined, the dynamic load 
is calculated by equations derived by Earle 
Buckingham. The effective load is given by,
 
 Peff = (Cs Pt + Pd) 
 (17.25)
where, (Pd) is the dynamic load or additional load 
due to dynamic conditions between two meshing 
teeth. Buckingham has used a term ‘incremental 
dynamic load’ for ( Pd). The dynamic load6 is given

The values of k for various tooth forms are as

The incremental dynamic load (Pd) calculated 
by Buckingham’s equation is far more than the 
corresponding load calculated by the velocity factor 
method. Very often, it is three to four times the load 
(Pt) due to power transmission. It has been observed 
that in most of the practical cases, the actual dynamic 
load is less than that of the calculated values by 
Buckingham’s equation. This is because the equation 
is mainly applicable to large gears with connected 
masses that rotate at moderate speeds. The actual 
dynamic load is less in the following cases:
 
(i) small gears transmitting low power;
 
(ii) high-speed light-load gears;
 (iii) small gears on small shaft;
 (iv) gear shafts up to 50 mm diameter; and
 
(v) small gears transmitting less than 15 kW of 
power.
Gears on small-diameter shaft easily twist 
through an angle equivalent to the effective tooth 
error and the dynamic load is reduced.
The error e in Eq. (17.26) is given by,
 
e = ep + eg 
(17.28)
where,
 
ep = error for pinion
 
eg = error for gear 
The error depends upon the quality of the gear 
and the method of manufacture. There are twelve 
different grades from Gr. 1 to Gr. 12 in decreasing 
order of precision7. The expected error on the gear 
tooth is considered to be equal to tolerance. 
The tolerances for adjacent pitch error (e) are 
given in Table 17.8. These tolerances are calculated 
by using the following basic equation:
 
 f = m + 0.25 
d¢  
 (17.29)
where,
 
 f = tolerance factor
 
m = module (mm)
 
d ¢ = pitch circle diameter (mm)

The method of manufacture for gears depends upon 
the grade of the gear. Gears of Grade 11 and Grade 
12 are manufactured by casting. Gears of Grade 8 
and Grade 9 require rough and ﬁ ne hobbing. Gears of 
Grade 6 are obtained by hobbing and rough grinding, 
while Grade 4 requires shaving and ﬁ nish grinding.

17.21 WEAR STRENGTH OF GEAR 
TOOTH
The failure of the gear tooth due to pitting occurs 
when the contact stresses between two meshing 
teeth exceed the surface endurance strength of 
the material. Pitting is a surface fatigue failure, 
characterized by small pits on the surface of the 
gear tooth. In order to avoid this type of failure, the 
proportions of the gear tooth and surface properties, 
such as surface hardness, should be selected in such 
a way that the wear strength of the gear tooth is more 
than the effective load between the meshing teeth. 
The analysis of wear strength was done by Earle 
Buckingham, in his paper ‘The relation of load to 
wear of gear teeth’, which was submitted before 
the American Gear Manufacturing Association 
(AGMA) in 1926. Buckingham’s equation gives the 
wear strength of the gear tooth.
Buckingham’s equation is based on Hertz theory 
of contact stresses. When two cylinders are pressed 
together as shown in Fig. 17.42(a), the contact stress 
is given by,

The above equation of the contact stress is based 
on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The cylinders are made of isotropic materials.
 
(ii) The elastic limit of the material is not 
exceeded.
 (iii) The dimensions r1, r2 are very large 
when compared to the width (2b) of the 
deformation.
Figure 17.43 shows the contact between two 
meshing teeth at the pitch point. The radii r1 and r2 
Fig. 17.43
in Eq. (d) are to be replaced by the radii of curvature 
at the pitch point. Therefore,
r

There are two reasons for taking the radii of 
curvature at the pitch point. The wear on the gear 
tooth generally occurs at or near the pitch line. 
When only one pair of teeth carries the entire load, 
the contact occurs at the pitch point. When the 
contact takes place at the top or at the bottom of 
the tooth proﬁ le, usually two pairs of meshing teeth 
share the load. The dynamic load is imposed on the 
gear tooth near the pitch line area. Therefore, it is 
more reasonable to select the radii of curvature at 
the pitch point.

       (m)
This equation gives a relationship between 
the tangential force Pt and the correspond ing 
contact stress sc (or K). When the tangential force 
is increased, the contact stress also increases. 
Pitting occurs when the contact stress reaches the 
magnitude of the surface endurance strength. The 
corresponding value of Pt is called wear strength. 
Therefore, the wear strength is the maximum value 
of the tangential force that the tooth can transmit 
without pitting failure. Replacing (Pt) by (Sw), Eq. 
(m) is written as,
 
Sw = bQd¢p K 
 (17.33)
where,
  Sw = wear strength of the gear tooth (N)
sc = surface endurance strength of the material 
 
(N/mm2 )
Equation (17.33) is known as Buckingham’s 
equation for wear. The ratio factor for internal gears 
is deﬁ ned as,

The expression for the load-stress factor K can

with a 20° pressure angle. In this special case,
E1 = E2 = 206 000 N/mm2  
 
 
 
a = 20° 
According to G Niemann,8
 
sc = 0.27 (BHN) kgf/mm2

In other cases, Eq. (17.32) should be used. Table 
17.9 gives the material properties for the calculation 
of K. In order to avoid failure of the gear tooth due 
to pitting, the wear strength should be more than the 
effective force between the meshing teeth.

Example 17.7 
It is required to design a pair of 
spur gears with 20° full-depth involute teeth based 
on the Lewis equation. The velocity factor is to be 
used to account for dynamic load. The pinion shaft is 
connected to a 10 kW, 1440 rpm motor. The starting 
torque of the motor is 150% of the rated torque. 
The speed reduction is 4 : 1. The pinion as well as 
the gear is made of plain carbon steel 40C8 (Sut = 
600 N/mm2). The factor of safety can be taken as 
1.5. Design the gears, specify their dimensions and 
suggest suitable surface hardness for the gears.
Solution
Given kW = 10 n = 1440 rpm i = 4 
 
Sut = 600 N/mm2 (fs) = 1.5
 
starting torque = 150% (rated torque)
Step I Estimation of module based on beam strength
Since both gears are made of the same material, the 
pinion is weaker than the gear. The minimum number 
of teeth for 20° pressure angle is 18. Therefore,
 
zp = 18
 
zg = i zp = 4(18) = 72

Example 17.8 
It is required to design a pair 
of spur gears with 20° full-depth involute teeth 
consisting of a 20-teeth pinion meshing with a 50 
teeth gear. The pinion shaft is connected to a 22.5 
kW, 1450 rpm electric motor. The starting torque of 
the motor can be taken as 150% of the rated torque. 
The material for the pinion is plain carbon steel Fe 
410 (Sut = 410 N/mm2), while the gear is made of 
grey cast iron FG 200 (Sut =200 N/mm2). The factor 
of safety is 1.5. Design the gears based on the Lewis 
equation and using velocity factor to account for the 
dynamic load.
Solution
Given kW = 22.5 n = 1450 rpm zp = 20
zg = 50 starting torque = 150% (rated torque) 
(fs) = 1.5 For pinion, 
Sut = 410 N/mm2
For gear, Sut = 200 N/mm2
Step I Deciding weaker between pinion and gear
The materials of pinion and gear are different. From 
Table 17.3, the Lewis form factors for 20 and 50 
teeth are 0.32 and 0.408 respectively.
For pinion,

gear is weaker than the pinion and it is necessary to 
design the gear.

The design is satisfactory and the module should 
be 7 mm.
Example 17.9 
A pair of spur gears with 20° 
full-depth involute teeth consists of a 19 teeth 
pinion meshing with a 40 teeth gear. The pinion is 
mounted on a crankshaft of 7.5 kW single cylinder 
diesel engine running at 1500 rpm. The driven shaft 
is connected to a two-stage compressor. Assume 
the service factor as 1.5. The pinion as well as the 
gear is made of steel 40C8 (Sut = 600 N/mm2). The 
module and face width of the gears are 4 and 40 mm 
respectively.
 
(i) Using the velocity factor to account for the 
dynamic load, determine the factor of safety.
 
(ii)  If the factor of safety is two for pitting failure, 
recommend surface hardness for the gears.
 (iii)  If the gears are machined to meet the 
speciﬁ cations of Grade 8, determine the factor 
of safety for bending using Buckingham’s 
equation for dynamic load.
 (iv) Is the gear design satisfactory? If not, what is 
the method to satisfy the design conditions? 
How will you modify the design?
Solution
Given kW = 7.5 n = 1500 rpm zp = 19
zg = 40 m = 4 mm b = 40 mm Cs = 1.5
Sut = 600 N/mm2 Grade of machining - 8
Step I Factor of safety based on dynamic load by velocity 
factor
Beam strength
Since both gears are made of the same material, the 
pinion is weaker than the gear. The Lewis form factor 
for 19 teeth is 0.314 (Table 17.3). The permissible 
bending stress is one-third of the ultimate tensile 
strength or 200 N/mm2. Therefore,
Sb = mbsbY = 4(40)(200)(0.314) = 10  048 N

The design is unsatisfactory both from the 
standpoint of strength and wear. 
Step IV Modiﬁ cation of design
We will select a ﬁ ner grade for the manufacture 
to reduce the dynamic load. It is assumed that the 
gears are manufactured according to Grade 6. For 
this grade,
 
e = 8 + 0.63 f
For pinion,
 
f = m + 0.25 
¢
d p  = 4 + 0.25 
76  
 
 ep = 8 + 0.63 f = 11.893 mm

Example 17.10 A pair of spur gears with 20° 
full-depth involute teeth consists of a 20 teeth 
pinion meshing with a 41 teeth gear. The module is 
3 mm while the face width is 40 mm. The material 
for pinion as well as gear is steel with an ultimate 
tensile strength of 600 N/mm2. The gears are heat-
treated to a surface hardness of 400 BHN. The 
 pinion rotates at 1450 rpm and the service factor 
for the application is 1.75. Assume that velocity 
factor accounts for the dynamic load and the factor 
of safety is 1.5.
Determine the rated power that the gears can 
transmit.
Solution
Given n = 1450 rpm zp = 20 zg = 41
m = 3 mm b = 40 mm Cs = 1.75 (fs) = 1.5
BHN = 400 Sut = 600 N/mm2
Step I Beam strength
Since the same material is used for the pinion and the 
gear, the pinion is weaker than the gear. From Table 
17.3, the Lewis form factor is 0.32 for 20 teeth.

Example 17.11 It is required to design a spur gear 
speed reducer for a compressor running at 250 rpm 
driven by a 7.5 kW, 1000 rpm electric motor. The 
centre distance between the axes of the gear shafts 
should be exactly 250 mm. The starting torque of 
the motor can be assumed to be 150% of the rated 
torque. The gears are made of carbon steel 50C4 
(Sut = 700 N/mm2). The pressure angle is 20°. The 
factor of safety is 2 for preliminary design based on 
the use of velocity factor.
 
(i) Design 
the 
gears 
and 
specify 
their 
dimensions.
 
(ii) Assume that the gears are manufactured 
to meet the requirements of Grade 6 
and calculate the dynamic load by using 
Buckingham’s equation.
 (iii) Calculate the effective load. 
 (iv) What is the actual factor of safety against 
bending failure? 
  (v) Using the same factor of safety against pitting 
failure, specify suitable surface hardness for 
the gears.
Solution
Given kW = 7.5 np = 1000 rpm
 
ng = 250 rpm a = 250 mm
 
starting torque = 150% (rated torque)

Example 17.12 It is required to design a two-
stage spur gear reduction unit with 20° full-depth 
involute teeth. The input shaft rotates at 1440 
rpm and receives 10 kW power through a ﬂ exible 
coupling. The speed of the output shaft should be 
approximately 180 rpm. The gears are made of plain 
carbon steel 45C8 (Sut = 700 N/mm2) and heat-
treated to a surface hardness of 340 BHN. The gears 
are to be machined to the requirement, of Grade 6. 
The service factor can be taken as 1.5.
 
(i) Assuming that the dynamic load to be 
proportional to the pitch-line velocity, 
estimate the required value of the module. 
The factor of safety is 1.5.
 
(ii) Select the ﬁ rst preference value of the module 
and determine the correct value of factor 
of safety for bending, using Buckingham’s 
equation.
 (iii)  Determine the factor of safety against 
pitting.
 (iv)  Give a list of gear dimensions.
Spur Gears 687
Solution
Given kW = 10 n = 1440 rpm Cs = 1.5
Sut = 700 N/mm2 (fs) = 1.5 BHN = 340
Grade of machining = 6
speed of output shaft = 180 rpm

17.23 INTERNAL GEARS
An internal gear has teeth which are cut on the 
inside of the rim as shown in Fig. 17.45. It is also 
called annular gear or ring gear. The shape of the 
tooth of internal gear corresponds to the tooth space 
of external gear of the same pitch circle diameter. 
Similarly, the tooth space of internal gear corresponds 
to the shape of the tooth of external gear.
Internal gears offer the following advantages:
 
(i) The centre to centre distance between the 
axes of external pinion and internal gear is 
small. This results in compact construction 
as compared to a pair of external gears.
 
(ii) There are more number of teeth in contact 
between external pinion and internal gear. 
Spur Gears 689
Each pair shares the load simultaneously. 
The load is not shifted abruptly from one 
pair to another like external spur gears. This 
results in smooth and quiet operation.
Fig. 17.45 Internal Gear
The disadvantages of internal gears are as 
follows:
 
(i) The internal gears are costly as compared 
with external gears.
 
(ii) The assembly of internal gears is more 
difﬁ cult than that of external spur gears.
Internal gears are used in compact speed reducer. 
They are mainly used in planetary gear trains.
In the design of internal gears, the following 
guidelines should be used:
 
(i) In order to avoid interference, the number of 
teeth on internal gear should be considerably 
more than the number of teeth on the 
external pinion. The minimum difference 
(zg–zp) between the teeth of internal gear and 
external pinion should be as follows:
 
  8 teeth for 20° stub tooth form
 
   10 teeth for 20° full-depth form
 
   12 teeth for 14.5° full-depth form
 
(ii) As shown in Fig. 17.46, the tooth of the 
internal gear corresponds to the tooth space 
of a similar external gear. This results in 
relatively thick and strong tooth. Therefore, 
when the same material is used, the internal 
gear tooth is always stronger than the tooth 
of the external pinion. It is not necessary to 
calculate the beam strength of the internal 
gear tooth. All that is required is to design 
external pinion tooth.
 (iii) As shown in Fig. 17.46, the concave surface 
on the tooth of the internal gear is in contact 
with the convex surface on the tooth of 
the pinion. This increases the contact area 
between two teeth. This is more than the 
Fig. 17.46
 
 contact area between two convex surfaces on 
external gears. Therefore, the limit load in 
wear is more in case of internal gears. There 
is another reason for higher wear strength of 
internal gears. The ratio factor Q for internal 
gears is given by,

It is observed from the above expressions that 
wear strength of the tooth of internal gear is more 
than the tooth of external pinion. It is not necessary 
to calculate the wear strength of internal gear tooth. 
Both from bending and wear considerations, the 
tooth of internal gear is stronger than the tooth of 
external pinion. It is not necessary to design the 
internal gear after the satisfactory design of external 
pinion.

17.24 GEAR LUBRICATION
Proper lubrication of the gear teeth is essential for the 
satisfactory performance and durability of the gears. 
Gears are lubricated by grease, straight mineral oils 
or EP (extreme pressure) lubricants9, 10. Grease is 
used as lubricant for the gears of hand-operated 
mechanisms, where the pitch line velocity is low and 
the operation is intermittent. For medium velocities, 
the gears are enclosed in a box and dipped in a bath 
of mineral oil. This is known as splash lubrication. 
In some cases, gears are lubricated by spraying 
the lubricating oil, in which a jet of oil is directed 
towards the meshing teeth. When the pitch line 
velocities are medium, mineral oils of grades SAE 
8O, SAE 90 or SAE 140 are used. For heavy duty 
applications, EP lubricants are used. EP lubricants 
are mineral oils with additives for the purpose of 
improving the performance of the oil. They are used 
in the automobile gear box and heavy duty industrial 
gearboxes. For splash or spray lubrication, the 
gearbox has additional features, like oil seals for the 
shaft, gaskets for the cover, plug for inserting the 
oil, a drain plug at the bottom and, sometimes, an oil 
level indicator too.

Helical Gears
Chapter 18
18.1 HELICAL GEARS
There is a basic difference between spur and 
helical gears. While the teeth of spur gears are 
cut parallel to the axis of the shaft, the teeth of 
helical gears are cut in the form of a helix on the 
pitch cylinder. In spur gears, the contact between 
meshing teeth occurs along the entire face width 
of the tooth, resulting in sudden application of the 
load, which in turn, results in impact conditions 
and generates noise in high speed applications. In 
helical gears, the contact between meshing teeth 
begins with a point on the leading edge of the 
tooth and gradually extends along the diagonal 
line across the tooth. There is a gradual pick-up of 
load by the tooth, resulting in smooth engagement 
and quiet operation even at high speeds. Helical 
gears are used in automobiles, turbines and high-
speed applications even up to 3000 m/min. There 
are two basic types of helical gears, parallel and 
crossed. Parallel helical gears operate on two 
parallel shafts. In this case, the magnitude of the 
helix angle is the same for the pinion and the gear, 
however, the hand of the helix is opposite. A right-
hand pinion meshes with a left-hand gear and vice 
versa. Crossed helical gears are mounted on shafts 
with crossed axes. Their teeth may have the same 
or opposite hand of the helix. The discussion in this 
chapter is mainly limited to the design of parallel 
helical gears.

TERMINOLOGY OF HELICAL 
GEARS
The conventional representation of a pair of 
helical gears on technical drawings is illustrated in
Fig. 18.1. It is necessary to show the hand of the 
helix or the direction of teeth on the drawing. The 
hand of the helix is indicated by drawing three thin 
continuous lines. The lines are slopping downward 
to the right side of the page for right-handed helical 
teeth. The lines are slopping upward to the right 
side of the page for left-handed helical teeth.

plane. The angle A1B2A2 is the helix angle y. It is 
deﬁ ned as the angle between the axis of the shaft 
and the centre line of the tooth taken on the pitch

The gear rotates from left to right as indicated by 
the arrow. For this rotation, the point A1 will be the 
ﬁ rst point to come in contact with its meshing tooth 
on the other gear. It is called the ‘leading’ edge of 
the tooth. Also, the point A2 will be the last point to 
come in contact with its meshing tooth on the other 
gear. It is called the ‘trailing’ edge of the tooth. 
In order that the contact on the face of the tooth 
shall always contain at least one point, the leading 
edge of the tooth should be advanced ahead of the 
trailing end by a distance greater than the circular 
pitch. Or,

18.5 FORCE ANALYSIS
The resultant force P acting on the tooth of a helical 
gear is resolved into three components, Pt, Pr and 
Pa as shown in Fig. 18.5(a), where
Pt = tangential component (N)
Pr = radial component (N)
Pa = axial or thrust component (N)

where the sufﬁ x p is used for pinion.
The following information is required in order 
to decide the direction of the three components:
 
(i) Which is the driving element? Which is the 
driven element?
 (ii) Is the pinion rotating in clockwise or anti-
clockwise direction?
 (iii) What is the hand of the helix? Is it right 
handed or left handed?
The 
directions 
of 
tangential 
and 
radial 
components are decided by the same method that is 
used for spur gears.
(i) Tangential Component (Pt) 
 (a) The direction of tangential component for a 
driving gear is opposite to the direction of 
rotation. 
 (b) The direction of tangential component for a 
driven gear is same as the direction of rotation. 
(ii) Radial Component (Pr )
 (a) The radial component on the pinion acts 
towards the centre of the pinion.
 (b) The radial component on the gear acts 
towards the centre of the gear.
(iii) 
Thrust 
Component 
(Pa) The 
following 
guidelines can be used to determine the direction of 
the thrust component:
 (a) Select the driving gear from the pair.
Helical Gears 699
 (b) Use right hand for RH-helix and left hand 
for LH-helix.
 (c) Keep the ﬁ ngers in the direction of rotation 
of the gear and the thumb will indicate the 
direction of the thrust component for the 
driving gear.
 (d) The direction of the thrust component for the 
driven gear will be opposite to that for the 
driving gear.
Example 18.2 
A pair of parallel helical gears 
is shown in Fig. 18.6. A 5 kW power at 720 rpm is 
supplied to the pinion A through its shaft. The normal 
module is 5 mm and the normal pressure angle is 
20°. The pinion has right-hand teeth, while the gear 
has left-hand teeth. The helix angle is 30°. The pinion 
rotates in the clockwise direction when seen from 
the left side of the page. Determine the components 
of the tooth force and draw a free-body diagram 
showing the forces acting on the pinion and the gear.

Step II Free-body diagram of forces
The free-body diagram of forces is shown in 
Fig. 18.7. The pinion is the driving element. It is 
rotating in clockwise direction. The direction of 
tangential component for the driving element 
is opposite to that of rotation. Therefore, the 
tangential component on the pinion at the point-1 
will act towards the lower right-hand corner of the 
page. The radial component acts towards the centre 
of respective gear. Therefore, the radial component 
at the point-1 will act in the upward direction. The 
pinion has right-handed teeth. Use the right hand 
and keep the ﬁ ngers in the direction of rotation, i.e., 
in the clockwise direction. The thumb will point 
towards the upper right-hand corner of the page. 
Therefore, the axial component at the point-1 will 
Fig. 18.7
act towards the upper right-hand corner of the page. 
The action and reaction are equal and opposite. 
Therefore, the direction of three components on the 
gear at the point-2 will be opposite to that of the 
pinion.
700 Design of Machine Elements
Example 18.3 The layout of a double-reduction 
helical gearbox is shown in Fig. 18.8. Pinion A is 
the driving gear and 10 kW power at 720 rpm is 
supplied to it through its shaft no. 1. The number of 
teeth on different helical gears are as follows:
zA = 20 zB = 50 zC = 20 zD = 60
Fig. 18.8
The normal pressure angle for all gears is 20°. 
For the pair of helical gears A and B, the helix 
angle is 30°, and the normal module is 3 mm. For 
the pair C and D, the helix angle is 25° and the 
normal module is 5 mm. Pinion A has right-handed 
helical teeth, while the pinion C has left-handed 
helical teeth. The bearings B1 and B2 are mounted 
on shaft no.2 in such a way that bearing B1 can 
take only radial load, while the bearing B2 can take 
both radial as well as thrust load. Determine the 
magnitude and direction of bearing reactions on 
shaft no. 2.
Solution
Given kW = 10 nA = 720 rpm zA = 20
zB = 50 zC = 20  zD = 60 an = 20°
For gears A and B, mn = 3 mm y = 30°
For gears C and D, mn = 5 mm y = 25°

Step III Free-body diagram of forces
The forces acting on the gears C and B and the 
components of the bearing reactions are shown 
in Fig. 18.9. Driving and driven gears are relative 
terms. A is the driving gear, while the gear B is the 
driven gear. C is the driving gear, while D is the 
driven gear. Therefore, on shaft-2, the driving gear 
C and the driven gear B are mounted.
Helical Gears 701
Fig. 18.9
Gear C is the driving element. It is rotating in 
clockwise direction. The direction of tangential 
component for the driving element is opposite to 
that of rotation. Therefore, the tangential component 
on the gear C will act towards the upper left-hand 
corner of the page. The radial component always 
acts towards the centre of the gear. Therefore, the 
radial component on the gear C will act in the 
downward direction at the point of contact. The 
gear C has left-handed teeth. Use the left hand and 
keep ﬁ ngers in the direction of rotation, i.e., in 
clockwise direction. The thumb will point towards 
the lower left-hand corner of the page. Therefore, 
the axial component on the gear C will act towards 
the lower left corner of the paper.
Gear B is the driven element. It is rotating in the 
clockwise direction. The direction of tangential 
component for the driven element is same as that of 
rotation. Therefore, the tangential component on 
the gear B at the point of contact will act towards 
the upper left-hand corner of the page. The radial 
component always acts towards the centre of gear. 
Therefore, the radial component on the gear B will 
act in the upward direction at the point of contact. The 
gear B is the driven gear and the axial component is 
to be decided in relation to the driving gear A. It can 
be shown that the axial component on the gear B acts 
towards the upper right-hand corner of the page.

18.6 BEAM STRENGTH OF HELICAL 
GEARS
In order to determine beam strength, the helical 
gear is considered to be equivalent to a formative 
spur gear, which is discussed in Section 18.3. The 
formative gear is an imaginary spur gear in a plane 
perpen dicular to the tooth element. The pitch circle 
diameter of this gear is d ¢, the number of teeth is 
z ¢ and the module mn. From Eq. (17.16), the beam 
strength of the spur gear is given by,
 
Sb = mbsbY 
(a)
This equation is also applicable to the formative 
spur gear.
Referring to Fig. 18.10,
Fig. 18.10
Sb = (Sb)n = beam strength perpendicular to the 
 
tooth element
m = mn = normal module

In Fig. 18.10, Sb is the component of (Sb)n in the 
plane of rotation. Thus,  
 
Sb = (Sb)n cos y 
(c)
From (b) and (c),
 
Sb = mn b sb Y 
(18.18)
Equation (18.18) is known as Lewis Equation 
for helical gears. In this equation, the form factor 
Y is based on the virtual number of teeth. Equation 
(18.18) gives beam strength in the plane of 
rotation. Therefore, beam strength (Sb) indicates the 
maximum value of tangential force that the tooth 
can transmit without bending failure. It should be 
always more than the effective force between the 
meshing teeth.
18.7 EFFECTIVE LOAD ON GEAR TOOTH
In Section 18.5, a method to determine the 
tangential component of the resultant force between 
two meshing teeth of helical gears is discussed. The 
component is calculated by using the following two 
equations:

The above value of the tangential component, 
therefore, depends upon rated power and rated 
speed. In addition to this, there is the dynamic 
load as discussed in Section 17.19. There are 
two methods to account for the dynamic loadæ 
approximate estimation by means of the velocity 
factor in the preliminary stages of gear design and 
precise calculation by Buckingham’s equation in 
the ﬁ nal stages. 
In the preliminary stages, the effective load Peff

e = sum of errors between two meshing 
 
teeth  (mm)
b = face width of tooth (mm) 
Pt = tangential force due to rated torque (N)
y = helix angle (degrees)
The deformation factor C depends upon the 
modulii of elasticity of materials for pinion and 
gear and the form of tooth or pressure angle. The 
values of C for various conditions are given in 
Table 17.7. Most of the helical gears are made of 
steel with 20° full depth involute system. In this 
case, the deformation factor C is 11400 N/mm2.
The effective load is given by,
 
Peff  = (Cs Pt + Pd) 
(18.22)
where, (Pd) is the dynamic load or additional load due 
to dynamic conditions between two meshing teeth. 
In order to avoid failure of gear tooth due to 
bending,
 
Sb >Peff 
Introducing a factor of safety,
 
Sb = Peff (fs) 
(18.23)
18.8 
WEAR STRENGTH OF HELICAL 
GEARS
The wear strength equation of the spur gear is 
modiﬁ ed to suit helical gears. For this purpose, a 
pair of helical gears is considered to be equivalent 
to a formative pinion and a formative gear in a 
plane perpendicular to the tooth element. From
Eq. (17.33), the wear strength of the spur gear is 
given by,

Equation (18.24) is known as Buckingham’s 
equation of wear strength. Equation (18.24) gives 
wear strength in the plane of rotation. Therefore, 
wear strength (Sw) indicates the maximum 
tangential force that the tooth can transmit without 
pitting failure. It should be always more than the 
effective force between the meshing teeth. The 
virtual number of teeth on the pinion and gear 
are ¢zp and ¢zg respectively. The ratio factor Q for

The above equation is applicable for steel gears 
with 20° normal pressure angle. In order to avoid 
failure of gear tooth due to pitting,
 
Sw > Peff 
Introducing a factor of safety,
 
Sw = Peff (fs) 
(18.29)
Example 18.4 A pair of parallel helical gears 
consists of a 20 teeth pinion meshing with a 100 
teeth gear. The pinion rotates at 720 rpm. The 
normal pressure angle is 20°, while the helix angle 
is 25°. The face width is 40 mm and the normal 
module is 4 mm. The pinion as well as the gear is 
made of steel 4OC8 (Sut = 600 N/mm2) and heat 
treated to a surface hardness of 300 BHN. The 
service factor and the factor of safety are 1.5 and 
2 respectively. Assume that the velocity factor 
accounts for the dynamic load and calculate the 
power transmitting capacity of gears.
Solution
Given np= 720 rpm zp = 20 zg = 100
mn = 4 mm b = 40 mm y = 25° an = 20°
Sut = 600 N/mm2 BHN = 300 Cs = 1.5 (fs) = 2
Since both gears are made of the same material, 
the pinion is weaker than the gear.

Example 18.5 
A pair of parallel helical gears 
consists of 24 teeth pinion rotating at 5000 rpm 
and supplying 2.5 kW power to a gear. The speed 
reduction is 4 : 1. The normal pressure angle and 
Helical Gears 705
helix angle are 20° and 23° respectively. Both gears 
are made of hardened steel (Sut = 750 N/mm2). The 
service factor and the factor of safety are 1.5 and 
2 respectively. The gears are ﬁ nished to meet the 
accuracy of Grade 4.
 
(i)  In the initial stages of gear design, assume 
that the velocity factor accounts for the 
dynamic load and that the face width is 
ten times the normal module. Assuming the 
pitch line velocity to be 10 m/s, estimate the 
normal module.
 (ii)  Select the ﬁ rst preference value of the normal 
module and calculate the main dimensions 
of the gears.
 (iii)  Determine 
the 
dynamic 
load 
using 
Buckingham’s equation and ﬁ nd out the 
effective load for the above dimensions. What 
is the correct factor of safety for bending?
 (iv)  Specify surface hardness for the gears, 
assuming a factor of safety of 2 for wear 
consideration.

18.9 HERRINGBONE GEARS 
When a pair of helical gears transmits power, both 
the input and the output shafts are subjected to a 
thrust load. These thrust forces impose reactions 
on the bearings. This increases the size and cost 
of bearings. The thrust forces on input and output 
shafts can be eliminated by using herringbone 
or double helical gears as shown in Fig. 18.11. 
Both types of gear are constructed by joining two 
identical helical gears of the same module; number 
of teeth and pitch circle diameter, but with teeth 
having opposite hand of helix.
Fig. 18.11 (a) Herringbone Gear (b) Double Helical Gear
There is a basic difference between herringbone 
gear and double helical gear. There is a groove 
between two helical gears in case of double helical 
gear, while a gear without a groove is called 
herringbone gear. Double helical gears are cut on 
a single gear blank, by a hob with a tool run-out 
groove between the hands of helices. Herringbone 
gear is cut by two cutters, which reciprocate 180° 
out of phase to avoid clashing.
Herringbone and double helical gears offer the 
following advantages:
 
(i) They develop opposite thrust reactions and 
thus cancel out the thrust force within the 
gear itself. The net axial force that acts on 
the bearings is zero.
 (ii) The power transmitting capacity is high.
 (iii) High pitch line velocities can be attained 
with herringbone and double helical gears.
The disadvantages of herringbone and double 
helical gears are as follows:
 
(i) Herringbone and double helical gears are 
very expensive compared to helical gears.
Helical Gears 707
 (ii) Balancing of thrust forces depends upon 
the equal distribution of load between the 
right and left part of the gear. Therefore, 
a high degree of precision is required to 
locate herringbone and double helical gears 
axially on the shaft. They must be aligned 
accurately, if each half is to take exactly one 
half of the load. One method of alignment is 
to use thrust bearing for one shaft only and 
allow the other shaft to ﬂ oat axially. In this 
case, the gear tooth forces automatically 
position the other gear so that no external 
forces are present.
Herringbone and double helical gears are used 
in high power applications such as ship drives and 
turbines.
The helix angle for single helical gear is from 
15° to 25°. Herringbone and double helical gears 
permit higher helix angle because there is no 
thrust force. The helix angle for herringbone and 
double helical gears is from 20° to 45°. The design 
procedure and design equations for herringbone 
and double helical gears are the same as for single 
helical gear. In design, a herringbone or double 
helical gear is considered as equal to two identical 
helical gears, each transmitting one half power.
Example 18.6 
A herringbone speed reducer 
consists of a 26 teeth pinion driving a 104 teeth 
gear. The gears have a normal module of 2 mm. 
The pressure angle is 20° and the helix angle is 25°. 
The pinion receives 100 kW power through its shaft 
and rotates at 3600 rpm. The face width of each 
half is 35 mm. The gears are made of alloy steel 
30Ni4Cr1 (Sut = 1500 N/mm2) and heat treated to
a surface hardness of 450 BHN. The service factor 
is 1.25.
Determine the factor of safety against bending 
failure and against pitting failure.
Solution
Given kW = 100 np = 3600 rpm zp = 26
zg = 104 mn = 2 mm b = 35 mm y = 25°
an = 20° Sut = 1500 N/mm2 BHN = 450
Cs = 1.25
Since a herringbone gear consists of two 
identical pairs of helical gears, the power 
transmitted by each pair is (100/2) or 50 kW.

18.10 CROSSED HELICAL GEARS
Helical gears, which are mounted on non-parallel 
shafts, are called crossed helical gears. In these 
gears, the axes of two shafts are neither parallel nor 
intersecting like worm gears. The pitch cylinders 
of a pair of crossed helical gears are illustrated in
Fig. 18.12. The action of crossed helical  gears  differs 
fundamentally from that of parallel helical gears. 
There is a line contact between meshing teeth of 
parallel helical gears. It is observed from the ﬁ gure, 
that kinematically, there is a point contact between 
the meshing teeth of crossed helical gears. Since 
the contact area of a point is very small, the contact 
Fig. 18.12 Pitch Cylinders of Crossed Helical Gears
pressure is high and wear is comparatively rapid. 
Therefore, crossed helical gears have very low 
load carrying capacity. They are not recommended 
for high power transmission. They are particularly 
useful in light duty applications. They are used 
in small internal combustion engines to drive the 
speedometer cable and oil pump and distribution 
system. Their other applications include feed 
mechanisms on machine tools, water pumps and 
instruments.
Figure 18.13(a) shows the contact between 
meshing teeth of crossed helical gears, mounted on 
two shafts—1 and 2. The contact point lies between 
the lower surface of gear-2 and the upper surface 
of gear-1. The gears are rotating in the directions 
shown. At the point of contact,
V1 = pitch line velocity of contact point when 
 
considered on shaft-1.
V2 = pitch line velocity of contact point when
 
considered on shaft-2.
Fig. 18.13 Crossed Helical Gears
It should be noted that the velocity vector V2 
shown in the ﬁ gure is on the lower side of gear-
2. The vectors V1 and V2 act as tangents to their 
respective pitch cylinders at the point of contact. 
The velocity of sliding is the vector difference 
between V1 and V2. The line ab indicates the vector 
Helical Gears 709
difference. Therefore, the velocity of sliding must 
be directed parallel to the line ab at the point of 
contact. Therefore, if the teeth are to be machined 
on these pitch cylinders, the teeth must permit this 
sliding to take place and must be parallel to the line 
ab at the point of contact. Figure 18.13(b) shows 
the orientation of teeth at the point of contact in 
this particular case. The teeth on gear-2 at the point 
of contact are on lower side. Therefore, they are 
shown by dotted lines. It is observed that in this 
case, both gears have teeth with left-hand helix and 
that the angle between the shafts is the sum of the 
helix angles. Therefore,
S = y1 + y2 (for same hand of helix) (18.30)
Similarly, it can be proved that,
S = y1 – y2 (for opposite hand of helix)
(18.31)
where,
y1 = helix angle of gear-1
y2 = helix angle of gear-2
S = shaft angle
When the shaft angle is small, opposite hand 
of helix is used. On the other hand, the same hand 
of helix is used when the shaft angle is more. For 
a particular case, when the shaft angle is 90°, the 
gears must have the same hand of helix and each 
helix angle is 45°. This is the most common case 
of crossed helical gears. There is no difference 
between a crossed helical gear and a parallel helical 
gear until they are mounted in a particular position. 
They are manufactured in the same way. A pair of 
crossed helical gears has the same normal module 
and pressure angle. From Eq. (18.6),

Crossed helical gears are a special category. 
They have limited applications due to poor load 
carrying capacity, considerable amount of sliding 
between meshing teeth and poor efﬁ ciency. There 
are no standards for the proportions of crossed 
helical gears.

19.1 BEVEL GEARS
Bevel gears are used to transmit power between two 
intersecting shafts. There are two common types 
of bevel gears—straight and spiral, as shown in 
Fig. 19.1. The elements of the teeth of the straight 
bevel gears are straight lines, which converge 
into a common apex point. The elements of the 
teeth of the spiral bevel gears are spiral curves, 
Fig. 19.1 
Types of Bevel Gears: (a) Straight Bevel 
Gear (b) Spiral Bevel Gear
which also converge into a common apex point.
Involute proﬁ le is used for the form of the teeth
for both types of gears. Straight bevel gears are 
easy to design and manufacture and give reasonably 
good service when properly mounted on shafts. 
However, they create noise at high-speed conditions. 
Spiral bevel gears, on the other hand, are difﬁ cult to 
design and costly to manufacture, for they require 
specialized and sophisticated machinery for their 
manufacture. Spiral bevel gears have smooth teeth 
engagement, which results in quiet operation, even 
at high speeds. They have better strength and are 
thus used for high speed–high power transmission.
In some cases, bevel gears are classiﬁ ed on the 
basis of pitch angle. Three types of bevel gears that 
are based on pitch angle are as follows: 
 
(i) When the pitch angle is less than 90°, it is 
called external bevel gear.
 (ii) When the pitch angle is equal to 90°, it is 
called crown bevel gear.
 (iii) When the pitch angle is more than 90°, it is 
called internal bevel gear.
There are certain speciﬁ c categories of bevel 
gears. They are as follows: 
(i) Miter Gears When two identical bevel gears 
are mounted on shafts, which are intersecting at 
right angles, they are called ‘miter’ gears. They are 
shown in Fig. 19.2. Miter gears have the following 
characteristics:
Fig. 19.2 Miter Gears
712 Design of Machine Elements
 (a) The pitch angles of pinion and gear of miter 
gears are same and each is equal to 45°.
 (b) The pinion and gear of miter gears rotate at 
the same speed.
 (c) The pinion and gear have same dimensions, 
namely, addendum, dedendum, pitch circle 
diameter, number of teeth and module.
 (d) The pinion and gear of miter gears are 
always mounted on shafts, which are 
perpendicular to each other.
(ii) Crown Gear In a pair of bevel gears, when 
one of the gears has a pitch angle of 90° then 
that gear is called ‘crown’ gear. Such bevel gears 
are mounted on shafts, which are intersecting at 
an angle that is more than 90°. The crown gear is 
equivalent to the rack in spur gearing. The pitch 
cone of the crown gear becomes plane. They are 
shown in Fig. 19.3. Crown gear arrangement has 
the following characteristics:
 (a) The pitch angle of crown gear is 90°.
 (b) The bevel pinion and crown gear are always 
mounted on shafts, which are intersecting at 
angle more than 90°.
Fig. 19.3 Crown Gear
(iii) Internal Bevel Gears When the teeth of bevel 
gear are cut on the inside of the pitch cone, it is 
called internal bevel gear. In this case, the pitch 
angle of internal gear is more than 90° and the apex 
point is on the backside of the teeth on that gear. 
They are shown in Fig. 19.4. Internal bevel gears 
are used in planetary gear trains.
Fig. 19.4 Internal Bevel Gears
(iv) Skew Bevel Gears When two straight bevel 
gears are mounted on shafts, which are non-parallel 
and non-intersecting, they are called ‘skew’ bevel 
gears. They are shown in Fig. 19.5(b). It is seen 
that the apex point of pinion is offset with respect 
to that of gear. Skew bevel gears have following 
characteristics:
 (a) Skew bevel gears have straight teeth.
 (b) Skew bevel gears are mounted on non-
parallel and non-intersecting shafts.
Fig. 19.5 Types of Bevel Gears
(v) Hypoid Gears Hypoid gears are similar to 
spiral bevel gears that are mounted on shafts, 
which are non-parallel and non-intersecting. They 
are shown in Fig. 19.5(d). Hypoid gears are based 
upon pitch surfaces, which are hyperboloids of 
revolution. When two hyperboloids are rotated 
together, the resultant motion is a combination of 
rolling and sliding. The sliding is along the length 
Bevel Gears 713
of teeth and results in increased friction. On this 
account, Extreme Pressure (EP) lubricants are 
used for these gears. Sliding friction reduces the 
efﬁ ciency of hypoid gears. The efﬁ ciency of bevel 
gear drive is 98 to 99 per cent, whereas that of 
hypoid gears is 96 to 98 per cent. Hypoid gears 
have the following characteristics:
 (a) Hypoid gears have curved teeth.
 (b) Hypoid gears are mounted on non-parallel 
and non-intersecting shafts.
Hypoid bevel gears are mainly used in 
automobile differentials. These gears allow the 
drive shaft to be placed well below the centreline 
of the rear axle and thereby lower the centre 
of gravity of the vehicle. Another advantage of
hypoid gears is that the offset of the shaft is
so great that the shafts may continue past each
other. Therefore, multiple power take-offs from
a single shaft with several pinions is possible. Hypoid 
gears give noiseless operation even at high speeds.
(vi) Zerol Gears Zerol gears are spiral bevel gears 
with zero spiral angle. These gears theoretically 
give more gradual contact and a slightly larger 
contact ratio. 
(vii) Face Gears Face gears consist of a spur or 
helical pinion mating with a conjugate gear of disk 
form. They are shown in Fig. 19.5(e). Face gears 
have the following characteristics: 
 (a) The pinion of face gears is either a spur gear 
or a helical gear.
 (b) Face gears are mounted on intersecting 
shafts that are at right angles to each other.
 (c) The teeth of face gears can be straight or 
curved.
Face gears have the following advantages:
 (a) They can be cut with spur gear cutters and 
gear shapers.
 (b) The axial position of the pinion is not critical 
as in case of bevel pinion.
The disadvantage is that the width of the tooth 
face is small.
Bevel gears, straight, spiral or hypoid, are 
not interchangeable and are always designed in 
pairs. In majority of cases, the angle between the
axes of intersecting shafts is 90°. The discussion in 
this chapter is mainly restricted to straight bevel gears, 
connecting two intersecting shafts at right angles.
19.2 TERMINOLOGY OF BEVEL GEARS
A bevel gear is in the form of the frustum of a 
cone. The dimensions of a bevel gear are illustrated 
in Fig. 19.6(a) and (b). The following terms are 
important in terminology of bevel gears:
(i) Pitch Cone Pitch cone is an imaginary cone, 
the surface of which contains the pitch lines of all 
teeth in the bevel gear.
Fig. 19.6 Terminology of Bevel Gear
(ii) Cone Centre The apex of the pitch cone is 
called the cone centre. It is denoted by O.
714 Design of Machine Elements
(iii) Cone Distance Cone distance is the length of 
the pitch-cone element. It is also called pitch-cone 
radius. It is denoted by A0.
(iv) Pitch Angle The angle that the pitch line 
makes with the axis of the gear, is called the pitch 
angle. It is denoted by g. The pitch angle is also 
called centre angle.
(v) Addendum Angle It is the angle subtended by 
the addendum at the cone centre. It is denoted by a.
(vi) Dedendum Angle It is the angle subtended by 
the dedendum at the cone centre. It is denoted by d.
(vii) Face Angle It is the angle subtended by the 
face of the tooth at the cone centre.
Face angle = pitch angle + addendum angle = g + a.
(viii) Root Angle It is the angle subtended by the 
root of the tooth at the cone centre.
Root angle = pitch angle – dedendum angle = g – d.
(ix) Back Cone The back cone is an imaginary 
cone and its elements are perpendicular to the 
elements of the pitch cone.
(x) Back Cone Distance It is the length of the back 
cone element. It is also called back cone radius. It 
is denoted by rb.
It is observed from the ﬁ gure that the cross-
section of the tooth decreases in size as it 
approaches towards the apex point O. Therefore, 
the pitch circle diameter, module, addendum, and 
dedendum decreases and there is no single value 
for these parameters. In practice, these dimensions 
are measured at the largest tooth section called the 
large end of the tooth. The dimensions of the bevel 
gear are always speciﬁ ed and measured at the large 
end of the tooth. The addendum ha, the dedendum 
hf and the pitch circle diameter D are speciﬁ ed at 
the large end of the tooth as shown in Fig. 19.6(b).
The analysis for a bevel gear will show that a true 
section of involutes proﬁ le of tooth lies on the surface 
of a sphere. It is not possible to represent on a plane 
surface, the exact proﬁ le of a bevel gear tooth that 
actually lies on the surface of a sphere. Since the beam 
strength and wear strength equations are based on upon 
tooth proﬁ le, it is necessary to approximate the tooth 
proﬁ le as accurately as possible. The approximation 
is called ‘Tredgold’s approximation’. As shown in
Fig. 19.7(a), a tangent to the sphere at the pitch point 
will closely approximate the surface of the sphere 
for a short distance on either side of the pitch point. 
Therefore, the back cone can be developed as a plane 
surface for constructing a spur gear.
As shown in Fig. 19.7(b), an imaginary spur 
gear is considered in a plane perpendicular to the 
tooth at the large end. rb is the pitch circle radius 
of this imaginary spur gear and z¢ is the number of 
teeth on this gear. The gear is called the formative 
gear and the number of teeth z¢ on this gear is 
called the virtual or the formative number of teeth. 
The formative number of teeth is given by,

19.3 FORCE ANALYSIS
In force analysis, it is assumed that the resultant 
tooth force between two meshing teeth of a pair of 
bevel gears is concentrated at the midpoint along 
the face width of the tooth. This is illustrated in
Fig. 19.9(a), where the resultant force P, shown 
by the dotted line, acts at the midpoint D of the 
face width of the pinion. The resultant force has 
following three components:
Pt = tangential or useful component (N)
Pr = radial component (N)
Pa = axial or thrust component (N)
Consider the plane ABCD shaded by dots in
Fig. 19.9(a) and again shown in Fig. 19.9(b). From 
the triangle BCD,

where,
Ps = separating component (N)
a = pressure angle (degrees)
From (a),
 
Ps = Pt tan a 
(b)
Refer to Fig. 19.9(a). The separating force Ps is 
perpendicular to the pitch line OD. Therefore,
 
AD ^ OD
 Line FD is vertical, while the line OX is 
horizontal. Therefore,
 
FD ^ OX
There are two pairs of perpendicular lines and 
their included angle should be equal. The angle 
between lines OD and OX should be equal to the 
angle between the lines AD and FD. The angle 
716 Design of Machine Elements
between lines OD and OX is the pitch angle g. 
Therefore, the angle between lines AD and FD should 
be equal to the pitch angle g. Consider the plane 
DEAF shown in Fig. 19.9(c). From triangle ADF,
Fig. 19.9 Components of Tooth Face
Pr = Ps cos g
Pa = Ps sin g
Substituting Eq. (b) in the above expressions,
 
Pr = Pt tan a cos g 
(19.7)
 
Pa = Pt tan a sin g 
 (19.8)
The tangential component is determined from 
the following relationship:

m

(19.9)
where,
Mt = torque transmitted by gears (N-mm)
rm = radius of the pinion at midpoint along the 
 
face width (mm)
Equations (19.7), (19.8) and (19.9) are used to 
determine the components of the tooth force on the 
pinion. The components of the tooth force acting 
on the gear can be determined by considering 
actions and reactions as equal and opposite. A two- 
dimensional representation of force components is 
illustrated in Fig. 19.10. As shown in Fig. 19.10(b), 
the mean radius (rm) where the resultant force acts, 
is given by,

the pinion. Similarly, the axial component on the 
gear is equal to the radia1 component (Pr) on the 
pinion.

Fig. 19.10 Force Analysis
In two-dimensional representation of forces, 
very often (∑) and (¥) are used to indicate forces 
perpendicular to the plane of the paper. (∑) 
indicates a force that is perpendicular to the plane 
of paper and which is towards the observer. (¥) 
indicates a force that is perpendicular to the plane 
of the paper and which is away from the observer. 
In examples of bevel gear tooth forces, it is often 
required to ﬁ nd out the magnitude and direction of 
three components acting on the pinion and gear.

The 
directions 
of 
tangential 
and 
radial 
components acting on the pinion and gear are 
decided by same method that is used for spur gears.
(i) Tangential Component (Pt)
 (a) The direction of tangential component for 
the driving gear is opposite to the direction 
of rotation. 
 (b) The direction of tangential component for the 
driven gear is same as the direction of rotation. 
(ii) Radial Component (Pr)
 (a) The radial component on the pinion acts 
towards the centre of the pinion.
 (b) The radial component on the gear acts 
towards the centre of the gear.
(iii) 
Thrust 
Component 
(Pa) The 
following 
guidelines can be used to determine the direction of 
the thrust component:
 (a) The thrust component on the pinion is equal 
and opposite of the radial component on the 
gear.
 (b) The thrust component on the gear is equal and 
opposite of the radial component on the pinion.
The tendency of thrust components is to separate 
the meshing teeth. This fact is useful in deciding 
their directions.

7.5 kW at 300 rpm is shown in Fig. 19.11(a). The 
pressure angle is 20°. Determine the components of 
the resultant gear tooth force and draw a free-body

19.4 BEAM STRENGTH OF BEVEL GEARS
The size of the cross-section of the tooth of a bevel 
gear varies along the face width as shown in Fig. 
19.17. In order to determine the beam strength of the 
tooth of a bevel gear, it is considered to be equivalent 
to a formative spur gear in a plane perpendicular to 
the tooth element. Consider an elemental section 
of the tooth at a distance x from the apex O and 
having a width dx. Applying the Lewis equation to 
a formative spur gear at a distance x from the apex,
 
d (Sb) = mx bxsbY

 is called the bevel factor.
Equation (19.11) is known as the Lewis equation 
for bevel gears. In the above analysis, the beam 
strength (Sb) is determined using the pitch radius R 
at the large end of the tooth (Sb = Mt /R). Therefore, 
the beam strength indicates the maximum value of 
the tangential force at the large end of the tooth 
that the tooth can transmit without bending failure. 
This is not similar to the force analysis in Section 
19.3, where the force components are determined 
at the mean radius rm. It is necessary to compare 
the beam strength with an imaginary force Pt, 
considered to be acting at the large end of the tooth. 
This component is given by,

(19.13)
19.5 WEAR STRENGTH OF BEVEL GEARS
The contact between two meshing teeth of straight 
bevel gears is a line contact, which is similar to that 
of spur gears. In order to determine the wear strength, 
the bevel gear is considered to be equivalent to a 
formative spur gear in a plane which is perpendicular 
to the tooth at the large end. Applying Buckingham’s 
equation to these formative gears,

where,
b = face width of gears (mm)
Q = ratio factor
d¢p= pitch circle diameter of formative

K = material constant (N/mm2)
The pitch circle diameter of the formative pinion 
is given by
 
d¢p = 2rb

In case of bevel gears, either the pinion or the 
gear is generally overhanging. It is subjected to

has been found that to transmit the load, only three-
quarters of the face width is effective. Modifying

The wear strength (Sw) indicates the maximum 
value of the tangential force at the large end of the 
tooth that the tooth can transmit without pitting 
failure. It should be more than the effective force 
between the meshing teeth.
19.6 EFFECTIVE LOAD ON GEAR TOOTH
The tangential component due to power transmission, 
considered to be acting at the large end of the tooth, is 
determined by using the following two equations:

In addition to the tangential component due to 
power transmission, there is the dynamic load. 
There are two methods to account for the dynamic 
load—an approximate estimation by means of the 
velocity factor in the preliminary stages of gear 
design and a precise calculation by Buckingham’s 
equation in the ﬁ nal stages. The effective load Peff 
between two meshing teeth is given by,

Buckingham1. The equation for dynamic load in

e = sum of errors between two meshing

b = face width of tooth (mm) 
Pt = tangential force due to power

Bevel gears are usually made of steel and the 
deformation factor C is 11 400 N/mm2. 
The method used to calculate the error e between 
two meshing teeth in chapters 17 and 18 is limited 
to spur and helical gears. For bevel gears, such 
precise information is difﬁ cult to get. In practice, 
it is necessary to contact the manufacturer and ﬁ nd 
out the expected error between meshing teeth. In 
the absence of such information. Table 19.1 may 
be used to get the values of error e. The classes of 
gears mentioned in the table indicate the following 
manufacturing methods,
Class-1 Well cut commercial gear teeth
Class-2 Gear teeth cut with great care
Class-3 Ground and lapped precision gear teeth
The effective load is given by
 
Peff = Cs Pt + Pd

(19.24)
Equations (19.23) and (19.24) are used to design 
bevel gears.
Example 19.4 A pair of bevel gears, with 20° 
pressure angle, consists of a 20 teeth pinion 
meshing with a 30 teeth gear. The module is 4 mm, 
while the face width is 20 mm. The material for the 
pinion and gear is steel 50C4 (Sut = 750 N/mm2). 
The gear teeth are lapped and ground (Class-3) 
and the surface hardness is 400 BHN. The pinion 
rotates at 500 rpm and receives 2.5 kW power from 
the electric motor. The starting torque of the motor 
is 150% of the rated torque. Determine the factor 
of safety against bending failure and against pitting 
failure.
Solution
Given kW = 2.5 np = 500 rpm zp = 20
zg = 30 m = 4 mm b = 20 mm
Sut = 750 N/mm2 BHN = 400
starting torque = 150% (rated torque)
machining grade = Class-3 a = 20º
Step I Beam strength
Since the same material is used for both pinion and 
gear, the pinion is weaker than the gear.

Example 19.5 A pair of straight bevel gears, 
mounted on shafts which are intersecting at right 
angles, consists of a 24 teeth pinion meshing with 
a 32 teeth gear. The pinion shaft is connected to an 
electric motor developing 12.5 kW rated power at 
1440 rpm. The starting torque of the motor is 150% 
of the rated torque. The pressure angle is 20°. Both 
gears are made of case hardened steel (Sut = 750 
N/mm2). The teeth on gears are generated and 
ﬁ nished by grinding and lapping processes to meet 
the requirements of Class-3 Grade. The factor of 
safety in the preliminary stages of gear design is 2.
 
(i) In the initial stages of gear design, assume 
that velocity factor accounts for the dynamic 
load and that the pitch line velocity is

7.5 m/s. Estimate the module based on beam 
strength.
 (ii)  Select the ﬁ rst preference value of the 
module and calculate the main dimensions 
of the gears.
 (iii)  Determine 
the

using

What is the correct factor of safety for 
bending?
 (iv)  Specify the surface hardness for the gears

Example 19.6 A pair of straight bevel gears is 
mounted on shafts, which are intersecting at right 
angles. The number of teeth on the pinion and gear 
are 21 and 28 respectively. The pressure angle is 
20°. The pinion shaft is connected to an electric 
motor developing 5 kW rated power at 1440 
rpm. The service factor can be taken as 1.5. The 
pinion and the gear are made of steel (Sut = 750 
N/mm2) and heat-treated to a surface hardness of 
380 BHN. The gears are machined by a 
manufacturing process, which limits the error 
between the meshing teeth to 10 mm. The module 
and face width are 4 mm and 20 mm respectively. 
Determine the factor of safety against bending 
as well as against pitting  failure.
Solution
Given kW = 5 np = 1440 rpm zp = 21 zg = 28 
Sut = 750 N/mm2 BHN = 380 m = 4 mm
b = 20 mm Cs = 1.5

19.7 SPIRAL BEVEL GEARS
A pair of spiral bevel gears is illustrated in
Fig. 19.18. In this type of gear, the teeth lie in the 
form of a spiral curve on the pitch cones. The spiral 
angle (y) is measured at the mean radius of the 
gear. In the ﬁ gure, P is a point of the spiral tooth on 
the circle having mean radius. The line XY is drawn 
tangent to the tooth proﬁ le at the point P. The 
inclination of the line XY is the spiral angle (y). 
The salient features of the design of spiral bevel 
gears are as follows:
 
(i) The spiral angle is usually 35°. The pressure 
angle varies from 14.5° to 20°.
 (ii) In order to obtain smooth spiral tooth action, 
the face-contact ratio should be more than 
1.25. The face-contact ratio is a ratio of face 
advance to circular pitch. Both these terms 
are illustrated in the ﬁ gure. 
 (iii) The pinion should have minimum 12 teeth 
in general industrial applications. However, 
spiral bevel gears can be designed with the 
pinion having as few as 6 teeth, provided the 
sum of the number of teeth on the pinion and 
the gear is more than 40.
 (iv) The choice of hand for spiral is important 
in the design. Under certain conditions, the 
induced axial force, with one direction of 
rotation, draws the gears tightly together, 
whereas with opposite direction of rotation, 
Fig. 19.18 Spiral Gear Terminology
728 Design of Machine Elements
the axial force pushes the gears apart. The 
hand of the spiral should be selected in such 
a way so as to cause the gears to separate 
from each other.
 (v) The teeth of the spiral bevel gear are always 
ground.
The comparison between straight and spiral 
bevel gears is similar to the comparison between 
spur and helical gears. Spiral bevel gears offer the 
following advantages over straight bevel gears:
 
(i) There is a gradual contact between mating 
teeth. This results in smooth and quiet 
operation.
 (ii) The spiral bevel gears have more load 
carrying capacity because more teeth are in 
contact simultaneously and there is a greater 
arc of contact.
 (iii) Spiral bevel gears permit higher operational 
speeds.
The spiral bevel gears are used where high 
speeds are encountered.
The analysis of forces in spiral gears is difﬁ cult 
compared with straight tooth bevel gears because a 
number of parameters are involved such as hand of 
spiral for pinion as well as for gear and direction of 
rotation for pinion.

Worm Gears
Chapter 20
20.1 WORM GEARS
Worm gear drives are used to transmit power between 
two non-intersecting shafts, which are, in general, 
at right angles to each other. The worm gear drive 
consists of a worm and a worm wheel. The worm is 
a threaded screw, while the worm wheel is a toothed 
gear. The teeth on the worm wheel envelope the 
threads on the worm and give line contact between 
mating parts. The ad vantages of worm gear drives 
are as follows:
 
(i) The most important characteristic of worm 
gear drives is their high speed reduction. A 
speed reduction as high as 100 : 1 can be 
obtained with a single pair of worm gears.
 
(ii) The worm gear drives are compact with 
small overall dimensions, compared with 
equivalent spur or helical gear drives having 
same speed reduction.
 (iii) The operation is smooth and silent.
 (iv) Provision can be made for self locking 
operation, where the motion is transmitted 
only from the worm to the worm wheel. This 
is advantageous in applications like cranes 
and lifting devices.
The drawbacks of the worm gear drives are as 
follows:
 
(i) The efﬁ ciency is low compared with other 
types of gear drives.
 
(ii) The worm wheel, in general, is made of 
phosphor bronze, which increases the cost.
 (iii) Considerable amount of heat is generated in 
worm gear drives, which is required to be 
dissipated by a lubricating oil to the housing 
walls and ﬁ nally to the surroundings.
 (iv) The power transmitting capacity is low. 
Worm gear drives are used for up to 100 kW 
of power transmission.
It is necessary to consider the relationship 
between the number of starts on the worm and the 
efﬁ ciency to decide the suitability of worm gear 
drive for a particular application. Two guidelines 
are as follows:
 
(i) Single-threaded worm gives large speed 
reduction, however, the efﬁ ciency is low. 
The large velocity ratio is obtained at the 
cost of efﬁ ciency.
 
(ii) Multi-threaded worm gives high efﬁ ciency, 
however, the speed reduction is low. The 
high efﬁ ciency is obtained at the cost of 
speed reduction.
The above guidelines lead to four major areas 
of application of worm gear drives. They are as 
follows:
(i) Manually Operated Intermittent Mechanisms In 
these applications, large mechanical advantage 
is required and efﬁ ciency is of minor importance. 
The examples of these mechanisms include steering 
mechanism and opening and closing of gate valves 
by means of hand wheels. 
Worm Gears 731
(ii) Motorized Operated Intermittent Mechanisms  
In these applications, a small capacity low-cost 
motor drives the mechanism and the efﬁ ciency 
is of minor importance. The examples of these 
mechanisms include drive for small hoists and 
opening and closing of large gate valves by means 
of electric motor. 
(iii) Motorized Continuous Operations In these 
applications, worm gear drives are used in place of 
other gear drives due to space limitations and silent 
operation. The efﬁ ciency is more important in these 
applications. Multi-threaded worms are used in 
these applications to obtain higher efﬁ ciency. The 
examples of this type include drives for machine 
tools and elevators. 
(iv) Motorized Speed Increasing Applications In 
these applications, worm gear drives are preferred 
due to high velocity ratio and silent operation. The 
efﬁ ciency is more important in these applications. 
Speed increasing applications include drives 
for automotive supercharger and centrifugal 
cream charger. In order to increase efﬁ ciency, the 
automotive supercharger is provided with six-
threaded worm having lead angle of about 45°.
20.2 TERMINOLOGY OF WORM GEARS
A pair of worm gears is speciﬁ ed and designated by 
four quantities in the following manner:
 
z1/z2/q/m
where,
 
z1 = number of starts on the worm
 
z2 = number of teeth on the worm wheel
 
q = diametral quotient
 
 m = module (mm)
The diametral quotient is given by,
 
q
d
m
=
1  
 (20.1)
where d1 is the pitch circle diameter of the worm. 
A schematic diagram of the worm and worm 
wheel is shown in Fig. 20.1(a). d1 and d2 are pitch 
circle diameters of the worm and the worm wheel 
respectively. The worm is similar to a screw with 
single-start or multi-start threads. The threads of the 
worm have an involute helicoid proﬁ le. The following 
terms are used in terminology of worm gear drives:
Fig. 20.1 Worm Gear Terminology
(i) Axial Pitch The axial pitch (px) of the worm is 
deﬁ ned as the distance measured from a point on one 
thread to the corresponding point on the adjacent 
thread, measured along the axis of the worm. 
(ii) Lead The lead (l) of the worm is deﬁ ned as the 
distance that a point on the helical proﬁ le will move 
when the worm is rotated through one revolution. 
It is the thread advance in one turn. For single-start 
threads, the lead is equal to the axial pitch. For 
double-start threads, the lead is twice the axial pitch, 
and so on. Therefore,
 
 l = px z1 
 (20.2)
The recommended number of starts on the worm 
is as follows:
Velocity ratio
Number of starts
20 and above
Single-start
12–36
Double-start
  8–12
Triple-start
  6–12
Quadruple-start

732 Design of Machine Elements
The pitch circle diameter of the worm wheel is 
given by
 
 d2 = mz2 
 (20.3)
As seen in the ﬁ gure, the axial pitch of the worm 
should be equal to the circular pitch of the worm 
wheel. Therefore,

From Eqs (20.2) and (20.4),

 (20.5)
When one thread of the worm is developed, it 
becomes the hypotenuse of a triangle as shown in 
Fig. 20.1(b). The base of this triangle is equal to the 
lead of the worm, while the altitude is equal to the 
circumference of the worm. There are two angles 
related to this triangle, namely, lead angle and helix 
angle.
(iii) Lead Angle The lead angle (g) is deﬁ ned as the 
angle between a tangent to the thread at the pitch 
diameter and a plane normal to the worm axis. From 
the triangle in Fig. 20.1(b),

the angle between a tangent to the thread at the pitch 
diameter and the axis of the worm. The worm helix 
angle is the complement of the worm lead angle.
 
g
y
p
+

The helix angle should be limited to 6° per thread. 
For example, if y = 30° then the worm should have 
at least ﬁ ve threads.
(v) Pressure Angle The tooth pressure angle (a) is 
measured in a plane containing the axis of the worm 
and it is equal to one-half of the thread angle. It is 
illustrated in Fig. 20.1(c). The pressure angle should 
not be less than 20° for single and double start 
worms and 25° for triple and multi-start worms.

 (20.9)
When the worm wheel is rotated through one 
revolution, the worm will complete z2 revolutions 
for single-start threads. For double-start threads, the 
number of revolutions of the worm will be (z2 /2). 
The speed ratio (i) is, therefore, given by,

There are two classes of worm gear drives in 
common use, namely, single enveloping and double 
enveloping, as shown in Fig. 20.1(c) and (d).
(i) Single-enveloping Worm Gear Drive A single-
enveloping worm gear set is one in which the gear 
wraps around or partially encloses the worm. This 
results in line contact between the threads of the 
worm and the teeth of the worm wheel. In this case, 
the worm is also called ‘cylindrical’ or ‘straight’ 
cylindrical worm. The single-enveloping worm gear 
drive is more widely used.
(i) Double-enveloping Worm Gear Drive A  double-
enveloping gear set is one in which the gear wraps 
around the worm and the worm also wraps around the 
gear. This results in area contact between the threads 
of the worm and the teeth of the worm wheel. In this 
case, the worm is also called ‘hourglass’ worm. This 
drive is also called ‘cone’ gearing.
Double-enveloping worm gear drive has the 
following advantages:
 
(i) The contact pressure between the threads of 
the worm and the teeth of the worm wheel is 
low. This reduces wear.
 
(ii) The drive occupies less space for a given 
capacity. Double-enveloping worm gear 
Worm Gears 733
drive needs only about two-thirds of the 
space and has about one-third of the weight 
compared with a single-enveloping worm 
gear drive.
The main drawback of double-enveloping worm 
gear drive is the requirement of precise alignment. 
It is much more critical than in case of single-
enveloping worm gear drive. A small deviation 
from the correct centre distance results in the loss of 
theoretical area of contact.
The preferred values of z1/z2/q/m for worm gears1 
are given in Table 20.1. While designing the worm 
gears, it is better to use the following values of q,
Preferred values of q 8, 10, 12.5, 16, 20 and 25.
The number of starts (z1) on the worm is usually 
taken as 1, 2 or 4.

20.3 PROPORTIONS OF WORM GEARS
The basic dimensions of the worm and the worm 
wheel are shown in Fig. 20.2. For an involute 
helicoidal tooth form,
 
ha1 = m 
 (20.11)
 
hf1 = (2.2 cos g –1)m 
 (20.12)
 
c = 0.2 m cos g 
 (20.13)
where, 
 
ha1 = addendum (mm)
 
hf1 = dedendum (mm)
 
c = clearance (mm)
The outside and root diameters of the worm are 
expressed as follows: 
 
da1 = d1 + 2ha1 = qm + 2m
\ 
da1 = m(q + 2) 
(20.14)
 
 df1 = d1 – 2hf1 = qm – 2m (2.2 cos g – 1) 
\ 
df1 = m(q + 2 – 4.4 cos g ) 
(20.15)
where 
 
da1 = outside diameter of the worm (mm)
 
df1 = root diameter of the worm (mm)
Similarly, the dimensions of the worm wheel can 
be expressed. The addendum and dedendum of the 
worm wheel are expressed at the throat. They are 
given by,
Fig. 20.2 Dimension of Worm Gears
 1 IS 3734–1966: Dimensions of worm gearing.
734 Design of Machine Elements
 
ha2 = m (2 cos g  – 1) 
 (20.16)
 
hf2 = m (1 + 0.2 cos g) 
(20.17)
where,
 
ha2 = addendum at the throat (mm)
 
hf2 = dedendum in the median plane (mm)
The dimensions of the worm wheel are as 
follows:
 
da2 = d2 + 2ha2 = mz2 + 2m(2 cos g  – 1) 
\ 
da2 = m (z2 + 4cos g  – 2) 
(20.18)
 
df 2 = d2 + 2hf 2 = mz2 – 2m(1 + 0.2 cos g) 
\ 
df 2 = m(z2 – 2 – 0.4 cos g) 
(20.19)
where,
 da2 = throat diameter of the worm wheel (mm)
 df2 = root diameter of the worm wheel (mm)
The effective face width F of the worm wheel 
is shown in Fig. 20.3. It is obtained by drawing a 
tangent AB to the pitch circle diameter of the worm. 
A and B are the points of intersection of this tangent 
and the outside diameter of the worm.

20.4 FORCE ANALYSIS
The analysis of three components of the resultant 
tooth force between the meshing teeth of worm and 
worm wheel is based on the following assumptions:
 
(i) The worm is the driving element, while the 
worm wheel is the driven element.
 
(ii) The worm has right-handed threads.
 (iii) The worm rotates in anti-clockwise directions 
as shown in Fig. 20.4.
The three components of the gear tooth force 
between the worm and the worm wheel are shown 
in Fig. 20.4. Sufﬁ x 1 is used for the worm, while
Fig. 20.4 Components of Tooth Force
sufﬁ x 2 for the worm wheel. The components of the 
resultant force acting on the worm are as follows:
 (P1)t = tangential component on the worm (N)
 (P1)a = axial component on the worm (N)
 (P1)r = radial component on the worm (N)
The components (P2)t, (P2)a and (P2)r acting on 
the worm wheel are deﬁ ned in a similar way. The 
force acting on the worm wheel is the equal and 
opposite reaction of the force acting on the worm.
Therefore,
 
(P2)t = (P1)a 
(20.22)
 
(P2)a = (P1)t 
(20.23)
 
(P2)r = (P1)r 
(20.24)
In the present analysis, the expressions are 
derived for the components of force acting on the 
worm. The components of force acting on the worm 
wheel can be determined by the above relationship.
It is difﬁ cult to understand the directions of 
components with the help of two views shown in 
Fig. 20.4. It is better to construct an isometric sketch 
of the worm and worm wheel for understanding 
the directions. The directions can be decided with 
the help of such isometric sketches illustrated in
Fig. 20.5.
Fig. 20.5 Direction of Force Components
(i) Tangential Component (P1)t The worm is the 
driving element. It is rotating in an anti-clockwise 
direction, when viewed from A. For the driving element, 
the direction of tangential component is opposite to the 
direction of rotation. Therefore, (P1)t will act in the 
positive X direction at the point of contact.
736 Design of Machine Elements
(ii) Axial Component (P1)a The worm has right-
hand threads and when the right-hand thumb rule 
is applied, by keeping the ﬁ ngers in the direction 
of rotation, the thumb will be projecting along the 
positive Y-axis. Therefore, if we treat the worm as 
‘screw’ and the worm wheel as ‘nut’, the screw 
will have a tendency to move in the direction of the 
thumb or along the positive Y-axis. The nut or the 
worm wheel will have a tendency to move in the 
opposite direction, i.e., along the negative Y-axis. 
Therefore, the worm wheel will rotate in the anti-
clockwise direction when observed from the bearing 
B. The worm wheel is the driven member and the 
direction of (P2)t will be the same as the direction 
of rotation or along the negative Y-axis. Since, (P1)a 
and (P2)t are equal and opposite, the axial component 
(P1)a will act in the positive Y direction at the point 
of contact.
(iii) Radial Component (P1)r The radial component 
always acts towards the centre of gear. Therefore, 
(P1)r will act towards the centre of the worm or along 
the negative Z-direction at the point of contact.
The resultant force acting on the worm consists 
of two components—components of normal 
reaction between the meshing teeth and components 
of frictional force. The two components are 
superimposed to get the resultant components. 
The components of the normal reaction P acting 
on the worm are shown in Fig. 20.6. Here, a is the 
normal pressure angle, while g is the lead angle. 
Note that the angle a is in the plane ABCD shaded 
by dots, while the angle g is in the top plane AEBF. 
Resolving the normal reaction P in the plane ABCD 
shown in Fig. 20.6(b),
 
 PN = P cos a 
(a)
 
 Pr = P sin a 
(b)
Resolving the component PN in the plane AEBF 
shown in Fig. 20.6(c),
 
 Pa = PN cos g 
(c)
 
 Pt = PN sin g 
(d)
From relationships (a), (b), (c) and (d),
 
 Pt = P cos a sin g 
 
Pa = P cos a cos g 
 
Pr = P sin a 
(20.25)
Fig. 20.6 Components of Normal Reaction
The frictional force is signiﬁ cant in worm gear 
drives, because there is sliding motion between the 
threads of the worm and the teeth of the worm wheel, 
as compared with the rolling motion between the 
teeth of the pinion and gear in other types of gears. 
The resultant frictional force is (mP) where m is the 
coefﬁ cient of friction. The direction of the frictional 
force will be along the pitch helix and opposite to 
the direction of rotation, as shown in Fig. 20.7. 
There are two components of the frictional force:
Fig. 20.7 Components of Frictional Force
Worm Gears 737
 
 (i) Component (mP cos g) in the tangential 
direction. The direction of this component is 
same as that of Pt.
 
 (ii) Component (mP sin g ) in the axial direction. 
The direction of this component is opposite 
to that of Pa.
Superimposing the components of normal 
reaction and frictional force, we have
 
 (P1) t = P cos a sin g  + mP cos g 
\ 
(P1) t = P (cos a sin g  + m cos g) (20.26)
Similarly,  (P1) a = P cos a cos g  – mP sin g 
\ 
 (P1)a = P (cos a cos g  – m sin g) (20.27)
and 
(P1)r = P sin a 
 (20.28)
In practice, the tangential component (P1)t on 
the worm is determined from the torque that is 
transmitted from the worm to the worm wheel.

20.5 FRICTION IN WORM GEARS
It has been observed that the coefﬁ cient of friction in 
worm gear drives depends upon the rubbing speed. 
The rubbing speed is the relative velocity between 
the worm and the wheel. The velocity triangle is 
shown in Fig. 20.8.
   In this velocity triangle,
V1 = pitch line ve1ocity of the worm (m/s)
V2 = pitch line velocity of the worm wheel (m/s) 
Vs = rubbing velocity (m/s)

The variation of the coefﬁ cient of friction with

The values of the coefﬁ cient of friction in this ﬁ gure 
are based on the following two assumptions:
 
 (i) The worm wheel is made of phosphor-
bronze, while the worm is made of case-
hardened steel.

The efﬁ ciency of spur or helical gears is very 
high and virtually constant in the range of 98% to 
99%. On the other hand, the efﬁ ciency of worm 
gears is low and varies considerably in the range of 
50% to 98%. In general, the efﬁ ciency is inversely 
proportional to speed ratio, provided the coefﬁ cient 
of friction is constant.
 In general, the worm is the driver and the worm 
wheel is the driven member and the reverse motion 
is not possible. This is called ‘self-locking’ drive, 
because the worm wheel cannot drive the worm. As 
for screw threads, the criterion for self-locking is 
the relationship between the coefﬁ cient of friction 
and lead angle. A worm gear drive is said to be self-
locking if the coefﬁ cient of friction is greater than 
tangent of lead angle, i.e., the friction angle is more 
than the lead angle. This approximate condition is 
rewritten as,
 
 m > tan g 
There is another term, ‘reversible’ or ‘overrunning’ 
or ‘back-driving’ worm gear drive. In this type of 
drive, the worm and worm wheel can drive each 
other. In general, the worm is the driver and the 
worm wheel is the driven member. If the driven 
machinery has large inertia and if the driving power 
supply is cut off suddenly, the worm is freely driven 
by the worm wheel. This prevents the damage to 
the drive and source of power. A worm-gear drive 
is said to be reversible if the coefﬁ cient of friction 
is less than tangent of lead angle, i.e., the friction 
angle is less than the lead angle. This approximate 
condition is rewritten as,
 
 m < tan g 
Example 20.3 
1 kW power at 720 rpm is supplied 
to the worm shaft. The number of starts for threads 
of the worm is four with a 50 mm pitch–circle 
diameter. The worm wheel has 30 teeth with 5 mm 
module. The normal pressure angle is 20°. Calculate 
the efﬁ ciency of the worm gear drive and the power 
lost in friction.

angle is 20°. The worm wheel is mounted between 
two bearings A and B. It can be assumed that the 
bearing A is located at the origin of the co-ordinate 
system and the bearing B takes complete thrust load. 
Determine the reactions at the two bearings.

Step II Components of tooth force acting on worm 
wheel
The force components acting on the worm wheel are 
as follows (Eqs 20.22 to 20.24):
 
(P2)t = (P1)a = 11097 N
 
(P2)a = (P1)t = 2653 N
 
(P2)r = (P1)r  = 4150 N
The directions of the three components is decided 
with reference to Fig. 20.11.
Fig. 20.11
(i) Tangential Component (P2)t The worm has 
right-hand threads and when the right-hand thumb 
rule is applied by keeping the ﬁ ngers in the direction 
of rotation, the thumb will be projecting along the 
positive Y-axis. Therefore, if we treat the worm as 
a ‘screw’ and the worm wheel as ‘nut’, the screw 
will have a tendency to move in the direction of 
the thumb or along the positive Y-axis. The nut or 
the worm wheel will have a tendency to move in 
the opposite direction, i.e., along the negative Y-
axis. Therefore, the worm wheel will rotate in the 
clockwise direction when observed from the bearing 
B. The worm wheel is the driven member and the 
direction of (P2)t will be the same as the direction of 
rotation or along the negative Y-axis.
(ii) Axial Component (P2)a The worm is the driving 
element. It is rotating in an anti-clockwise direction 
as shown in the ﬁ gure. The direction of tangential 
component for the driving element is opposite to the 
direction of rotation. Therefore, (P1)t will act in the 
negative X-direction. Since (P1)t and (P2)a are equal 
and opposite, the direction of (P2)a will be along the 
positive X-direction.
Worm Gears 741
(iii) Radial Component (P2)r The radial component 
always acts towards the centre of gear. Therefore, 
(P2)r will act towards the centre of worm wheel or 
along negative Z-direction.
Step III Reactions at two bearings
The forces acting on the worm wheel shaft are 
shown in Fig. 20.12. For the sake of convenience, 
we will call the XZ plane as the vertical plane and 
the XY plane as the horizontal plane. The forces 
in the vertical and horizontal planes are shown in
Fig. 20.13. 
Fig. 20.12
Fig. 20.13
Taking moment of forces in the vertical plane 
about the bearing A,
 
4150 ¥ 60 + 2653 ¥ 100 = (RB)v ¥ 120
 
(RB)v = 4285.83 N
Considering equilibrium of vertical forces,
 
(RA)v + 4150 = 4285.83
 
 (RA)v = 135.83 N
Considering forces in the horizontal plane,
  
(RA)h = (RB)h = 11097/2 = 5548.5 N
Considering equilibrium of axial forces,
 
(RB)a = 2653 N
20.6 SELECTION OF MATERIALS
The selection of materials for the worm and the 
worm wheel is more limited than it is for other types 
of gears. The threads of the worm are subjected to 
ﬂ uctuating stresses and the number of stress cycles 
is fairly large. Therefore, the surface endurance 
strength is an important criterion in the selection of 
the worm material. The core of the worm should be 
kept ductile and tough to ensure maximum energy 
absorption. The worms are, therefore, made of case 
hardened steel with a surface hardness of 60 HRC 
and a case depth of 0.75 to 4.5 mm. The following 
varieties of steel are used for the worm:
 Normalized carbon steels—40C8, 55C8
Case-hardened carbon steels—10C4, 14C6
Case-hardened alloy steels–16Ni80Cr60,   
 
20Ni2Mo25
Nickel–chromium steels—13Ni3Cr80,  
 
 
15Ni4Cr1
The magnitude of contact stresses on the worm 
wheel teeth is the same as that on the worm threads. 
However, the number of stress cycles is reduced 
by a factor equal to the speed reduction. The worm 
wheel cannot be accurately generated in the hobbing 
process. The ﬁ nal proﬁ le and ﬁ nish of the worm wheel 
teeth is the result of plastic deformation during the 
initial stages of service. Therefore, the worm wheel 
material should be soft and conformable. Phosphor-
bronze, with a surface hardness of 90–120 BHN, is 
widely used for the worm wheel. Phosphor-bronze 
worm wheels are sand-cast, sand-cast and chilled, 
or centrifugally cast. Phosphor-bronze is costly and 
in case of worm wheels with large dimensions, only 
742 Design of Machine Elements
the outer rim is made of phosphor-bronze. It is then 
bolted to the cast iron wheel. There are two reasons 
for using ‘dissimilar’ or ‘heterogeneous’ materials 
for worms and worm wheels:
 
(i) The coefﬁ cient of friction is reduced.
 
(ii) The conformability of worm wheel with 
respect to the worm is improved.
In spur, helical or bevel gears, the same material 
can be used for pinion and gear. In worm gear drive, 
however, dissimilar materials are used for the worm 
and worm wheel.
20.7 STRENGTH RATING OF WORM 
GEARS
Since the teeth of worm wheel are weaker than the 
threads of worm, the design for strength can be 
based on Lewis’ equation as applied to worm wheel 
teeth. In this case, it is not necessary to design the 
worm on the basis of strength. 
The worm gears are usually designed according 
to national and international codes. There are two 
basic equations: beam strength and wear strength 
equations. The maximum permissible torque that the 
worm wheel can withstand without bending failure 
is given by the lower of the following two values2 :
 
(Mt)1 = 17.65 Xb1Sb1m1r d2 cos g 
(20.35)
 
(Mt)2 = 17.65 Xb2Sb2m1r d2 cos g 
(20.36)
where,
(Mt)1, (Mt)2 = permissible torque on the worm  
 
wheel (N-mm)
Xb1, Xb2 = speed factors for strength of worm
 
and  worm wheel
Sb1, Sb2 = bending stress factors of worm and  
 
worm wheel
m = module (mm)
lr = length of the root of worm wheel teeth (mm) 
 
[Eq. (20.21)]
d2 = pitch circle diameter of worm wheel (mm)
g  = lead angle of the worm
The bending stress factor (Sb) for various 
materials is given in Table 20.2. The speed factor 
for strength (Xb) of worm gears is obtained from 
2 IS 7443–1974: Method for load rating of worm gears

on beam strength is given by,

by the lower of the following two values:
 
 (Mt)3 = 18.64 Xc1 Sc1 Yz (d2)1.8 m 
(20.38)
 
 (Mt)4 = 18.64 Xc2 Sc2 Yz (d2)1.8 m

the various materials are given in Table 20.3. The 
values of the worm gear zone factor are given in

20.9 THERMAL CONSIDERATIONS
The efﬁ ciency of a worm gear drive is low and the 
work done by friction is converted into heat. When 
the worm gears operate continuously, considerable 
amount of heat is generated. The rate of heat 
generated (Hg ) is given by,
 
Hg = 1000 (1 – h) kW 
(a)
where,
 
Hg = rate of heat generation (W) 
 
h = efﬁ ciency of worm gears (fraction)
 
kW = power transmitted by gears (kW)
The heat is dissipated through the lubricating oil to 
the housing wall and ﬁ nally to the surrounding air. 
The rate of heat dissipated (Hd) by the housing walls 
to the surrounding air is given by,
 
Hd = k (t – to)A 
(b)
where,
Hd = the rate of heat dissipation (W)
k = overall heat transfer coefﬁ cient of housing  
 
walls (W/m2 °C)
t = temperature of the lubricating oil (°C)
to = temperature of the surrounding air (°C)
A = effective surface area of housing (m2 )
Equating (a) and (b),
 
1000(1 – h) kW = k(t – to) A
The above equation is written in the following 
two ways:

(20.41)
Equation (20.40) gives the power transmitting 
capacity based on thermal considera tions. Equation 
(20.41) gives the resultant temperature of the 
lubricating oil for a given power transmitting 
capacity.
The overall heat transfer coefﬁ cient under normal 
working conditions with natural air circulation is 12 
to 18 W/m2 °C. This value can be further increased 
by providing a fan on the worm shaft and arranging 
the ﬁ ns horizontally along the stream of air. In 
such cases, the value of the overall heat transfer 
coefﬁ cient can be taken as 20 to 28 W/m2 °C. It 
has been observed that the maximum permissible 
746 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 20.15 Speed Factor for Worm Gears for Wear (Xc)
Worm Gears 747
temperature for commonly used lubricating oils is 
95°C, above which it loses its properties and there is 
a danger of gear tooth failure due to seizure. 
Example 20.7 
A worm gear box with an effective 
surface area of 1.5 m2 is operating in still air 
with a heat transfer coefﬁ cient of 15 W/m2°C. The 
temperature rise of the lubricating oil above the 
atmospheric temperature is limited to 50°C. The 
worm gears are designated as,
1/30/10/8
The worm shaft is rotating at 1440 rpm and 
the normal pressure angle is 20°. Calculate the 
power transmitting capacity based on the thermal 
considerations.

Chapter 21
21.1 FLYWHEEL
A ﬂ ywheel is a heavy rotating body that acts as a 
reservoir of energy. The energy is stored in the 
ﬂ ywheel in the form of kinetic energy. The ﬂ ywheel 
acts as an energy bank between the source of power 
and the driven machinery. Depending upon the 
source of power and type of driven machinery, there 
are two distinct applications of the ﬂ ywheel.
In certain cases, the power is supplied at uniform 
rate, while the demand for power from the driven 
machinery is variable, e.g., a punch press driven by an 
electric motor. In punching and shearing machines, 
maximum power is required only during a small 
part of the cycle, when actual punching or shearing 
takes place. During the remaining part of the cycle, 
negligible power is required to overcome friction. 
If these machines are directly driven by an electric 
motor, a higher capacity motor corresponding to 
maximum power requirement during actual punching 
or shearing will be required. Such a motor will run 
almost idle during the remaining part of the cycle. It 
is obviously wasteful to provide such a large motor 
when its full capacity is needed but a small fraction 
of the time. Providing a ﬂ ywheel to these machines 
allow a much smaller motor to be used. During the 
actual punching or shearing operations, energy will 
be taken from the ﬂ ywheel, slowing it down. During 
the relatively long period between two punching or 
shearing operations, the motor will accelerate the 
ﬂ ywheel back to its original speed. Thus, the ﬂ ywheel 
stores the kinetic energy during the idle portion of 
the work cycle by increasing its speed and delivers 
this kinetic energy during the peak-load period of 
punching or shearing. Therefore, when a ﬂ ywheel 
is used between the motor and these machines, a 
smaller capacity motor is sufﬁ cient. 
In other applications, the power is supplied at 
variable rate, while the requirement of the driven 
machinery is at a uniform rate, e.g., machinery 
driven by an internal combustion engine. In IC 
engines, the power is generated at a variable rate. 
The ﬂ ywheel absorbs the excess energy during 
the expansion stroke, when power developed in 
the cylinder exceeds the demand. This energy is 
delivered during suction, compression and exhaust 
strokes. The ﬂ ywheel, therefore, enables the engine 
to supply the power at a practically uniform rate.
The functions of the ﬂ ywheel are as follows:
 
(i) To store and release energy when needed 
during the work cycle
 
(ii) To reduce the power capacity of the electric 
motor or engine
 (iii) To 
reduce 
the 
amplitude 
of 
speed 
ﬂ uctuations
The construction of a solid one-piece ﬂ ywheel 
made of grey cast iron is shown in Fig. 21.1. The 
arms have an elliptical cross-section. In small 
ﬂ ywheels, the arms are replaced by a solid web. 
In large ﬂ ywheels, stresses are induced in the 
750 Design of Machine Elements
arms during the casting process. There is a heavy 
concentration of mass at the rim and at the hub, 
which results in unequal cooling rates for the 
rim, the hub and the arms. The resulting stresses, 
called cooling stresses, are sometimes of such a 
magnitude as to cause the breakage of arms. Such 
cooling stresses can be avoided by using a split-
type construction as illustrated in Fig. 21.2. In this 
case, the rim and the hub are cut through the centre. 
The arms are, therefore, free to contract during the 
cooling process in the mould and residual cooling 
stresses are avoided.

Fig. 21.2 Split Flywheel 
21.2 FLYWHEEL AND GOVERNOR
Both ﬂ ywheel and governor, are used in internal 
combustion engines to control the speed. The 
function of the engine governor is to control the 
mean speed of the engine. If the mean speed varies 
due to variation of load, the governor adjusts the 
fuel supply to the engine and restores the speed 
to its former value. If the load on the engine shaft 
increases, the speed of the engine decreases and the 
supply of fuel is increased by increasing the opening 
of the throttle valve. This increases the engine speed 
to its former value. On the other hand, if the load 
on the engine shaft decreases, the speed of the 
engine increases and the supply of fuel is decreased 
by reducing the opening of the throttle valve. This 
decreases the engine speed to its former value. The 
governor adjusts the opening of the throttle valve 
through a suitable mechanism. In petrol engine, the 
governor adjusts the opening of the throttle valve. 
In diesel engine, the governor adjusts the opening 
of the fuel pump.
There is a basic difference between the functions 
of ﬂ ywheel and governor. It is as follows:
 
(i) The ﬂ ywheel limits the inevitable ﬂ uctuations 
of speed during ‘each cycle’, which arise 
from ﬂ uctuations of turning moment on 
the crankshaft. The governor controls the 
‘mean’ speed of the engine by varying the 
fuel supply to the engine.
 
(ii) The ﬂ ywheel has no inﬂ uence on the ‘mean’ 
speed of the engine. It does not maintain 
a constant speed. The governor has no 
inﬂ uence on ‘cyclic’ speed ﬂ uctuations.
 (iii) If the load on the engine is constant, the 
mean speed will be constant from cycle to 
cycle and the governor will not operate. 
On the other hand, the ﬂ ywheel will be 
always acting. The operation of ﬂ ywheel is 
continuous while that of governor is more or 
less intermittent.
 (iv) A ﬂ ywheel may not be used if the cyclic 
ﬂ uctuations of energy output are small or 
negligible. A governor is essential for all 
types of engines to adjust the fuel supply as 
per the demand.
 
(v) The kind of energy stored in ﬂ ywheel is 
kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is all 
available, 100% convertible into work 
without friction. The governor mechanism 
involves frictional losses.
21.3 FLYWHEEL MATERIALS
Traditionally, ﬂ ywheels are made of cast iron. From 
design considerations, cast iron ﬂ ywheels offer the 
following advantages:
 
(i) Cast iron ﬂ ywheels are the cheapest.
 
(ii) Cast iron ﬂ ywheel can be given any 
complex shape without involving machining 
operations.
Flywheel 751
 (iii) Cast iron ﬂ ywheel has excellent ability to 
damp vibrations.
However, cast iron has poor tensile strength 
compared to steel. The failure of cast iron ﬂ ywheel 
is sudden and total. The machinability of cast iron 
ﬂ ywheel is poor compared to steel ﬂ ywheel. The 
mass density of materials used for the ﬂ ywheel is 
given in Table 21.1.
More recently, ﬂ ywheels are made of high strength 
steels and composites in vehicle applications. 
Graphite-Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) is 
considered as an excellent choice for ﬂ ywheels 
ﬁ tted on modern car engines.

 To = load or output torque (N-m)
 I = mass moment of inertia of ﬂ ywheel (kg-m2)
 w = angular velocity of shaft (rad/s) (dq/dt)
Fig. 21.3 Torque on Flywheel Shaft
When the driving torque is more than the 
load torque, the term (Ti – To) is positive and the
ﬂ ywheel is accelerated. When the driving torque
is less than the load torque, the term (Ti – To) is 
negative indicating retardation of ﬂ ywheel. A T–q 
diagram for a particular application is shown in Fig. 
21.4(a). In this case, the power is supplied to the 
machine by a constant-torque motor, developing a 
torque Tm. The work cycle of the driven machine 
consists of three parts—AB, BC and CD. During 
the elements AB and CD, the torque required by 
the machine remains constant at T1. At the point 
B, it increases to T2 and remains constant during 
the element BC. The cycle is repeated for each 
revolution.

During the ﬁ rst element AB, the torque required 
by the machine is less than that supplied by the motor 
(Tl < Tm). The ﬂ ywheel is, therefore, accelerated and 
its angular velocity increases to wmax. at the point 
B. During the element BC, the torque required by 
the machine is more than the torque supplied by 
the motor (T2 > Tm). The ﬂ ywheel is retarded and 
its angular velocity decreases to wmin. at point 
C. This variation in angular velocity is shown in
Fig. 21.4(b).

The turning moment diagram for a multi-cylinder 
engine is shown in Fig. 21.5. The intercepted areas 
between the torque developed by the engine and the 
mean torque line, taken in order from one end are
–a1, + a2, – a3, + a4, – a5, + a6, and – a7 respectively. 
Flywheel 753
Fig. 21.5 Turning Moment Diagram
It is assumed that the energy stored in the ﬂ ywheel 
is U at the point A. Therefore,
Energy at B = U – a1
Energy at C = U – a1 + a2 
Energy at D = U – a1 + a2 – a3
Energy at E = U – a1 + a2 – a3 + a4
Energy at F = U – a1 + a2 – a3 + a4 – a5
Energy at G = U – a1 + a2 – a3 + a4 – a5 + a6
Energy at H = U – a1 + a2 – a3 + a4 – a5 + a6 – a7 = U
Suppose, the maximum and minimum energy 
occurs at points E and B. The angular velocity of 
the ﬂ ywheel will be maximum at the point E and 
minimum at the point B.
Maximum energy = Energy at E
 
= U – a1 + a2 – a3 + a4
Minimum energy = Energy at B = U – a1
The maximum ﬂ uctuation of energy is deﬁ ned 
as the difference between the maximum kinetic 
energy and minimum kinetic energy in the cycle. It 
is denoted by Uo.
 Uo = UE – UB = (U – a1 + a2 – a3 + a4) – (U – a1) 
 
= a2 – a3 + a4 
The coefﬁ cient of ﬂ uctuation of energy is deﬁ ned 
as the ratio of the maximum ﬂ uctuation of energy to 
the work done per cycle. It is denoted by Ce. 
Ce = maximum fluctuations of energy
work done per cycle

work done per cycle  
 (21.9)
The work done per cycle is given by,
 Work done/cycle = area below mean torque line  
 
from 0° to 360°
 Work done/cycle = (2p)Tm 
(21.10)
(for two stroke engine)  
In case of two-stroke internal combustion engine, 
the crank rotation is (2p) radians per cycle. In case 
of a four-stroke internal combustion engine, the 
crank rotation is (4p) radians per cycle. Therefore,
 Work done/cycle = (4 p)Tm 
 (21.11)
 (for four stroke engine)
The values of the coefﬁ cient of ﬂ uctuations of

Example 21.1 
A machine is driven by a motor, 
which exerts a constant torque. The resisting torque 
of the machine increases uniformly from 500 N-m 
to 1500 N-m through a 360° rotation of the driving 
shaft and drops suddenly to 500 N-m again at the 
beginning of the next revolution. The mean angular 
velocity of the machine is 30 rad/s and the coefﬁ cient 
of speed ﬂ uctuations is 0.2. A solid circular steel 
disk, 25 mm thick, is used as ﬂ ywheel. The mass 
density of steel is 7800 kg/m3 while Poisson’s ratio 
is 0.3. Calculate the outer radius of the ﬂ ywheel disk 
and the maximum stresses induced in it.

Example 21.2 The torque developed by an engine 
is given by the following equation:
 
T = 14 250 + 2200 sin 2q – 1800 cos 2q
where T is the torque in N-m and q is the crank angle 
from the inner dead centre position. The resisting 
torque of the machine is constant throughout the 
work cycle. The coefﬁ cient of speed ﬂ uctuations is 
0.01. The engine speed is 150 rpm. A solid circular 
steel disk, 50 mm thick, is used as a ﬂ ywheel. The 
mass density of steel is 7800 kg/m3. Calculate the 
radius of the ﬂ ywheel disk.
Solution
Given n = 150 rpm Cs = 0.01 t = 50 mm
 
r = 7800 kg/m3

The ﬂ uctuating terms (sin 2q) and (cos 2q) have a 
zero mean. Therefore, the mean torque is given by,

21.7 RIMMED FLYWHEEL
The solid disk ﬂ ywheel discussed in Section 21.6 is 
rarely used in practice. In most cases, the ﬂ ywheel 
756 Design of Machine Elements
consists of a rim, a hub and four to six spokes as shown 
in Fig. 21.1. Due to the complicated geometric shapes 
of its component parts, it is difﬁ cult to determine 
the exact moment of inertia of this ﬂ ywheel. 
Therefore, the analysis of such a ﬂ ywheel is done 
by using anyone of the following two assumptions:
 
(i) The spokes, the hub and the shaft do not 
contribute any moment of inertia, and the 
entire moment of inertia is due to the rim 
alone.
 
(ii) The effect of spokes, the hub and the shaft is 
to contribute 10% of the required moment of 
inertia, while the rim contributes 90%.
The moment of inertia of the rim is, therefore, 
given by
 
Ir = KI 
(a)
where,
Ir = moment of inertia of rim (kg-m2)
I = required moment of inertia (kg-m2)
The factor K is equal to 1 when the entire 
moment of inertia is due to the rim alone. The factor 
K is taken as 0.9, when it is assumed that the rim 
contributes 90% of the required moment of inertia. 
From Eq. 21.4,

 (21.14)
The thickness of the rim is usually very small 
compared with the mean radius. Therefore, it is 
assumed that the radius of gyration of the rim is 
equal to the mean radius and
 
Ir = mr R2 
(21.15)
where,
mr = mass of the rim (kg)
R = mean radius of the rim (m)
In the design of a ﬂ ywheel, many times it is 
required to decide the mean radius of the rim. From 
Eq. 21.15, it is seen that the mass of the ﬂ ywheel 
can be considerably reduced by increasing the mean 
radius for a required amount of moment of inertia. 
The aim should be to use the largest possible radius 
because it reduces the weight. However, there are 
two limiting factors—speed and availability of 
space. In some cases, the diameter of the ﬂ ywheel is 
governed by the amount of space, which is available 
for the ﬂ ywheel. Flywheels are usually made of grey 
cast iron, for which the limiting mean rim velocity is 
30 m/s. When the velocity exceeds this limit, there 
is a possibility of bursting due to centrifugal force, 
resulting in an explosion. Since,
 
v = wR
 
R < 30
w  
(21.16)
For high-speed applications, cast steel is used as 
ﬂ ywheel material.
21.8 STRESSES IN RIMMED FLYWHEEL
A portion of a rimmed ﬂ ywheel made of grey 
cast iron is shown in Fig. 21.9. The rotating rim 
is subjected to a uniformly distributed centrifugal 
force Pc, which acts in a radially outward direction. 
This induces a tensile force P in the cross-section of 
the rim acting in tangential direction and a bending 
moment M. Under the action of centrifugal force, 
the tendency of the rim is to ﬂ y outward, which is 
prevented due to the tensile force P1 acting in each 
spoke. The tensile stress in the spoke is given by
 
st
P
A
=

 (a)
where,
P1 = tensile force in each spoke (N)
A1 = cross-sectional area of spoke (mm2)
st = tensile stress in spokes (N/mm2)

The rim is subjected to direct tensile stress due 
to P, and bending stresses due to M. The resultant 
stresses in the rim are given by,

 (b)
where,
 P = tensile force in rim (N)
 M = bending moment on rim section (N-mm)
 b = width of rim (mm)
 
t = thickness of rim (mm) 
The expressions for P1, P and M have been 
derived by S Timoshenko1. His analysis is based on 
the following assumptions:
 
(i) the thickness of the rim is small in comparison 
with the mean radius and stresses due to 
bending moment and tension alone are taken 
into account; and
 
(ii) the length of the spoke is considered to 
be equal to the mean radius, although, in 
practice, it is somewhat less than the mean 
radius.

Example 21.3 The turning moment diagram of a 
multi-cylinder engine is drawn with a scale of (1 mm 
= 1°) on the abscissa and (1 mm = 250 N-m) on the 
ordinate. The intercepted areas between the torque 
developed by the engine and the mean resisting 
torque of the machine, taken in order from one end 
are – 350, + 800, – 600, + 900, – 550, + 450 and 
–650 mm2. The engine is running at a mean speed 
of 750 rpm and the coefﬁ cient of speed ﬂ uctuations 
is limited to 0.02. A rimmed ﬂ ywheel made of grey 
cast iron FG 200 (r = 7100 kg/m3) is provided. The 
spokes, hub and shaft are assumed to contribute 
10% of the required moment of inertia. The rim has 
rectangular cross-section and the ratio of width to 
thickness is 1.5.
Determine the dimensions of the rim.

It is assumed that the energy stored in the ﬂ ywheel 
is U at point A. Therefore,
Energy at B = U – 350
Energy at C = U – 350 + 800 = U + 450 
Energy at D = U + 450 – 600 = U – 150 
Energy at E = U – 150 + 900 = U + 750 
Energy at F = U + 750 – 550 = U + 200 
Energy at G = U + 200 + 450 = U + 650 
Energy at H = U + 650 – 650 = U
The maximum and minimum energy occurs at 
points E and B. The angular velocity of the ﬂ ywheel 
will be maximum at the point E and minimum at the 
point B.

Example 21.4 
It is required to design a rimmed 
ﬂ ywheel for an engine consisting of three single 
acting cylinders with their cranks set equally at 
120° to each other. The torque-crank angle diagram 
for each cylinder consists of a triangle with the

The engine runs at a mean speed of 240 rpm and 
the coefﬁ cient of speed ﬂ uctuations is limited to

0.03. The resisting torque of the machine is constant 
throughout the work cycle. From considerations of 
space, the mean radius of the rim should not exceed 
0.25 m. It can be assumed that the rim contributes 
90% of the required moment of inertia. The ﬂ ywheel 
is made of grey cast iron FG 220 (r = 7150 kg/m3). 
The cross-section of the rim is square. Determine 
the dimensions of the cross-section of the rim.

The resultant torque diagram is shown in

the torques developed by each cylinder at a given 
crank angle. It follows a linear variation from 150 
N-m to 300 N-m. A and B are points of intersection 
of this diagram with the mean torque line. From the 
geometry of straight lines, it can be easily proved 
that the crank angles at points A and B are 30° 
and 90° respectively. The angular velocity of the 
ﬂ ywheel is maximum at the point B and minimum 
at the point A. Therefore,

The following data is given for a

width of rim = 300 mm
number of spokes = 6

Example 21.7 
 A rimmed ﬂ ywheel made of grey 
cast iron FG 200 (r = 7100 kg/m3)  is required to 
keep down ﬂ uctuations in speed from 200 to 220 
rpm. The cyclic ﬂ uctuations in energy is 30 000 
N-m, while the maximum torque during the cycle is 
75 000 N-m. The outside diameter of the ﬂ ywheel 
should not exceed 2 m. It can be assumed that there 
are six spokes and the rim contributes 90% of the 
required moment of inertia. The cross-section of the 
rim is rectangular and the ratio of width to thickness 
is 2. Determine the dimensions of the rim. Assuming 
suitable cross-section for spokes, calculate the 
stresses in the rim and the spokes using Timoshenko’s 
expressions.  
Solution
Given n = 200 to 220 rpm b/t = 2 K = 0.9
r = 7100 kg/m3 Uo = 30 000 N-m
outer diameter < 2 m number of spokes = 6

Flywheel 763
Example 21.8  The layout of a punching press 
using slider-crank mechanism is illustrated in
Fig. 21.13. It consists of a pinion P1 mounted on 
a motor shaft and the driving gear G1. The motor 
speed is 720 rpm. The pinion P2 mounted on the 
intermediate shaft drives the gear G2. The crank 
of the slider-crank mechanism is ﬁ xed to the gear 
G2. The speed reduction of the gear train is such 
that 20 holes are punched per minute. The gear G1, 
pinion P2 and ﬂ ywheel are mounted on the same 
intermediate shaft that rotates at 100 rpm. The 
following data is given: 
diameter of the hole to be punched = 25 mm
thickness of the plate = 10 mm
shear resistance of plate material = 300 MPa
mean diameter of rim = 1 m

The actual punching operation takes 25% of the 
time interval between two consecutive punching 
operations. The force–displacement curve during 
punching can be assumed to be triangular in shape. 
Assume that the rim contributes 90% of the required 
moment of inertia. The rimmed ﬂ ywheel is made of 
grey cast iron FG 200 (r = 7100 kg/m3). The cross-
section of the rim is a rectangle with a width to 
thickness ratio of 1.5. Determine
 
(i) power of electric motor to drive the press; 
and
 
(ii) dimensions of the rim.
Solution
Given n = 100 rpm b/t = 1.5 Cs = 0.1
K = 0.9 r = 7100 kg/m3 2R = 1 m h = 0.98
For punched holes, d = 25 mm t = 10 mm
t = 300 MPa
Step I Power of electric motor to drive press
t = shear resistance = 300 MPa = 300 N/mm2
The force P required to shear the hole is given 
by,
 P = pdtt = p (25)(10)(300) = 235 619.45 N

punching operation is shown in Fig. 21.14.

 Actual punching time = 0.25 (3) = 0.75 s  
The work done during one punching operation

Example 21.9 Treating the rim of a rimmed 
ﬂ ywheel as a free rotating ring and neglecting the 
effect of spokes, prove that the tensile stress in the 
rim cross-section is given by,
 
st = rv2 
where,
st = tensile stress in rim cross-section (N/m2)
 
r = mass density (kg/m3)
 
v = velocity at mean radius (m/s)
Solution Consider the forces acting on the half 
rim as shown in Fig. 21.16. The rim is in equilibrium 
under the action of two forces—inertia force which 
is uniformly distributed in the radial direction and 
the tensile force P at the rim cross-section. At an 
angle q, consider an elemental section shown by the
Fig. 21.16 Rim as Free Rotating Body
shaded area. The volume of this element is (btR dq) 
and the elemental mass is given by,
 
dm = btRdqr 
where the thickness t, width b and mean radius R are 
in metres. The elemental inertia force dF acting on 
this element is given by,
 
dF = mass ¥ acceleration
 
dF = (btRdqr) (Rw2) 
Since, 
v = Rw
 
dF = btrv2dq

Flywheel 765
Example 21.10 A geared crank type press consists 
of a mechanism similar to one illustrated in Fig. 
21.13. It absorbs 25 kN-m of work from ﬂ ywheel 
during the last 30° of crank rotation. The crank rotates 
at 120 rpm. The ﬂ ywheel rotates three times faster. 
The ﬂ ywheel has rimmed type construction with four 
spokes and a hub. It is made of grey cast iron FG 200
(Sut = 200 N/mm2 and r = 7100 kg/m3). The outer 
diameter of the ﬂ ywheel should be within 1200 mm. 
The ﬂ ywheel is to keep down the ﬂ uctuations in 
speed within 12% of normal speed. Assume linear 
variation of the torque during 30° of crank rotation 
when punching takes place.
 
(i) The rim contributes 90% of the required 
moment of inertia. Determine the dimensions 
of the cross-section of the rim, if it has a 
square cross-section. 
 
(ii) Determine the stress in the rim treating it as 
a free rotating ring.
 (iii) The ﬂ ywheel is keyed to a shaft made of plain 
carbon steel 40C8 (Sut= 650 N/mm2 and Syt 
= 380 N/mm2). Neglecting bending moment, 
determine the shaft diameter as per ASME 
code if 
 
Kt = 2.0
 (iv) Determine the hub diameter.
 
(v) The spokes have elliptical cross-section with 
major axis of the ellipse equal to twice of 
the minor axis. Each spoke transmits equal 
load from the mean radius of the rim to the 
surface of the hub. Assume that the spoke 
acts as a cantilever beam ﬁ xed at the hub 
surface and subjected to force at the mean 
radius of the rim. Determine the dimensions 
of the cross-section of the spokes based on 
simple bending theory if the factor of safety 
is 2.5.
Solution
Given For ﬂ ywheel, outer diameter < 1200 mm
Uo = 25 kN-m 
n = 3(120) rpm 
b/t = 1
Cs = 0.12 K = 0.9 r = 7100 kg/m3
Sut = 200 N/mm2 For shaft, Sut = 650 N/mm2
Syt = 380 N/mm2 Kt = 2.0 For spokes, b = 2a
(fs) = 2.5 Number of spokes = 4
Step I Dimensions of cross-section of rim 
The outer diameter of the rim is to be within 1200 
mm. Therefore, it is assumed that the mean radius of 
the rim is 0.5 m. 
 
R = 0.5 m

(mass density = 7100 kg/m3) is used on a 
punching press running at a mean speed of

22.1 THIN CYLINDERS
Cylindrical pressure vessels are divided into two 
groups—thin and thick cylinders. A cylinder is 
considered thin when the ratio of its inner diameter to 
the wall thickness is more than 15. Boiler shells, pipes, 
tubes, and storage tanks are treated as thin cylinders. 
As shown in Fig. 22.1, there are two principal 
stresses in thin cylinder—the circumferential or 
tangential stress (st) and longitudinal stress (s1). It 
is assumed that the stresses are uniformly distributed 
over the wall thickness. Considering equilibrium of 
forces acting on the half portion of cylinder of unit 
length [Fig. 22.1(a)],

 (22.2)
From Eqs 22.1 and 22.2, it is seen that the 
circumferential stress (st) is twice the longitudinal 
stress (s1). Therefore, we have the following criteria:
 
(i) When the circumferential stress exceeds the 
yield strength, failure will occur lengthwise. 
Also, when the longitudinal stress exceeds 
the yield strength, failure will occur in the 
transverse section. It can be concluded that 
in case of thin cylinders subjected to internal 
pressure, the tendency to burst lengthwise is 
twice as great as at transverse section.
 
(ii) In case of thin cylinders subjected to internal 
pressure, the circumferential stress should 
be the criterion for determining the cylinder 
wall thickness.
  
 Equation 22.1 is rewritten as,

t

 (22.3)
 
 where (st) is the permissible tensile stress 
for cylinder material. In this analysis, it is 
assumed that there are no longitudinal or 
circumferential joints in the cylinder.

Example 22.1 
A seamless cylinder with a storage 
capacity of 0.025 m3 is subjected to an internal 
pressure of 20 MPa. The length of the cylinder is 
twice its internal diameter. The cylinder is made of 
plain carbon steel 20C8 (Sut = 390 N/mm2) and the 
factor of safety is 2.5. Determine the dimensions of 
the cylinder.

22.3 THICK CYLINDERS—PRINCIPAL  
 STRESSES
When the ratio of the inner diameter of the cylinder 
to the wall thickness is less than 15, the cylinder 
is called a ‘thick-walled’ cylinder or simply ‘thick’ 
cylinder. Hydraulic cylinders, high-pressure pipes 
and gun barrels are examples of thick cylinders. The 
difference between the analysis of stresses in thin 
and thick cylinders is as follows:
 
(i) In thin cylinders, it is assumed that the 
tangential stress (st) is uniformly distributed 
over the cylinder wall thickness. In thick 
cylinders, the tangential stress (st) has 
highest magnitude at the inner surface of the 
cylinder and gradually decreases towards 
the outer surface.
 
(ii) The radial stress (sr) is neglected in thin 
cylinders, while it is of signiﬁ cant magnitude 
in case of thick cylinders.
In this section, it is assumed that the cylinder 
is subjected to only internal pressure as shown in 
Fig. 22.4(a). Consider an elemental ring of radius 
r and radial thickness dr as shown in Fig. 22.4(b). 
(sr) and (st) are radial and tangential stresses 
respectively. Considering the equilibrium of vertical 
forces,
2stdr + 2(r + dr) (sr + dsr) = 2rsr 
Neglecting the term (dr ¥ dsr), the above 
expression is written as,

There are a number of equations for the design 
of thick cylinders. The choice of equation depends 
upon two parameters—cylinder material (whether 
brittle or ductile) and condition of cylinder ends 
(open or closed). In this chapter, we will discuss 
only important equations.
22.4 LAME’S EQUATION
When the material of the cylinder is brittle, such 
as cast iron or cast steel, Lame’s equation is used 
to determine the wall thickness. It is based on the 
maximum principal stress theory of failure, where 
maximum principal stress is equated to permissible 
stress for the material. As discussed in the preceding 
772 Design of Machine Elements
section, the three principal stresses at the inner 
surface of the cylinder are as follows:

22.5 CLAVARINO’S AND BIRNIE’S   
 EQUATIONS
When the material of the cylinder is ductile, such as 
mild steel or alloy steel, maximum strain theory of 
failure is used as a criterion to indicate failure. This 
theory is also called St Venant’s theory. According to 
this theory, the material begins to yield or begins to 
fail when the maximum strain at a point equals the 
yield point strain in a simple tension test. The three 
principal stresses at the inner surface of the cylinder

(Birnie’s equation)  
(22.15)
Birnie’s equation is applicable to open cylinders 
made of ductile material.
 In addition to the above mentioned equations, 
one more equation called Barlow’s equation is 
sometimes used. It is used for high-pressure oil and 
gas pipes. Barlow’s equation is given by,
 
t
PD
i
o
t
= 2s
 
 (Barlow’s equation)
where Do is the outer diameter of the cylinder. 
Barlow’s equation is analogous to thin cylinder 
equation except that the outer diameter (Do) is used 
instead of inner the diameter (Di). Barlow’s equation 
is approximate. 
Example 22.3 
The piston rod of a hydraulic 
cylinder exerts an operating force of 10 kN. The 
friction due to piston packing and stufﬁ ng box 
is equivalent to 10% of the operating force. The 
pressure in the cylinder is 10 MPa. The cylinder is 
made of cast iron FG 200 and the factor of safety is 
5. Determine the diameter and the thickness of the 
cylinder.
Solution
Given Pi = 10 MPa Sut = 200 N/mm2 (fs) = 5
piston force = 10 kN effect of friction = 10% of 
piston force

22.7 AUTOFRETTAGE
Autofrettage is a process of pre-stressing the 
cylinder before using it in service. It is used in case 
of high-pressure cylinders and gun barrels. When 
the cylinder is subjected to internal pressure, the 
circumferential stress (st) at the inner surface limits 
the pressure capacity of the cylinder. In the pre-
stressing process, residual compres sive stresses are 
developed at the inner surface. When the cylinder is 
loaded in service, the residual compressive stresses 
at the inner surface begin to decrease, become 
zero and ﬁ nally become tensile as the pressure is 
gradually increased. There are three methods of pre-
stressing the cylinder. They are as follows:
 
(i) A compound cylinder consists of two 
concentric cylinders with the outer cylinder 
shrunk onto the inner one. This induces 
compressive stresses in the inner cylinder. 
The compound cylinder is extensively used 
in practice.
 
(ii) The second method consists of overloading 
the cylinder before it is put into service. The 
overloading pressure is adjusted in such a 
way that a portion of the cylinder near the 
inner diameter is subjected to stresses in the 
plastic range, while the outer portion is still 
in the elastic range. When the pressure is 
released, the outer portion contracts exerting 
pressure on the inner portion which has 
undergone permanent deformation. This 
induces residual compressive stresses at the 
inner surface.
 (iii) In the third method, a wire under tension is 
closely wound around the cylinder, which 
results in residual compressive stresses.
Autofrettage increases the pressure capacity of 
the cylinder. It has another advantage. The residual 
compressive stresses close the cracks within the 
cylinder resulting in increased endurance strength.
22.8 COMPOUND CYLINDER
A compound cylinder, consisting of a cylinder and a 
jacket is shown in Fig. 22.7(a). The inner diameter of 
the jacket is slightly smaller than the outer diameter 
of the cylinder. When the jacket is heated, it expands 
sufﬁ ciently to move over the cylinder. As the jacket 
cools, it tends to contract onto the inner cylinder, 
which induces residual compressive stresses. There 
is a shrinkage pressure P between the cylinder and 
the jacket. The pressure P tends to contract the 
cylinder and expand the jacket as shown in Fig. 22.7 
(b) and (c).
Let, 
 
dj = increase in inner diameter of jacket
 
 dc = decrease in outer diameter of cylinder

The shrinkage pressure P can be evaluated from 
the above equation for a given amount of interference 
(d). The resultant stresses in a compound cylinder are 
found by superimposing the two stresses—stresses 
due to shrink ﬁ t and those due to internal pressure.
Example 22.6 
A high-pressure cylinder consists 
of a steel tube with inner and outer diameters of 20 
and 40 mm respectively. It is jacketed by an outer 
steel tube, having an outer diameter of 60 mm. 
The tubes are assembled by a shrinking process in 
such a way that maximum principal stress induced 
in any tube is limited to 100 N/mm2. Calculate the 
shrinkage pressure and original dimensions of the 
tubes (E = 207 kN/mm2).
Solution
Given D1= 20 mm D2 = 40 mm D3 = 60 mm
smax. = 100 N/mm2 E = 207 kN/mm2

22.9 GASKETS
A gasket is a device used to create and maintain 
a barrier against the transfer of ﬂ uid across the 
mating surfaces of a mechanical assembly. It is used 
in static joints, such as cylinder block and cylinder 
head. There are two types of gaskets—metallic and 
non-metallic. Metallic gaskets consist of sheets of 
780 Design of Machine Elements
lead, copper or aluminium. Non-metallic gaskets are 
made of asbestos, cork, rubber or plastics. Metallic 
gaskets are used for high-temperature and high-
pressure applications. They can have corrugated 
construction or they can be made in the form of 
plain sheets. The limiting temperatures of metallic 
gaskets are as follows.
Lead
90°C
Copper/brass
250°C
Aluminium
400°C
The metallic gasket takes a permanent set when 
compressed in assembly and there is no recovery to 
compensate for separation of contact faces. They 
are also suscep tible to corrosion and chemical 
atmosphere. Their performance also depends upon 
surface ﬁ nish of the contacting surfaces.
Asbestos gaskets have excellent resistance to 
crushing loads and cutting action due to sharp edges of 
the ﬂ anges. Dimensional stability is another advantage. 
They are used in cylinder heads, water and steam-
pipe ﬁ ttings and manifold connections. Vulcanized 
compounds of rubber and cork are employed as 
gaskets in steam lines, combustion chambers and 
chemical environment. They are used for applications 
involving irregular surfaces. They are of low cost, but 
are affected by fungus and alkalis. Rubber compounds 
have excellent impermeability and ability to ﬂ ow into 
joint imperfections when compressed. Asbestos gaskets 
can be used up to 250°C, while other non-metallic 
gaskets have a limiting temperature of 70°C. Different 
shapes of gasket for cylinder head are illustrated in
Fig. 22.10.
Fig. 22.10 Shapes of Gasket
22.10  GASKETED JOINT
A bolted assembly of cylinder, cylinder head and 
gasket is shown in Fig. 22.11. Initially, the bolt 
is tightened by means of a spanner to induce a 
preload Pl. The stiffness or spring constant k of a 
machine element is the load required to produce unit 
deﬂ ection. It is given by the ratio of the load to the 
deﬂ ection produced by that load. When machine 
member is loaded in tension or compression,

(N/mm2)
There are three members in the grip of the bolt—

area of ﬂ anges compressed by the bolt. As shown 
in Fig. 22.11, it is assumed that a hollow circular 
area of (3d) and (d) as outer and inner diameters 
respectively is under the grip of the bolt.

to the ﬂ anges, it is the gasket that is compressed 
during the tightening of the bolt. In such cases, the 
ﬂ anges are neglected and the stiffness of the gasket 
is considered to be kc.
When the bolt is tightened with a preload Pl, 
the bolt is elongated by an amount (db) and the two 
ﬂ anges with the gasket are compressed by an amount 
(dc). When the stresses are within the elastic limit,

The load-deﬂ ection diagram is shown in
Fig. 22.12. Line OA represents elongation of the 
bolt, while line CA indicates the compression of the 
ﬂ anges. The slope of the line CA is negative because 
it indicates compression.
When the cylinder is assembled and put into 
service, it is further subjected to an external load 
Pi operating inside the vessel. The effect of Pi is as 
follows.
 
(i)  The bolts are further elongated by an amount 
(Dd) and there is a corresponding increase in 
the bolt load which is denoted by (DPi). This 
is represented by line AB .
Fig. 22.12 Deﬂ ection Diagram for Bolted Assembly
 
(ii) The compression of two ﬂ anges and the 
gasket is relieved by a magnitude (Dd), and 
there is a corresponding reduction in load. 
The reduction in load is (Pi – DPi) which is 
represented by the line AD.

When there is no gasket, the ﬂ anges are more 
rigid than the steel bolt, or
 
kc > kb
782 Design of Machine Elements
When (kc) is extremely large compared to (kb), 
the expression within bracket has a limiting value 
of zero, and
 
P = Pl
which indicates that almost all of the external load 
Pi is borne by the ﬂ anges to relieve their initial 
compression. This may lead to leakage between two 
ﬂ anges.
When there is a gasket of elastic material,
 
kb > kc
When (kb) is too large compared with (kc), the 
expression within bracket has a limiting value of 
one, and
 
P = Pl + Pi
which indicates that a major portion of the external 
load is borne by the bolt. This is desirable for 
leakproof joints. 
Referring to Fig. 22.12, the elongation of the 
bolt will continue along the line OA as the operating 
pressure is gradually increased. The limiting point 
is M, where the compression of ﬂ anges becomes 
zero and the joint is on the verge of opening. The 
corresponding load (Pmax.) indicates the capacity of 
the cylinder to bear the load.

internal pressure is limited to 2 MPa. The cover 
is ﬁ xed to the cylinder by means of 16 bolts with a 
nominal diameter of 20 mm. Each bolt is initially 
tightened with a preload of 20 kN. The bolts are 
made of steel FeE 250 (Syt = 250 N/mm2). Assume
E for steel = 207 kN/mm2

22.11  UNFIRED PRESSURE VESSELS
An unﬁ red pressure vessel is deﬁ ned as a vessel or 
a pipeline for carrying, storing or receiving steam, 
gases or liquids at pressures above the atmospheric 
pressure. Such pressure vessels are designed 
according to national and international codes1.
The Indian standard code for pressure vessels gives 
the design procedure for welded pressure vessels 
that are made of ferrous materials and subjected
to internal pressure from 1 kgf/cm2 to 200 
kgf/cm2. (1 kgf = 9.81 N). Small pressure vessels 
with diameters less than 150 mm or water containers 
with capacities of less than 500 litres do not come 
under the scope of this code. The code does not 
include steam boilers, nuclear pressure vessels or 
hot water storage tanks.
The construction of a welded pressure vessel is 
shown in Fig. 22.14. There are four categories of 
welded joints—A, B, C and D. The term category 
deﬁ nes only the location of welded joint in the 
vessel and never implies the type of welded joint. 
The welded joints included in four categories are as 
follows.
(i) Category A Longitudinal welded joints within 
the main shell, communicating chambers and 
nozzles, circumferential joints connecting the 
end closure to the main shell, any welded joint in 
spherical or formed head
 1 IS 2825–1969: Code for unﬁ red pressure vessels.
Fig. 22.14 Welded Joints in Pressure Vessel
(ii) Category B Circumferential welded joints in 
the main shell, communicating chambers or nozzles
(iii) Category C Welded joints connecting ﬂ anges 
and ﬂ at heads to the main shell
784 Design of Machine Elements
(iv) Category 
D Welded 
joints 
connecting 
communi-cating chambers and nozzles to the main 
shell
Pressure vessels are classiﬁ ed into three 
groups—Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3. Class 1 
pressure vessels are used to contain lethal and 
toxic substances. They include poisonous gases 
and liquids that are dangerous to human life, e.g., 
hydrocyanic acid, carbonyl chloride or mustard 
gas. Liqueﬁ ed petroleum gas is not classiﬁ ed as a 
lethal substance. Class 1 pressure vessels are also 
used when the operating temperature is less than
–20°C. There are two types of welded joints used 
in these vessels—double welded butt joint with full 
penetration and single welded butt joint with backing 
strip. Welded joints of Class 1 pressure vessels are 
fully radiographed.
Class 2 pressure vessels are those which do 
not come under Class 1 or Class 3 categories. The 
maximum thickness of the main shell in this case 
is limited to 38 mm. The types of welded joints in 
Class 2 pressure vessels are the same as those in 
Class 1. However, in Class 2 pressure vessels, the 
welded joints are spot radiographed. Class 3 pressure 
vessels are used for relatively light duties. They are 
not recommended for service when the operating 
temperature is less than 0°C or more than 250°C. 
The maximum pressure is limited to 17.5 kgf/cm2 
(1 kgf = 9.81 N) while the maximum shell thickness 
is limited to 16 mm. They are usually made from 
carbon and low alloy steels. Welded joints in Class 
3 pressure vessels are not radiographed.
There are three terms related to pressure—
working pressure, design pressure and hydrostatic 
test pressure. The maximum working pressure is that 
which is permitted for the vessel in operation. It is the 
pressure required for the processes that are carried 
out inside the pressure vessel. The design pressure 
(P) is the pressure used in design calculations for 
such quantities as the shell thickness and also in 
the design of other attachments like nozzles and 
openings. The design pressure is obtained by adding 
a minimum 5% to the maximum working pressure, or
Design pressure = 1.05 (maximum working  
 
pressure)
The pressure vessel is ﬁ nally tested by the 
hydrostatic test. The hydrostatic test pressure is 
taken as 1.3 times the design pressure. Therefore,
Hydrostatic test pressure = 1.3 (design pressure)
Pressure vessels are fabricated from steel plates 
welded together by the fusion welding process. 
In fusion welding, the weld is made in a state of 
fusion without hammering. It includes arc welding, 
gas welding, thermit welding and electron beam 
welding. The term weld joint efﬁ ciency is often used 
in pressure vessel design. It is deﬁ ned as the ratio 
of the strength of the welded joint to the strength of 
the plates. The magnitude of weld joint efﬁ ciency 
(h) depends upon two factors—the type of weld 
and the method of weld inspection. The three types 
of commonly used welded joints are shown in
Fig. 22.15. The weld joint efﬁ ciency of these joints 
is given in Table 22.1.

22.12 THICKNESS OF CYLINDRICAL  
 AND SPHERICAL SHELLS
The equations for the thickness of cylindrical or 
spherical shells are based on the theory of thin 
cylinders, with suitable modiﬁ cations. The thickness 
of a cylindrical shell subjected to internal pressure, 
as shown in Fig. 22.16, is given by,

 st = allowable stress for the plate material
  
 (N/mm2)
 h = weld joint efﬁ ciency
CA = corrosion allowance (mm)
Fig. 22.16 Cylindrical Shell
The allowable stresses for the plate material are 
obtained from the following expressions:
 
st = Yield strength (or 0.2% proof stress)
1.5
 
st = Ultimate tensilestrength
3 0.
The factor of safety of 1.5 or 3 in the above 
expressions is used under the following two 
operating conditions:
 
(i) the pressure vessel is operating at room 
temperature; and
 
(ii) the pressure inside the vessel is not 
ﬂ uctuating.
For high temperature applications, the values of 
allowable stresses at design temperature are given 
in the standard. The values of yield strength (Syt) 
for commonly used carbon and low alloy steels are 
given in Table 22.2.
The walls of the pressure vessel are subjected to 
thinning due to corrosion, which reduces the useful 
life of the vessel. Corrosion in pressure vessels is of 
the following forms:
 
(i) Chemical attack where the metal is dissolved

Provision has to be made by suitable increase 
in wall thickness to compensate for the thinning 
due to corrosion. Corrosion Allowance (CA) is 
the additional metal thickness over and above 
that is required to withstand the internal pressure. 
A minimum corrosion allowance of 1.5 mm is 
recommended unless a protective lining is employed.
22.13 END CLOSURES
Formed heads are used as end closures for 
cylindrical pressure vessels. There are two types 
of end closures—domed heads and conical heads. 
The domed heads are further classiﬁ ed into three 
groups—hemispherical, 
semi-ellipsoidal 
and 
torispheri cal, as shown in Fig. 22.17. Hemispherical 
heads have minimum plate thickness, minimum 
weight and consequently lowest material cost. 
However, the amount of forming required to 
produce the hemispherical shape is more, resulting 
in increased forming cost. The thickness of the 
hemispherical head is given by,

Fig. 22.17 Domed Heads
From Eqs (22.31) and (22.32), it is observed that 
the thickness of the semi-ellipsoidal head is more 
(almost twice) than the corresponding hemispheri-
cal head, and to that extent, the material cost is 
more. However, due to the shallow dished shape, 
the forming cost is reduced.
The length of the straight portion (Sf) is given 
by,
Sf = 3t or 20 mm (whichever is more)
Torispherical heads are extensively used as end 
closures for a large variety of cylindrical pressure 
vessels. They are shaped by using two radii—the 
crown radius L and knuckle radius ri. The crown 
radius L is the radius of the dish, which constitutes 
the major portion of the head. The knuckle radius 
ri is the corner radius joining the spherical crown 
with the cylindrical shell. Torispherical heads 
require less forming than semi-ellipsoidal heads. 
Their main drawback is the local stresses at the 
two discontinuities, namely, the junction between 
the crown and the knuckle radius and the junction 
between the knuckle radius and the cylindrical shell. 
The localised stresses may lead to failure due to 
brittle fracture. The thickness of a torispherical head 
is given by,

where L is the inside crown radius.
The knuckle radius ri is taken as 6% of the crown 
radius,
or 
ri = 0.06 L
The crown radius L should not be greater than the 
outside diameter of the cylindrical shell. Therefore,
 
L < Do
Hemispherical and semi-ellipsoidal heads are used 
for tall vertical towers because they are practically 
free from discontinuities. In such cases, the cost of the 
top end closure is only a small part of the total cost of 
the pressure vessel. Also, the space is not a limiting 
factor for vertical pressure vessels. Torispherical 
heads are more economical than other types of 
domed heads. Owing to their compact construction, 
they are used for horizontal pressure vessels such as 
tankers for water, milk, petrol, diesel and kerosene. 
They are also used for small vertical pressure vessels.

Example 22.10 The cylindrical shell shown in Fig. 
22.19(a) is subjected to an operating pressure of 0.75 
MPa. The yield strength of the plate material is 200 
N/mm2 and the corrosion allowance is 3 mm. Spot 
radiographed double welded butt joints are used to 
fabricate the shell, whose internal diameter is 2.5 m. 
Torispherical heads, each with a crown radius of 2 
m, are used as end closure. Determine the thickness 
of the cylindrical shell and the torispherical head.

The knuckle radius ri is given by,

The thickness of the cylindrical shell is 
12 mm while that of the head is 16 mm. As per 
recommendations, the minimum tapered transition 
l should be three times the offset y as shown in 
Fig. 22.19(b). Therefore,
l ≥ 3y or l ≥ 3 (16 – 12) or l > 12 mm
Therefore, 
l = 15 mm
Example 22.11 A horizontal pressure vessel 
consists of a cylindrical shell enclosed by 
hemispherical ends. The volumetric capacity of the 
vessel should be approximately 2 m3 and the length 
should not exceed 3 m. Assuming the thickness 
negligibly small compared with overall dimensions 
of the vessel, determine the internal diameter and 
the length of the cylindrical shell.
The pressure vessel is fabricated from steel plates 
with a yield strength of 255 N/mm2. The weld joint 
efﬁ ciency factor is 0.85 and corrosion allowance 2 
mm. The pressure vessel is subjected to an operating 
pressure of 2 MPa. Calculate the thickness of the 
cylindrical shell and the hemispherical end closures. 
Solution
 Given  Operating pressure = 2 MPa h = 0.85
Syt = 255 N/mm2 CA = 2 mm V = 2 m3

22.14  OPENINGS IN PRESSURE VESSEL
Openings are provided in the pressure vessel; 
these could be an inlet and outlet pipe connections, 
manhole or hand hole, connections for pressure 
gauges, temperature gauges and safety valves. The 
openings are circular, elliptical or obround. The inner 
diameter of a manhole is generally 380 mm. Such 
openings are designed by the area compensation 
method. 
The basic principle of the area compensation 
method is illustrated in Fig. 22.24. When the 
opening is cut in the pressure vessel, an area is 
removed from the shell. It must be reinforced by 
an equal amount of area near the opening. The area 
‘removed’ should be equal to the area ‘added’. 
The area is added by providing a reinforcing pad 
in the form of annular circular plate around the 
opening. It should be noted that in this method, 
we are considering cross-sectional area in the form 
of a rectangular strip. It is not the compensation 
of volume of metal that has been cut due to the 
opening by means of the reinforcing pad. 
792 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 22.24 Principle of Area Compensation
It is not always necessary to replace the actually 
removed area of the metal. The plate of the shell and 
nozzle are usually thicker than would be required to 
withstand pressure. This partially compensates for 
loss of area in the opening. As shown in Fig. 22.25,

The total area available for reinforcement is
(A1 + A2 + A3).
When,
 
(Al + A2 + A3) ≥ A
the opening is adequately reinforced and no 
reinforcing pad is required. When this condition 
is not fulﬁ lled, a reinforcing pad of area A4 is 
required.
 
A4 = A – (Al + A2 + A3) 
(22.35)
Sometimes a reinforcing pad of area equal to A is 
used for the opening to avoid detailed calculations. 
This results in oversized reinforcement.
Example 22.13 A pressure vessel consists of a 
cylindrical shell with an inner diameter of 1500 mm, 
and thickness of 20 mm. It is provided with a nozzle 
with an inner diameter of 250 mm and thickness 
of 15 mm. The yield strength of the material for 
the shell and nozzle is 200 N/mm2 and the design 
pressure is 2.5 MPa. The extension of the nozzle 
inside the vessel is 15 mm. The corrosion allowance 
is 2 mm, while the weld joint efﬁ ciency is 0.85. 
Neglecting the area of welds, determine whether or 
not a reinforcing pad is required for the opening. If 
so, determine the dimensions of pad made from a 
plate of 15 mm thickness.

23.1 OIL SEALS
An oil seal is a mechanical device, made of elastomer 
material, which is used to prevent leakage of ﬂ uid 
between two machine components. An oil seal 
has two important functions, namely, to prevent 
the leakage of expensive lubricating oils from the 
transmission system and to prevent the entry of 
foreign particles like dust or abrasive material into 
the operating medium. The construction of a typical 
commercial oil seal unit is shown in Fig. 23.1. It 
Fig. 23.1 Construction of Oil Seal
consists of an elastomer material, such as synthetic 
rubber and a circumferential spring called garter 
spring. Due to the radial pressure of the garter 
spring, the sealing lip rubs over the surface of the 
rotating shaft and prevents leakage. The diameter of 
the sealing lip is slightly less than the shaft diameter 
and consequently, the seal must be deformed slightly 
while it is mounted on the shaft. The commercial 
oil-seal units offer the following advantages:
 
(i) They are cheap, require small space and are 
easy to install.
 
(ii) They can be used over a wide range of 
lubricating oils and hydraulic ﬂ uids. 
 (iii) They can tolerate, to some extent, the 
misalignment of the shaft and vibrations.
The magnitude of contact pressure between 
the sealing lip and the rotating shaft is the most 
important parameter, affecting the performance of 
the seal. When the magnitude is too large, there is 
excessive friction, resulting in high temperature and 
rapid wear of the sealing lip. On the other hand, 
when the contact pressure is low, there is excessive 
leakage. The correct contact pressure results in a 
very thin ﬁ lm of lubricant between the lip and the 
shaft, which leads to reduced friction, prolonged life 
and good sealing.
The metallic casing of the oil seal is made of 
carbon steel, aluminium or brass. The garter spring 
material is usually carbon steel or stainless steel. The 
rubber compounds used for the lip are as follows:
 
(i) Nitrile compounds for general purpose 
lubricants up to a limiting temperature of 
120°C. These compounds tend to harden in 
high-temperature applications.
 
(ii) Silicon compounds up to a limiting 
temperature of 175°C. These compounds, 
Miscellaneous Machine Elements 797
however, have poor mechanical properties 
and are subject to damage easily during 
rough handling and installation.
 (iii) Fluoro elastomer compounds for a wide range 
of lubricants up to 200°C. They are costly 
compared with other rubber compounds.
The dimensions and tolerances for commercial 
oil seal units are given in Tables 23.1 and 23.21. The 
housing in which the oil seals are mounted must 
provide a press ﬁ t for the seal and be machined 
to the tolerances given in Table 23.2. For proper 
functioning of the oil seal, the shaft should have a 
highly polished surface free from scratches and tool 
marks. Figure 23.2 shows the method of mounting 
the oil seal on the transmission shaft.

23.2 WIRE ROPES
Wire ropes are extensively used in hoisting, haulage 
and material handling equipment. They are also 
used in stationary applications such as guy wires and 
stays. The advantages of wire ropes are as follows:
 
(i) high strength to weight ratio;
 
(ii) silent operation even at high velocities; and 
 (iii) greater reliability.
The constructions of the wire rope are shown 
in Fig. 23.3(a) and (b). The wire rope consists of a 
number of strands, each strand comprising several 
steel wires. The number of wires in each strand is 
generally 7, 19 or 37, while the number of strands is 
 1 IS 5129–1979: Rotary shaft oil seal units.
Table 23.1 (Contd)
798 Design of Machine Elements
usually six. The individual wires are ﬁ rst twisted into 
the strand and then the strands are twisted around a 
ﬁ bre or steel core.
Fig. 23.3 Construction of Wire Rope
The speciﬁ cation of wire ropes includes two 
numbers, such as 6 ¥ 7 or 6 ¥ 19. The ﬁ rst number 
indicates the number of strands in the wire rope, 
while the second gives the number of steel wires in 
each strand. The popular constructions of steel wire 
ropes are as follows:
 
6 × 7 (6/1)
 
6 × 19 (12/6/1)
 
6 × 37 (18/12/6/1)
The mechanical properties of wire ropes2 are 
given in Tables 23.3 and 23.4. In these tables, the 
nominal diameter (dr) of the wire rope indicates the 
diameter of the smallest circle enclosing the wire 
rope. The tensile designation of wires, such as 1570 
or 1770, indicates the minimum ultimate tensile 
strength (in N/mm2) of the individual wires used 
for making the wire rope. The central portion of the 
wire rope is called the core. There are three types 
of cores—ﬁ bre, wire and synthetic material. The 
ﬁ bre core consists of natural ﬁ bres like sisal, hemp, 
jute or cotton. The ﬁ bre core is ﬂ exible and suitable 
for all conditions except when the rope is subjected 
to severe crushing, e.g., when working under high 
load. The steel core consists of another strand of 
fairly soft wires with lower tensile strength. The 
wire core is used where the wire rope is subjected 
to severe heat or crushing conditions. Plastic cores 
are used in special purpose wire ropes. It can be a 
plastic-impregnated ﬁ bre core, plastic covered ﬁ bre 
core or a solid plastic core.

There is one more term related to the construction 
of wire ropes, namely, rope-lay. The lay of the rope 
refers to the manner in which the wires are helically 
laid into strands and the strands into the rope. If the 
wires in the strand are twisted in the same direction 
as the strands, then the rope is called a Lang’s lay 
rope. When the wires in the strand are twisted in a 
direction opposite to that of the strands, the rope is 
said to be regular-lay or ordinary-lay. The lays of 
wire rope are illustrated in Fig. 23.4. 
Miscellaneous Machine Elements 799
Fig. 23.4 Lays of Wire Rope
Regular-lay ropes are more popular than the 
Lang’s-lay ropes. The balance resulting from the 
opposite direction of twisting the strands to that of 
the wires is advantageous. Regular-lay ropes offer 
the following advantages:
 
(i) They have more structural stability.
 
(ii) They have more resistance to crushing and 
distortion.
 (iii) They have less tendency to rotate under 
load.
 (iv) There is less possibility of kinking.
 
(v) They 
are 
easy 
in 
handling 
during 
installation.
In Lang’s-lay ropes, the same direction of twisting 
results in outer wires being bent on a larger arc of 
a circle. Lang’s-lay ropes are difﬁ cult to handle 
and install. They are less resistant to crushing and 
distortion. Lang’s-lay ropes are likely to untwist 
unless both ends are permanently fastened.

In the design of rope drives, it is required to select 
the wire rope from the manufacturer’s catalogue. 
The guidelines for the selection of wire ropes are 
as follows:
 
(i) The strength of the wire rope depends upon 
the tensile strength of the individual wires. 
It is seen from Table 23.3 that wire ropes of 
tensile designation 1960 have higher load 
capacity than those of designation 1570. 
Use of steel cores in place of ﬁ bre cores 
increases the strength of the wire ropes to 
certain extent.
800 Design of Machine Elements
 
(ii) The ﬂ exibility of the wire rope is an important 
consideration where sheaves are small or 
where the rope makes many bends. Flexibility 
in wire ropes is achieved by using a large 
number of small-diameter wires. The wire rope 
of 6 × 7 construction consists of a few wires of 
relatively large size. It is too stiff for hoisting 
purposes. The 6 × 19 or 6 × 37 constructions 
are ﬂ exible wire ropes, and are commonly used 
in hoists. The 6 ¥ 7 construction is suitable as 
a haulage and guy rope.
 (iii) Where the wire rope is likely to drag through 
gritty material or across a stationary object, 
abrasion resistance is the governing factor. 
Large-diameter wires with 6 ¥ 7 construction 
give better wear resistance. 
The factors of safety for wire ropes for different 
applications are given in Tables 23.5 and 23.6.

23.3 STRESSES IN WIRE ROPES 
The analysis of stresses in wire rope is complicated, 
owing to a number of factors. The individual wires 
are subjected to direct tensile stress due to the load 
being raised, as well as to bending stresses. When 
the wire rope passes around the periphery of the 
sheave or the drum, the length of the wires in the 
outer portion of the rope increases, while that in the 
inner region decreases. This results in additional 
tensile stresses in outer wires. The bending stresses 
in one of the individual wires is given by,
 
sb

Therefore,

equal to the radius of the sheave. Therefore,

From the expressions (a) and (b),

 (23.1)
In the above expression, E is the modulus of 
elasticity of the wire. However, the individual wires 
of the wire rope make a corkscrew ﬁ gure in space, 
as they go around the periphery of the sheave. This 
conﬁ guration is different from that of the straight 
circular wire bending around the sheave. To account 
for this difference, the modulus of elasticity E is 
replaced by the effective modulus of elasticity 
Er, called the modulus of elasticity of the rope. 
Replacing E by Er,

 (23.2)
In the design of wire ropes, it is convenient to 
convert the bending stresses into an equivalent 
bending load. It is a hypothetical tensile load 
that would induce the same bending stress. The 
equivalent bending load Pb is given by
 
Pb = sb A

 (23.3)
where A is the area of the metallic cross-section 
in the wire rope. Table 23.7 gives the data for 
representative wire ropes.
The failure of the wire rope is mainly due to 
fatigue or wear, while passing around the sheave. 
The bending and straightening of the rope as it 
passes over the sheave results in ﬂ uctuating stresses 
leading to fatigue failure. The individual wires 
slide on each other and over the sheave resulting in 
gradual wearing of the load carrying material.

The amount of wear that occurs depends upon 
the pressure between the rope and the sheave. As 
shown in Fig. 23.5(a), the force per unit length of 
the wire rope is (pdr). Considering equilibrium of

Example 23.1 
A temporary elevator is assembled 
at the construction site to raise building materials, 
such as cement, to a height of 20 m. It is estimated 
that the maximum weight of the material to be 
raised is 5 kN. It is observed that the acceleration 
in such applications is 1 m/s2. 10 mm diameter, 
6 ¥ 19 construction wire ropes with ﬁ bre core are 
used for this application. The tensile designation of 
the wire is 1570 and the factor of safety should be 10 
for preliminary calculations. Determine the number 
of wire ropes required for this application. Neglect 
bending stresses.
Solution
Given W = 5 kN h = 20 m a = 1 m/s2
For wire rope, construction = 6 ¥ 19
dr = 10 mm tensile designation = 1570 (fs) = 10
Let us assume that the number of wire ropes is 
z. The force acting on each wire rope comprises the 
following factors:
 
(i) the weight of the material to be raised;
 
(ii) the weight of the wire rope; and 
 (iii)  the force due to acceleration of the material

Example 23.3 
A 6 ¥ 19 wire rope with ﬁ bre core 
and tensile designation of 1570 is used to raise the 
load of 20 kN as shown in Fig. 23.7. The nominal 
diameter of the wire rope is 12 mm and the sheave 
has 500 mm pitch diameter. Determine the expected 
life of the rope assuming 500 bends per week.

It is observed from Fig. 23.7 that each side of the

Example 23.4 
It is required to select a 6 ¥ 19 
wire rope with 1570 as tensile designation for a 
hoist on the basis of long life. The weight of the hoist 
along with the material is 5 kN. It is to be raised 
from a depth of 100 m. The maximum speed of 5 m/s 
is attained in 5 s. Determine the size of the wire rope 
and the sheave diameter for long life on the basis of 
the fatigue as failure criterion. What is the factor of 
safety of this wire rope under static conditions?
Solution
Given W = 5 kN h = 100 m v2 = 5 m/s
v1 = 0 t = 5 s For wire rope,
construction = 6 ¥ 19 tensile designation = 1570
Step I Total load on wire rope
The total force (P) acting on the wire rope consists 
of three factors—(i) the weight of the hoist; (ii) the 
weight of the wire rope; and (iii) the force due to 
acceleration. The weight of the hoist is given as

Referring to Table 23.4, the mass of the wire rope 
depends upon the nominal diameter (dr), which is 
unknown at this stage. As a trial value, the mass is 
assumed to be 40 kg per 100 m length. Since the 
material is to be raised from a depth of 100 m, 
the length of the wire rope is assumed as 100 m. 
Therefore, the weight of the wire rope will be,

23.4 ROPE SHEAVES AND DRUMS
There are three requirements for the design of rope 
sheaves and rope drums. They are as follows:
 
(i) They should have a proper size.
 
(ii) They should run freely on the axle.
 (iii) They should have grooves with proper 
dimensions.
Rope sheaves and rope drums should be as large 
as possible to obtain maximum rope life. However, 
their cost increases with the size. The centrifugal 
force also increases with the size, particularly in 
high speed applications. These limitations call for 
relatively small sheaves and drums with consequent 
sacriﬁ ce in the rope life. However, there is a 
minimum ratio of drum or sheave diameter to rope 
diameter, which should be considered in the design 
of rope drives. The values of this ratio for different 
applications and wire rope constructions are given 
in Table 23.9.

Wire rope sheaves are made of either cast iron 
or mild steel. Rope life depends upon contacting 
material of the groove on the sheave. It has been 
observed that ropes operating over steel sheaves 
wear faster than those used in conjunction with 
cast iron sheaves. If wear on a rope operating over 
a cast iron sheave is taken as unity then the wear 
with a steel sheave is approximately 1.1. Therefore, 
sheaves made of grey cast iron FG 200, are preferred 
over welded steel sheaves. Small sheaves are 
usually cast as one piece construction without ribs. 
Large sheaves are provided with ribs. The sheaves 
are always freely mounted on ﬁ xed axles. They are 
mounted either on rolling contact bearings or bronze 
bushings.
The proﬁ le of the groove in the sheave is shown 
in Fig. 23.8. The diameter of the groove should be 
always more than the rope diameter. If the groove 
radius (R) is too large, the rope will tend to ﬂ atten 
under load. On the other hand, too small a groove 
radius will cause rope distortion. As the rope is bent 
around the sheave, the strands and wires lie upon 
each other to adjust themselves to this curvature. 
When the rope is forced in an undersize groove, 
the strands and the wires bind against each other 
resulting in increased internal friction. It also hinders 
the readjustment of the rope under load and forces 
some of the wires and strands to carry more load 
than their share. Therefore, there are deteriorating 
effects of oversized and undersized grooves. The 
correct groove radius is given by,
Groove radius = 1.05 (nominal rope radius) 
Fig. 23.8 Sheave Groove
The depth and the ﬂ are of the groove should be 
such that the rope does not rub against the ﬂ ange of 
the sheave while entering or leaving the groove. The 
bottom of the groove should be a circular arc over 
an angle of 120°. The sides of the groove should 
be ﬂ ared with an included angle of 40° to 45°. The 
806 Design of Machine Elements
depth of the groove is usually taken as twice the 
nominal rope diameter.
There are two types of constructions for rope 
drums, namely, drums with helical grooves and 
plain cylindrical drums without grooves. In most 
hoisting installations, preference is given to grooved 
drums instead of plain drums. The machined 
grooves increase the bearing surface of the drum 
and prevent friction between adjacent turns of 
the rope. Consequently, this reduces wear of rope 
and increases life. The drums are usually made of 
grey cast iron of Grade FG 200. On rare occasions, 
welded steel drums are used. 
A grooved drum and the proﬁ le of the groove are 
illustrated in Fig. 23.9(a) and (b) respectively. The 
drum is provided with helical grooves so that the 
rope winds up uniformly on the drum. The radius of 
the helical groove should be selected so as to prevent 
jamming of the rope. Drums with one coiling rope 
have only one helical groove, i.e., right-hand helical 
groove. Drums designed for two rope members are 
provided with two helical grooves—right-hand and 
left-hand helical grooves. The pitch of the groove is 
given by,
 
t = dr + (2 to 3 mm)
Fig. 23.9 Rope Drum
The shell thickness of cast iron drum is given 
by,
 
t1 = 0.02 D + (6 to 10 mm)
where,
dr = nominal diameter of rope (mm)
D = drum diameter (mm)
The groove diameter is 1.5 to 3 mm more than 
the rope diameter.
23.5 BUCKLING OF COLUMNS
A column or strut is a slender machine component, 
which has considerable length in proportion to 
its width, depth or diameter. A column is also 
called a strut, pillar or stanchion. Piston rods in 
hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, push rods of valve 
mechanisms, power screws in jacks, and connecting 
rods are examples of columns.
When a short member is subjected to axial 
compressive force, as shown in Fig 23.10(a), it 
shortens according to Hooke’s law. As the load is 
gradually increased, the compression of the member 
increases. When the compressive stress reaches 
the elastic limit of the material, the failure occurs 
in the form of bulging. However, when the length 
of the component is large compared with the cross-
sectional dimensions, as shown in Fig. 23.10(b), the 
Fig. 23.10
component may fail by lateral buckling. Buckling 
indicates elastic instability. The load at which the 
buckling starts is called critical load, which is 
denoted by Pcr. When the axial load on the column 
reaches Pcr, there is sudden buckling and a relatively 
large lateral deﬂ ection occurs. Some of the rules of 
thumb for buckling of columns are as follows:
 
(i) A column made of a ductile material like 
steel and whose length is more than eight 
times of its least lateral dimension is likely to 
buckle and should be treated as a column.
 
(ii) A column made of a brittle material like cast 
iron and whose length is more than six times 
of its least lateral dimension is likely to 
buckle and should be treated as a column.
Miscellaneous Machine Elements 807
There is a basic difference between the lateral 
deﬂ ection of a beam and the buckling of columns. 
The lateral deﬂ ection of the beam is gradually 
increased as the lateral load is increased. In case of 
buckling, there is no such lateral deﬂ ection till the 
load reaches the critical load. At this point, there is 
sudden lateral deﬂ ection, which results in collapse of 
the column. The failure due to buckling is, therefore, 
sudden and total without any warning.
 An important parameter affecting the critical load 
is the slenderness ratio. It is deﬁ ned as,
 slenderness ratio = l
k  
     (23.5)
where,  
 l = length of the column (mm)
 k = least radius of gyration of the cross-section  
 
about its axis (mm)
The radius of gyration is given by,
 
k = 
I
A  
  (23.6)
where,
  I = least moment of inertia of the cross-section  
 
(mm4)
 A = area of the cross-section (mm2)
When the slenderness ratio is less than 30, there 
is no effect of buckling and such components are 
designed on the basis of compressive stresses. 
Columns, with slenderness ratio greater than 30, 
are designed on the basis of critical load. There are 
two terms, namely, short and long columns, that are 
frequently used in buckling analysis. The rules of 
thumb for deciding long and short columns are as 
follows:
 
(i) Cast iron columns with a slenderness ratio 
not greater than 80 and steel columns with 
a slenderness ratio not greater than 100, are 
considered short columns.
 
(ii) Long columns are those with slenderness 
ratio greater than 100 for ductile materials 
and greater than 80 for cast iron.
There are two methods to calculate the critical 
load—Euler’s equation and Johnson’s equation.

 (23.7)
where,
 Pcr  = critical load (N)
 n  = end ﬁ xity coefﬁ cient
 E  = modulus of elasticity (N/mm2)
 A = area of the cross-section (mm2)
The load carrying capacity of the column depends 
upon the condition of restraints at the two ends of the 
column. It is accounted by means of a dimensionless 
quantity called end ﬁ xity coefﬁ cient (n). The values 
of n are as follows:

The graph of unit load (Pcr/A) against slenderness 
ratio (l/k) is shown in Fig. 23.11. The following 
observations are made from Fig. 23.11.
Fig. 23.11 Variation of Unit Load Against Slenderness 
Ratio-Euler’s & Johnson’s Criteria
 
(i) When the slenderness ratio is 60, the unit 
load according to Euler’s equation is 568 
N/mm2, while the yield strength of the 
material is 380 N/mm2. Therefore, Euler’s 
equation is illogical in this range.
 
(ii) When the slenderness ratio is more than 150, 
Johnson’s equation gives negative values of 
unit load, which is illogical.
 (iii) The curves given by Euler’s and Johnson’s 
equations are tangential at the point P, where 
the unit load (Pcr/A) is equal to (Syt/2), i.e., 
190 N/mm2. The slenderness ratio at this 
point can be considered as the boundary line 
between short and long columns. 
 In design analysis, the question always arises 
as to whether one should use Euler’s equation or 
Johnson’s equation. From the above observations, 
it is concluded that Euler’s equation is suitable for 
long columns, while Johnson’s equation, for short 
columns. The boundary line between the two is 
deﬁ ned by equating the unit load (Pcr/A) to half the 
yield strength.

 (23.9)
The ratio (l/k) obtained by Eq. (23.9) is the critical 
slenderness ratio between long and short columns. 
When the actual slenderness ratio is less than the 
critical slenderness ratio, Johnson’s equation is used. 
When the actual slenderness ratio is more than the 
critical slenderness ratio, Euler’s equation should be 
used.
Example 23.5 
A 25 ¥ 50 mm bar of rectangular 
cross-section is made of plain carbon steel 40C8 
(Syt = 380 N/mm2 and E = 207 000 N/mm2). The 
length of the bar is 500 mm. The two ends of the bar 
are hinged and the factor of safety is 2.5. The bar is 
subjected to axial compressive force.
 
(i) Determine the slenderness ratio;
 
(ii) Which of the two equations—Euler’s or 
Johnson’s—will you apply to the bar?
 (iii) What is the safe compressive force for the 
bar?
Solution
Given For bar, cross-section = 25 ¥ 50 mm

Example 23.6 
A trunnion mounted hydraulic 
cylinder is shown in Fig. 23.12. The internal diameter 
of the cylinder is 75 mm and the maximum operating 
pressure in the cylinder is 25 N/mm2. The piston rod 
is made of steel 4OCr1 (Syt = 530 N/mm2 and E = 
207 000 N/mm2). For buckling considerations, the 
effective length of the piston rod is considered as the 
distance between the trunnion and the clevis-mount, 
when the piston rod is extended to its full working 
stroke and this distance is 1000 mm. Determine the 
diameter of the piston rod, if the factor of safety is 2.5.
Solution
Given For piston rod, l = 1000 mm (fs) = 2.5
Syt = 530 N/mm2 E = 207 000 N/mm2
For cylinder, D = 75 mm p = 25 N/mm2
Step I Estimation of critical load 
 
Although one end of the piston rod is ﬁ xed in the 
piston, considering the complete assembly between 
trunnion and clevis-mount, the end ﬁ xity coefﬁ cient 
is taken as one (both ends hinged). The maximum

In this example, the slenderness ratio (98.21) is 
greater than the boundary value of (87.8). Therefore 
the assembly is treated as a long column and Euler’s 
equation used in the ﬁ rst trial is justiﬁ ed.

Example 23.7 
A column of hollow rectangular 
cross-section and made of steel plates is shown in 
Fig. 23.13. The thickness of the section is 2.5 mm 
throughout. The plate material is steel 30C8 (Syt = 
400 N/mm2 and E = 207 000 N/mm2). The end ﬁ xity 
coefﬁ cients can be taken as 1.5 and 1 for bending 
about long and short axes respectively. The effective 
length of the column is 1 m. Determine the load 
capacity of the column from buckling consideration.

of the screw is ﬁ xed in the nut and the other end 
supports a load of 20 kN. The length of the screw

Assuming a factor of safety of 2.5, determine the

Problems for Practice
 23.1 6 ¥ 19 wire ropes with ﬁ bre core and nominal 
diameter of 10 mm are used for a hoist. The 
tensile designation of wires is 1770. The 
mass of the wire rope is 34.6 kg per l00 m 
length, while the breaking load is 54 kN. The 
weight of the hoist along with the material 
is 10 kN, which is raised through a distance 
of 3 m. The maximum acceleration during 
the operation is limited to 1 m/s2. Neglecting 
bending stresses and assuming a preliminary 
factor of safety of 10, determine the required 
number of wire ropes.
[3]
 23.2 Assume the data of Example 23.1 and 
determine the true factor of safety taking 
into account the bending stresses. The sheave 
diameter is 450 mm and there are three wire 
ropes.
[6.48]
 23.3 A 6 ¥ 19 wire rope with ﬁ bre core, is used to 
raise a load. The tensile designation of wires 
Miscellaneous Machine Elements 813
is 1770. The nominal diameter of the wire 
rope and the sheave diameter are 10 and 450 
mm respectively. Assuming long life (p/Sut = 
0.0015) on the basis of fatigue consideration, 
determine the maximum load that the wire 
rope can carry.

 23.4 It is required to design the piston rod of a steam 
engine on the basis of buckling strength. The 
internal diameter of the cylinder is 200 mm, 
while the operating steam pressure is limited 
to 1 N/mm2. The length of the piston rod is
1 m. One end of the piston rod is ﬁ xed in the 
piston, while the other can be considered as 
hinged. The piston rod is made of steel 40C8 
(Syt = 380 N/mm2 and E = 207 000 N/mm2). 
The factor of safety is 5. Neglecting inertia 
forces, determine the diameter of the piston 
rod.

 23.5 In a screw jack, one end of the screw is ﬁ xed 
in the nut and the other end supports a load 
of 10 kN. The length of the screw between 
the nut and the free end is 500 mm, when 
the load is completely raised. The screw is 
made of steel 40C8 (Syt = 380 N/mm2 and E = 
207 000 N/mm2). The nominal diameter and 
the pitch of the screw are 30 mm and 6 mm 
respectively. The screw has square threads. 
Determine the factor of safety from buckling 
considerations.

N/mm2 and E = 207 000 N/mm2). Assuming 
a factor of safety of 3.5, determine the safe 
axial force that the link can carry without 
buckling.

Statistical
Considerations

Chapter 24
24.1 FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
Statistics deals with drawing conclusions from 
a given or observed data. Statistical techniques 
are used for collection, processing, analysis and 
interpretation of numerical data. On the basis of 
statistical analysis, valid conclusions are drawn and 
reasonable decisions are taken. Statistics enables 
the engineers to understand the phenomena of 
variations and how to effectively predict and control 
them. Statistics has made valuable contributions in 
the areas of product design and manufacture and 
effective use of material and labour.
The basic data consists of observations, 
such as the diameters of shafts manufactured in 
one shift. In this case, the group of all shafts is 
called ‘population’. When the group is large, it 
is not possible to take observations of the entire 
population. In such cases, only a small portion of 
the population is examined and this portion is called 
a ‘sample’. Population is deﬁ ned as a collection of 
all elements we are studying and about which we 
are trying to draw conclusions. On the other hand, 
a sample is deﬁ ned as a collection of some, but not 
all, of the elements of the population. A sample 
is a part of the population but the converse is not 
true. It is easier to study a sample than studying the 
whole population. It costs less and takes less time. 
A representative sample has the characteristics of 
the population in the same proportions, as they are 
included in the entire population. Therefore, many 
times a sample is analysed instead of the entire 
population.
Let us consider an example of 100 shafts 
of hydrodynamic bearing, with recommended 
tolerance of 40e7. The shafts are manufactured 
on lathe and ﬁ nished on grinding machine. Their 
diameters are measured by micrometer and the 
readings are tabulated in Table 24.1. The readings 
in Table 24.1 are called ‘raw data’. A data is 
deﬁ ned as the collection of numbers belonging to 
observations of one or more variables. In this case, 
the diameter of shaft is a variable and one hundred 
numerical readings taken by micrometer are a data. 
Raw data is a data before it is arranged or analysed 
by any statistical method. Raw data does not show 
any pattern or trend of population and does not lead 
to any conclusions. In this chapter, the objective of 
statistical techniques is to rearrange and present the 
data in a useful way so that the decisions can be 
taken. 
Let us rearrange the data given in Table 24.1 on 
the basis of diameter of shaft against the number 
of shafts. As shown in Table 24.2, a particular 
diameter such as 39.926 mm is written in the ﬁ rst 
column and each shaft with this diameter is shown 
by a mark X against it. Finally, the number of marks 
are counted and written in the last column. For 
example, the total number of shafts with a diameter 
of 39.940 mm is 8. The data in Table 24.2 is further 
Statistical Considerations in Design 815
rearranged in the form of frequency distribution 
table and presented in Table 24.3. Frequency 
distribution is deﬁ ned as an organised display of 
data that shows the number of observations that 
fall into different classes.

It is observed from Table 24.3 that the ﬁ rst 
‘class’ consists of shafts with diameters ranging 
from 39.926 mm to 39.930 mm. The number of 
observations belonging to each class is called ‘class 
frequency’. Thus, the class frequency of the ﬁ rst 
class is 5. The range 39.926 to 39.930 mm, which 
deﬁ nes the class, is called the ‘class interval’ and the 
limits 39.926 mm and 39.930 mm are called lower 
and upper class limits. The difference between the 
limits, i.e., (39.930 – 39.925) = 0.005 mm, is called 
‘class width’. In Table 24.3, the classes are equal, 
that is, the width of the interval from beginning of 
one class to the beginning of the next class is same 
for every class. Equal classes are always preferred 
in statistical analysis. When classes are unequal, the 
distribution is more difﬁ cult to interpret.
Table 24.2 (Contd)

816 Design of Machine Elements
There are two methods of representing the 
frequency distribution namely, histogram and 
frequency polygon as shown in Fig. 24.1. The 
histogram consists of a set of rectangles. The base 
of the rectangle on the x-axis is equal to the class 
width, and the area of the rectangle is proportional 
to the class frequency. When the class widths are of

equal size, the heights of rectangles are proportional 
to the class frequencies. The frequency polygon is a 
line graph of class frequency plotted against class 
marks or midpoints of class intervals. When a large 
number of observations are taken and very small 
class widths are selected, the frequency polygon 
becomes an approximate curve. One such frequency 
curve, which is widely used in the statistical analysis, 
is the normal curve as shown in Fig. 24.2.

24.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF
 
FREQUENCY CURVES
It is observed from the frequency polygon and 
normal curve illustrated in Fig. 24.1 and Fig. 
24.2, that most of the observations in engineering 
applications present a well behaved picture, which 
rises and falls smoothly. There is always a central 
tendency, where most of the observations cluster. 
Central tendency is the middle point of distribution. 
It is sometimes, referred as the ‘measure of 
location’. In Fig. 24.3, the central location of 
curve-2 lies to the right of those of curve-1 and 
curve-3. It is also observed that the central location

of curve-1 is equal to that of curve-3. There are 
certain observations that tend to spread about an 
average value called ‘variation’ or ‘dispersion’ of 
a population. Dispersion is deﬁ ned as the spread 
of the data in a distribution, that is, the extent to 
which the observations are scattered. In Fig. 24.4, 
curve-1 has a wider spread or dispersion than 
curve-2. The central tendency and dispersion are 
the two important characteristics of frequency 
distribution.

There are two more characteristics of population, 
namely, skewness and kurtosis as shown in 
Fig. 24.5 and Fig. 24.6 respectively. Curves 
representing data in statistical analysis are of two 
types—symmetrical and skewed. The normal 
curve illustrated in Fig. 24.2 is an example of a 
symmetrical curve. It rises and falls smoothly with 
a bell shape. A symmetrical curve is widely used in 
statistical analysis of tolerances. Curves 1 and 2 in 
Statistical Considerations in Design 817
Fig. 24.5 are skewed. In skewed curves, the values 
in frequency distribution are concentrated at either 
the low end or the high end of the measuring scale 
on the horizontal axis. The values are not equally 
distributed. Curve-1 is skewed to the right because 
it tails off toward the high end of the scale. It is also 
called a positively skewed curve. Curve-2 is skewed

to the left because it tails off toward the low end of 
the scale. It is called a negatively skewed curve. The 
Weibull distribution used in reliability analysis of 
rolling contact bearing is an example of a skewed 
curve. Kurtosis is the measure of sharp peaks. In 
Fig. 24.6, curves 1 and 2 differ in the shape of their 
peaks. Curve-2 has a sharper peak than curve-1. 
They have the same central tendency and both are 
symmetrical. However, they have different degrees 
of kurtosis. In this chapter, we will restrict the 
analysis to normal curves.

24.3 MEASURES OF CENTRAL
 
TENDENCY AND DISPERSION
 There are different measures of central tendency, 
such as the mean, the median or the mode. The 
most popular unit to measure the central tendency 
is the arithmetic mean denoted by the letter µ. 
Suppose the population consists of N observations 
X1, X2,…, XN. The mean is given by

If observations X1, X2, …, Xk occur f1, f2, …, fk 
times respectively (i.e., occur with frequencies f1, 
f2, …, fk), the arithmetic mean is given by

 The dispersion is measured in number of units 
like the range, the mean deviation or the standard 
deviation. The most popular unit for dispersion is 
the standard deviation denoted by the letter ˆs . 
The standard deviation is deﬁ ned as the root mean 
square deviation from the mean.

When observations belong to a sample of a 
population, it has been observed that by replacing N 
by (N – 1) in the denominator of Eq. 24.5, a better 
estimate of the standard deviation is obtained. For 
large values of N (N > 30), there is practically 
no difference between these two expressions.

24.4 PROBABILITY
 Probability is deﬁ ned as the chance or likelihood 
that a particular event will occur. In mathematical 
terms, it is a number that varies from 0 to 1. The 
probability is 0 when the event is impossible to 
occur. The probability is 1 when the event is certain 
to occur. If there are equal chances that the event 
will occur or will not occur, the probability is 0.5. 
The concept of probability is a part of our general 
knowledge. If asked what is the probability that 
a tossed coin will come up with a head, most of 
the people will answer ‘one half’. Or, take a six-
sided cube with numbers 1 to 6 on its faces; the 
probability that it will come up with the number 5 
is one-sixth.
 In more precise terms, the probability is deﬁ ned 
as a number p, which varies from 0 to 1 and which 
indicates the chance that a particular event E will 
occur, given that it can happen f ways out of n 
equally likely ways. Therefore,
 
 
 p

Suppose, we toss a coin twenty times (n = 20), 
and that we get twelve heads (f = 12). Then the 
probability of getting heads is given by,

or
 
Although the answer is 0.6, if the coin is tossed 
again and again for a large number of times, the 
probability that it will come up with heads is 0.5.
 If the event does not occur, it is called ‘not E’ 
and written as E. The probability that the event 
will not occur is written as P( )E . Therefore,
 
 
 q = P( )E  = 1 – P(E) 
(24.9)
where q is the probability of non occurrence.
Also,  
  p + q  = 1 
(24.10)
Example 24.2 Five bolts with internal cracks 
are accidentally  mixed with 95 bolts without any 
defects. What is the probability that the assembly 
shop will use a defective bolt? Also, ﬁ nd out the 
possibility of not using the defective bolts.
Solution
 Given Number of bolts without defect = 95
 
Number of bolts with defect = 5
Step I Probability of using defective bolts
In this example, the event (E) is to use a defective 
bolt. Out of 100 bolts, ﬁ ve are defective. Therefore, 
the event can happen in ﬁ ve (f = 5) ways out of one 
hundred (n = 100) equally likely ways.

Step II Probability of not using defective bolts
The probability of not event ( )E , namely, not using 
the defective bolt, is given by,
 
q = P( )E  = 1 – p = 1 – 0.05 = 0.95 
Also, p + q = 0.05 + 0.95 = 1
The physical signiﬁ cance of the number 1 is that 
there is a certainty of using either a defective or 
non-defective bolt in the assembly shop.
24.5 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
 There is an important concept of random variables 
in statistical considerations. In Example 24.1, we 
have considered one hundred test specimens made 
of grey cast iron FG 300 which are tested on a 
universal testing machine to ﬁ nd out the ultimate 
tensile strength of the material. We get different 
values of UTS in each test. There are a number 
of factors that vary from test to test. There are 
variations in size of the test specimen because 
of tolerances. The chemical composition of each 
specimen also varies, although within limits. The 
testing on a universal testing machine is called 
‘random experiment’ because the specimens are 
selected at random. The values of UTS obtained 
in such testing are called ‘random variables’. A 
random variable is deﬁ ned as a variable that takes 
different values in random experiments. Dimensions 
of component, weight, strength, forces acting on 
component, stress or properties of materials are 
all random variables. In other words, a random 
variable is a variable whose values depend upon 
the outcome of a random experiment.
820 Design of Machine Elements
 We will conduct a random experiment to explain 
the above concept. There are two six-sided cubes 
with numbers 1 to 6 marked on their surfaces. 
Every time, the two cubes are tossed and the sum of 
numbers that will appear is denoted as x. Each cube 
can display any number from 1 to 6. It depends 
upon the outcome of tossing. Therefore, tossing 
the two cubes is a ‘random experiment’. The 
variable x, which is the addition of two numbers, 
is a ‘random variable’. Figure 24.7 shows the all-
possible outcomes of these experiments. There 
are a total of 36 possible outcomes. The random 
variable x has a speciﬁ c value for each possible 
outcome. For example, in the ﬁ rst event shown 
at the ﬁ rst row and ﬁ rst column, the variable x = 
1 + 1 = 2. It is seen from Fig. 24.7, that x is 2 in 
only one out of 36 likely outcomes. Therefore, the

probability of getting x = 2 is 1 out of 36 or 1/36. 
The values of x for each of the remaining outcomes 
and their probabilities are calculated in a similar 
manner. The results are given in Table 24.4 and 
shown schematically in Fig. 24.8.

Table 24.4 that gives a list of all possible 
values of a random variable and the corresponding 
probabilities is called a probability distribution 
table. Sometimes, the designer is interested in 
ﬁ nding out the probability that x is less than a 
particular value. For example, in Example 24.1, 
the designer may be interested in ﬁ nding out 
the probability that the ultimate tensile strength 
is less than 300 N/mm2. This is because he has 
assumed 300 N/mm2 as UTS for calculating the 
dimensions of the cast iron component. Referring 
to Table 24.4, the probability that x is less than 
xi  is obtained by adding  the probabilities of all 
values of x up to and including xi. For example, 
the probability that x is less than or equal to 4 is 
given by,

Table 24.5 shows the values calculated by the 
above method. The probability that x is less than xi, 
is called cumulative probability and is denoted by 
the cumulative probability function F(x). Table 24.5 
is called the cumulative probability distribution 
table. This distribution is also shown in Fig. 24.9.

 24.6 NORMAL CURVE
In statistical analysis, the most popular probability 
distribution curve is the normal curve as shown 
in Fig. 24.10. The distribution is called normal 
or Gaussian. The equation of the normal curve in 
terms of the standard variable Z is given by
 
f Z

(24.11)
An important characteristic of the normal curve 
is that the total area below the curve from Z = 
–∞  to  Z = +∞ is one or unity. The areas included 
between different values of Z are as follows:

Statistical Considerations in Design 823
24.7 POPULATION COMBINATIONS
There are many problems in machine design where 
it is required to combine two or more populations in 
a speciﬁ c manner to obtain the resultant population. 
As an example, there are two populations in journal 
bearing—a population consisting of inner diameter 
of bearings and a population consisting of outer 
diameter of shafts. Statistically, both populations 
are random variables. The system is interchangeable 
and a shaft should match with any bearing selected 
at random. Further, they are ﬁ tted in such a way 
that there is a proper clearance between the bearing 
and the shaft. In this case, subtracting the shaft-
population from the bearing-population can form 
a third population consisting of clearances. The 
clearance population is a random variable.  
Consider a simple case of three bearings 
with diameters D1, D2 and D3 and two shafts of 
diameters d1 and d2. The means of populations for 
bearing and shaft are given by,

Since there are six possible combinations of 
the shaft and bearing, the population of clearance 
consists of the following six elements:
C1  =  D1 –  d1
C2  =  D1  –  d2
C3  =  D2  –  d1
C4  =  D2  –  d2
C5  =  D3  –  d1
C6  =  D3  –  d2

From (a), (b) and (c),
µC = µD – µd
Therefore, when two populations are subtracted, 
the mean of the resultant population is obtained 
by a subtraction of their individual means. In 
general, when a population Y is subtracted from a 
population X, the mean of the resultant population 
is given by
 
 
µ = µX – µY 
(24.12)
Similarly, it can be proved that when two 
populations are added, the mean of the resultant 
population is obtained by an addition of their 
individual means. Or,
 
 
µ = µX + µY 
(24.13)
The standard deviations for populations of 
bearing and shaft are given by

 Therefore, the standard deviation follows

In this article, we have considered only addition 
and subtraction of two populations. Sometimes, it 
is required to divide or multiply one population by 
another. In some cases, it is required to square a 
population or to take an inverse of the population. 
Table 24.7 shows all such combinations and 
how to obtain mean and standard deviation of 
combinations. The values given in this table are 
approximate and standard textbooks in statistics 
can be referred for more exhaustive treatment. In

In statistical analysis, many times it is 
important to know the distribution of the resultant 
population obtained by combination of two or 
more populations. A designer cannot assume every 
resulting population to be a normally distributed 
random variable. For example, the population 
Statistical Considerations in Design 825
of stress is created by dividing the population of 
force by the population of area. The population of 
force as well as the population of area is normally 
distributed random variable. In order to ﬁ nd out 
the probability of a particular limiting value for 
stress, the designer must be sure that the resulting 
population of stress is a normally distributed 
random variable. Merely creating the resultant 
population and calculating values of mean and 
standard variable from Table 24.7 will not predict 
correct results. The guidelines for such problems 
are as follows:
 
(i) When two normally distributed random 
variables are added, the resulting population 
is also normally distributed.
 (ii) When two normally distributed random 
variables are subtracted, the resulting 
population is also normally distributed.
 (iii) When two normally distributed random 
variables are multiplied, the resulting 
population has an approximately normal 
distribution.
 (iv) When two normally distributed random 
variables 
are 
divided, 
the 
resulting 
population does not have a strictly normal 
distribution. However, it may be assumed as 
approximately normal distribution.
Books in statistical analysis give various 
conditions as to where one can assume normal 
distribution in case of multiplication and division of 
two variables. However, such exhaustive treatment 
is avoided in this chapter.
24.8  DESIGN AND NATURAL 
 
TOLERANCES
The variations in the dimensions of a component 
occur due to two reasons—ﬁ rst, because of a 
large number of chance causes and, second, due 
to assignable causes. The variations due to chance 
causes occur at random. They are the characteristics 
of the manufacturing method and measurement 
technique. The variations due to assignable causes 
can be located and corrected. When they are 
corrected, the system is said to be under ‘statistical 
control’.
 In 
a 
statistically 
controlled 
system, 
the 
dimensions of the component are normally 
distributed with a particular value of standard 
deviation. The natural tolerance is deﬁ ned as 
the actual capabilities of the process, and can be 
considered as limits within which all but a given 
allowable fraction of items will fall. In general, 
the natural tolerance of a process is the spread of 
the normal curve that includes 99.73% of the total 
population.
 Referring to the normal curve, shown in 
Fig. 24.10, the values of the standard variables Z1 
and Z2 corresponding to this population are  –3 and  
+3.

Therefore, the natural tolerances are ± 3 ( ˆs). 
On the contrary, the design tolerances are 
speciﬁ cation limits, set somewhat arbitrarily by 
the designer from considerations of the proper 
matching of the two components and functioning 
of the assembly. The design tolerances can be 
achieved only when the manufacturing process is 
so selected that the natural tolerances are within 
the design tolerances. The percentage of rejected 
components depends upon the relationship between 
these two tolerances. Based on this relationship, the 
following observations are made:
 
(i) When the design tolerance is less than 
(± 3 ˆs), the percentage of rejected compo-
nents is inevitable.
 (ii) When the design tolerance is equal to (± 3 ˆs ), 
there is virtually no rejection provided that 
the manufacturing process is centred. For 
an off-centre process, some components are 
rejected.
 (iii) When the design tolerance is slightly greater 
than (± 3 ˆs ), there is no rejection even if the 
manufacturing process is slightly off-centre.
It is necessary for the designer to select a 
manufacturing process for a component in such 
826 Design of Machine Elements
a way that the natural tolerance of the process is 
slightly less than design tolerance. The design 
tolerance should be about (± 4 ˆs ).
Example 24.3 
It has been observed from a 
sample of 200 bearing bushes that the internal 
diameters are normally distributed with a mean 
of 30.010 mm and a standard deviation of 0.008 
mm. The upper and lower limits for the internal 
diameter, as speciﬁ ed by the designer, are 30.02 and 
30.00 mm respectively. Calculate the percentage of 
rejected bushes.
Solution
Given m = 30.010 mm 
ˆs  = 0.008 mm
 
X1 = 30.02 mm X2 = 30.00 mm

 Shaded area = 2 (area between Z = 0 and Z = 1.25)

Fig. 24.12 
Step III Percentage of rejected bushes 
% of rejected bushes = (1 – 0.7888) ¥ 100 = 21.12%
Example 24.4 The tolerance speciﬁ ed by the 
designer for the diameters of a transmission shaft 
is 25.000 ± 0.025 mm. The shafts are machined on 
three different machines. It was observed from the 
sample of shafts that the diameters are normally 
distributed with a standard deviation of 0.015 
mm for each of the three machines. However, the 
mean diameter of shafts fabricated on the three 
machines is found to be 24.99, 25.00 and 25.01 mm 
respectively. Determine the percentage of rejected 
shafts in each case and comment on the result.
Solution
Given 
ˆs  = 0.015 mm X1 = 25.000 – 0.025 mm 
X2 = 25.000 + 0.025 mm m1 = 24.99 mm
m2 = 25 mm m3 = 25.01 mm
Step I Percentage of rejected shafts in each machine
The lower and upper limits speciﬁ ed by the 
designer are,
 
X1 = 25.000 – 0.025 = 24.975 mm 
 
X2 = 25.000 + 0.025 = 25.025 mm

Step II Comments on result 
The above data is illustrated in Fig. 24.13. It is 
observed from the ﬁ gure that in case of machines 
A or C, the process is not centred, which results 
in a large percentage of rejection. With the same 
magnitude of tolerance, the percentage of rejection 
is small in case of the machine B, because the 
process is centred.

Example 24.5 
The recommended class of 
transition ﬁ t between the recess and the spigot of 
a rigid coupling is 60H6-j5. Assuming that the 
dimensions of the two components are normally 
distributed and that the speciﬁ ed tolerance is equal 
to the natural tolerance, determine the probability 
of interference ﬁ t between the two components.
Solution
Given Class of ﬁ t = 60H6-j5
There are two populations—population of recess 
dimension denoted by the letter R and that of spigot 
dimension denoted by the letter S.
Step I Population of recess (R)
The limiting dimensions for recess 60H6 are (Table 
3.2)
60.019 mm
60.000
   or    60.0095 ± 0.0095 mm

Step III Population of interference (I)
The population for interference is denoted by the

mI = mS – mR = 59.9995 – 60.0095  =  – 0.01 mm

the value of I will be negative, giving a clearance 
ﬁ t. The probability of interference ﬁ t is therefore 
given by the area below the normal curve from Z  = 
2.60 to Z  =  +∞. From Table 24.6, the area below 
the normal curve from Z  = 0 to Z  = 2.60 is 0.4953. 
Therefore, the probability of interference ﬁ t is 
(0.5 – 0.4953) ¥ 100 or 0.47%.
Example 24.6 The recommended class of ﬁ t for 
the journal and the bush of a hydrodynamic bearing 
is 40H6-e7. The dimensions of the journal and 
the bush are normally distributed and the natural 
tolerance is equal to the design tolerance. From the 
considerations of hydrodynamic action and bearing 
stability, the maximum and minimum clearances 
are limited to 0.08 and 0.06 mm respectively. 
Determine the percentage of rejected assemblies.
Solution
 Given Class of ﬁ t = 40H6-e7
 
X1 = 0.08 mm X2 = 0.06 mm
There are two populations—population of 
the bushes denoted by the letter B and that of the 
journals denoted by the letter J.

Therefore, the percentage of rejected assemblies is 
[1 – (0.4726 + 0.4830)] ¥ 100 or 4.44%.

A, B and C is shown in Fig. 24.15. The dimensions

When Z is less than 1.73, I is negative, giving

curve from Z = 0 to Z = + 1.73 is 0.4582. Therefore, 
the percentage of interference assemblies is 
(0.5 – 0.4582) ¥ 100 or 4.18%.
24.9 RELIABILITY
A product is said to be reliable when it performs its 
intended function satisfactorily throughout its life. 
A domestic refrigerator, which works continuously 
year after year without any breakdown, is an 
example of a reliable product. In the past, engineers 
recognised the need of designing products for 
long life. In those days, reliability was mainly 
achieved through over design. Reliable products 
were dependable. Steam locomotives, turbines 
and power presses were all designed for trouble 
free long life. However, such products were few 
and comparatively simple. Modern products are 
complex and many factors affect their performance. 
The emphasis is on lightweight construction. These 
products work under severe working conditions 
than in the past. The customers expect much more 
reliability. All these factors have increased the 
importance of reliability in engineering design.
According to the International Standards 
Organization, reliability is deﬁ ned as the ability 
of an item to perform a required function under 
stated conditions for a stated period of time. 
In engineering design, reliability is expressed 
quantitatively such as 0.9 or 90%. In such cases, 
reliability is deﬁ ned, as the probability that a 
product will perform the required function under 
stated conditions for a stated period of time. 
This deﬁ nition of reliability contains four basic 
elements. They are as follows:
 
(i) The reliability of the product is expressed as 
a probability.
 (ii) The product is required to perform its 
intended function.
 (iii) The period during which the product has to 
perform the function is speciﬁ ed. 
 (iv) The operating conditions under which the 
product has to function are speciﬁ ed. 
For example, all the manufacturers of rolling 
contact bearing prescribe a reliability of 90% 
for their bearings. Let us consider a particular 
application, where a ball bearing is subjected to a 
radical load of 5 kN, while the expected life is 8000 
hours. The shaft rotates at a speed of 1450 rpm. The 
designer in this case has calculated the required 
830 Design of Machine Elements
dynamic load carrying capacity and selected the 
bearing from the manufacturers’ catalogue on the 
basis of this capacity. Let us consider the four basic 
elements in the deﬁ nition of reliability with respect 
to this application.
 
(i) The reliability of the ball bearing is 90%. It 
indicates that if a large number of bearings 
are purchased and mounted in this type 
of application, the manufacturer gives a 
guarantee that 90% of the bearings will 
reach or exceed the life of 8000 h at 1450 
rpm before fatigue failure. The remaining 
10% of the bearings may or may not reach 
the target life. Also, the manufacturer does 
not give a guarantee that a particular bearing 
will work satisfactorily for 8000 h at 1450 
rpm. In other words, the chances are that 9 
out of 10 bearings will reach or exceed the 
expected life.
 (ii) The performance of the product is the second 
element in the deﬁ nition of the reliability. A 
ball bearing is intended to support the shaft, 
to ensure its free rotation and to transmit the 
load from the shaft to the housing. In the 
above application, the bearing is required to 
transmit a load of 5 kN.
 (iii) The period during which the product has 
to perform its function is the third element 
in the deﬁ nition of reliability. Reliability 
must be identiﬁ ed for a stated period of 
time. In the above example, the ball bearing 
is required to support the rotating shaft 
and transmit a force of 5 kN for 8000 h of 
operation of 1450 rpm. 
 (iv) The fourth signiﬁ cant element in the 
deﬁ nition 
of 
reliability 
is 
operating 
conditions. The ball bearings operate under 
the following conditions: 
 
(a) The ball bearings are lubricated and the 
lubricant is periodically replaced.
 
(b) The ball bearings are protected from dust 
particles or moisture by means of oil 
seals.
 
(c) For every ball bearing; the manufacturer 
prescribes a limiting speed for the shaft, 
which is not exceeded.
 
(d) The journal and housing diameters are 
provided tolerances as per manufacturer’s 
speciﬁ cations. 
The operating conditions establish the factors 
that affect the life and reliability of the product.
Product reliability and product quality are 
closely related to each other. In fact, many times 
reliability is described as quality maintained 
during the useful life of the product. Some authors 
deﬁ ne reliability as a quality over a period of time. 
However, a product of high quality may not be a 
product with high reliability. A product may pass 
through all tests in the quality control department 
and yet it may fail when put into service due to 
adverse interaction between components. Even a 
high quality ball bearing will fail prematurely when 
mounted in an improper way. Quality is a special 
case of reliability. It is the state of reliability at the 
beginning of operation or at zero time.
24.10 PROBABILISTIC APPROACH
 
TO DESIGN     
Traditionally, design engineers have used factor of 
safety to ensure against uncertainty in magnitude 
of external forces acting on the component, 
variations in properties of materials like ultimate 
tensile strength or yield strength and variations 
in dimensions of the component due to imperfect 
workmanship. However, it is not possible to 
determine reliability using the concept of factor 
of safety. Since reliability is a design parameter, 
it should be incorporated in the product at the 
design stage. The factor of safety does not address 
reliability. Probabilistic approach is a technique 
to design the component for a given magnitude 
of reliability. In this approach, the following 
assumptions are made:
 
(i) The ultimate tensile strength or yield strength 
is not constant but subjected to statistical 
variation. The population of strength; 
denoted by S is under statistical control. It is 
normally distributed with a mean of mS and 
standard deviation ˆ S
s .
 (ii) The stress induced in the component is not 
constant but subjected to statistical variation. 
Statistical Considerations in Design 831
The population of stress, denoted by s, is 
normally distributed with a mean of ms  and 
standard deviation of ˆs
s .
Figure 24.16 shows the normal distribution of 
these two populations. It is clear that the mean of 
strength population is more than the mean of the 
stress population. However, there is an overlapping 
area between these two curves. The forward tail 
of stress distribution is overlapping the rear tail 
of the strength population. This overlapping area 
represents the region of unreliability. Some failures 
may occur in this region.
Fig. 24.16 Normal Distribution of Strength and Stress 
Populations
 A third population of the margin of safety is 
formed by subtracting the population of stress from 
the population of the strength. The population of 
margin of safety is denoted by m. From Eq. 24.12 
and 24.14,
 
 
mm = mS – ms

Safety
Refer back to Fig. 24.16, where overlapping area 
between the strength and stress curves indicates the 
region of unreliability. With reference to this ﬁ gure, 
the following four basic ways to increase reliability 
can be suggested:
 
(i) Increase the mean of strength population 
(ms) by using a better quality material for the 
component:
 (ii) Decrease the mean of stress population (ms ) 
by increasing the size of the component.
 (iii)  Decrease the standard deviation

of 
stress

 (iv)  Decrease the standard deviation

 of 
strength population by controlling the quality 
of incoming materials.
All methods increase the cost of the component. 
Reliability is achieved by increasing the cost of the 
component. Therefore, high reliability cannot be 
criterion in all applications.
Example 24.8 A tension rod is subjected to axial 
stress within elastic limit. According to Hooke’s 
law,
s = Ee
It has been observed that the strain (e) in the 
tension rod is a normally distributed variable with 
a mean of 0.001 mm/mm and a standard deviation 
of 0.000 07 mm/mm. The modulus of elasticity (E)

and a standard deviation of 15.69 N/mm2. We can 
predict the mean and the standard deviation of 
stress population. However, stress population is not 
exactly a normally distributed random variable.

Step V Comments on analysis 
The bending stress population has a mean of 142.6

We can predict the mean and standard deviation of 
this population. However, the population is not a 
normally distributed random variable.
Example 24.11 
The diametral tolerance for 
patented and cold drawn steel wire (Grade-2) used 
to make cold formed springs, as recommended in 
IS 4454-Part 1 is as follows:
Nominal Diameter (mm)
Tolerance (mm) 
6 – 7.5 
± 0.045  
8 –10 
± 0.050 
A 6.5 mm diameter wire is used to make a helical 
spring, in which the wire is subjected to torsional 
moment (Mt) of 10 N-m. The natural tolerance is 
equal to diametral tolerances. Neglect the Wahl 
factor and assume all other factors including 
torsional moment as constant. Determine the 
mean and standard deviation of the population of 
torsional shear stress.

Step IV Comments on analysis 
The torsional shear stress population has a mean 
of 185.53 N/mm2 and a standard deviation of 1.28 
N/mm2. We can predict the mean and standard 
deviation of this population. However, the 
population is not normally distributed.
Example 
24.12 A 
particular 
type 
of 
rollingcontact bearing has a normally distributed 
time to failure, with a mean of 10 000 hours and 
a standard deviation of 750 h. If there are 100 
such bearings ﬁ tted at a time, how many may be 
expected to fail within the ﬁ rst 11 000 h?

or 0.90871. 
Therefore, 90.87% bearings may fail within the 
ﬁ rst 11 000 h.

Example 24.13 The life of a ball bearing is a

The manufacturer of the bearings wants to give a

What should be the rated life?
Solution
Given m = 10 000 h

Step I Standard variable Z0 for 90 % reliability
The probability of survival of the bearings or 
reliability is 90% or 0.9. As shown in Fig. 24.19, 
the shaded area below the normal curve from 
Z = Z0 to Z = + • should be 0.9. The area below 
the normal curve from Z = 0 to Z = + • is 0.5. 
Therefore, the area below the normal curve from Z 
= 0 to Z = –Z0 should be 0.4. From Table 24.6, the 
corresponding value of Z0 is approximately 1.28. 
Therefore, 
Z0 = –1.28

specimens made of grey cast iron of grade FG300.

the curve from Z = 0 to Z = + 1. From Table 24.6, 
the area below normal curve from Z = 0 to Z = 1 
is 0.3413. Also, the area below normal curve from

As shown in Fig. 24.20(b), the area below the 
normal curve from Z1 = –1 to Z2 = +2 indicates the 
probability of specimens having UTS between 275 
and 350 N/mm2. From Table 24.6, the area below 
normal curve from Z = 0 to Z = +2 is 0.4772. 
Shaded area in Fig. 24.20(b) = 0.3413 + 0.4772

Therefore, 81.85% of specimens will have UTS 
between 275 to 350 N/mm2.

at random will be more than 50 kN?

As shown in Fig. 24.21(a), half the area of the curve 
is located on either side of the mean load of 50 kN. 
The area below the normal curve from Z = 0 to Z 
= +• indicates the probability that the load will be 
more than 50 kN. This area is 0.5. Therefore, we can 
conclude that the probability of a randomly selected

Statistical Considerations in Design 837
As shown in Fig. 24.22, the component will 
be unreliable for Z = – • to Z = Z0 or – 2.39. The 
reliability of the component is the area below the 
normal curve from Z = –2.39 to Z = + •. From 
Table 24.6, area below normal curve from Z = 0 
to Z = 2.39 is 0.4916. Total area below the normal 
curve from Z = –2.39 to Z = +• is (0.4916 + 0.5) or 
0.9916. Therefore, reliability used in designing the

subjected to a normally distributed force with a 
mean of 1000 N and a standard deviation of 200 
N. The designer has used a factor of safety of 1.5 
based on mean values. However due to variations 
in dimensions, the strength of the component is 
normally distributed with a mean of 1500 N and a 
standard deviation of 150 N. 
 
(i) What percentage of failure would be 
expected? 
 (ii) It is required to reduce the standard 
deviation of part strength by better quality 
control in order to achieve a failure rate 
of only 1%. What should be the standard 
deviation of the strength assuming other 
factors without any change?

of the component by using better material in

below the normal curve from Z = –2 to Z = –• is

25.1 INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
An Internal Combustion engine (IC engine) is an 
engine in which the combustion of fuel, such as petrol 
or diesel, takes place inside the engine cylinder. 
In petrol engine, air and petrol is mixed in correct 
proportion in the carburetter and then passed into 
the cylinder. This mixture is ignited by means of a 
spark produced by the spark plug. Since the ignition 
is done by spark, the petrol engine is called Spark 
Ignition engine (SI Engine). In the diesel engine, the 
air entrapped in the cylinder during the suction stroke 
is highly compressed during compression stroke. 
This compression increases the air temperature 
beyond the self-ignition temperature of diesel. The 
desired quantity of diesel in the form of ﬁ ne spray 
is then admitted into the cylinder near the end of the 
compression stroke. The turbulent hot air ignites the 
diesel. Since the ignition is done by compression of 
air, the diesel engine is called Compression Ignition 
engine (CI engine).
Compared with petrol engines, the diesel engines 
are more economical due to high thermal efﬁ ciency. 
They have more uniform torque over a wide range 
of speeds due to better volumetric efﬁ ciency. The 
diesel engines run at low speeds, resulting in low 
maintenance costs. They are more reliable and safe 
due to robust construction. On the other hand, petrol 
engines have low initial cost and higher power to 
weight ratio compared with diesel engine.
Internal combustion engines are also classiﬁ ed as 
‘two-stroke cycle’ and ‘four-stroke cycle’ engines. 
The two-stroke cycle engine is an engine which 
requires two strokes of the piston or one revolution 
of the crankshaft to complete one cycle. A four-stroke 
cycle engine is an engine which requires four strokes 
of the piston or two revolutions of the crankshaft to 
complete one cycle. Four-stroke cycle engines have 
lower fuel consumption and higher efﬁ ciency. Two-
stroke cycle engines are light in weight and have 
compact construction. 
Two-stroke cycle petrol engines are mainly used 
in scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers. Four-
stroke cycle petrol engines are used in cars. Four-
stroke cycle diesel engines are used in heavy-duty 
applications such as buses, trucks, locomotives and 
power generating sets.
Although internal combustion engine consists 
of a large number of parts, in this chapter we will 
discuss the design principles of the following main 
components: 
 
(i) Cylinder and cylinder liner
 
(ii) Piston, piston rings and gudgeon pin
 (iii) Connecting rod with big and small ends
 (iv) Crankshaft, crank and crank pin
 
(v) Valve gear mechanism
Engine design is a specialized subject and it 
differs from machine design. The discussion in this 
chapter is restricted to basic principles applied to 
design of engine components.
844 Design of Machine Elements
25.2 CYLINDER AND CYLINDER LINER
There are two basic functions of an IC engine 
cylinder. The primary function is to retain the 
working ﬂ uid such as the mixture of air and petrol 
or air and diesel, while the secondary function is to 
guide the piston. The combustion of fuel takes place 
inside the cylinder and very high temperatures are 
encountered. Therefore, it is necessary to provide 
some arrangement for cooling the cylinder. There 
are two types of cooling systems—air-cooling and 
water-cooling. Small, single-cylinder engines are 
usually air-cooled. Such cylinders are provided with 
ﬁ ns over the outer surface of the cylinder. Excess 
heat of combustion is transmitted by the cylinder 
wall to the surroundings through the ﬁ ns. The ﬁ ns 
increase the surface area of the cylinder wall and 
improve the overall heat transfer coefﬁ cient. Air-
cooled engines are mainly used on scooters and 
motorcycles.
In small engines, the cylinder and frame is made 
of one-piece casting. In large engines, a separate 
cylinder liner is used. The cylinder liner, water 
jacket and frame are manufactured separately and 
then assembled. The construction of cylinder liner is 
illustrated in Fig. 25.1. The use of separate cylinder 
liner has the following advantages:
 
(i) Cylinder liners are more economical because 
they can be easily replaced after being worn 
out. It is not necessary to replace the complete 
assembly of cylinder, jacket and frame. 
Fig. 25.1 Cylinder liner
 
(ii) Instead of using better-grade material for 
all parts of the cylinder assembly, only the 
cylinder liner is made of better-grade wear 
resistant cast iron. The frame and jacket can 
be made of ordinary cast iron. 
 (iii) Use of cylinder liner allows for longitudinal 
expansion. 
There are two types of cylinder liners—dry liner 
and wet liner as shown in Fig. 25.2. A dry liner is 
a cylinder liner which does not have any direct 
contact with cooling water in the jacket. A wet liner 
is a cylinder liner which has outer surface in direct 
contact with cooling water in the jacket.
Fig. 25.2 Dry and wet liners
The desirable properties of materials for cylinders 
and cylinder liners are as follows:
 
(i) It should be strong enough to withstand high 
gas pressure during the combustion of fuel.
 
(ii) It should be strong enough to withstand 
thermal stresses due to heat transfer through 
the cylinder wall.
 (iii) It should be hard enough to resist wear due 
to piston movement. It should have good 
surface ﬁ nish to reduce friction and wear 
during the piston movement.
 (iv) It should be corrosion resistant.
Cylinders and cylinder liners are usually made of 
grey cast iron with homogeneous and close grained 
structure. They are centrifugally cast. For heavy-
duty cylinders, nickel cast iron and nickel chromium 
cast iron are used. In some cases, cast steel and 
aluminium alloys are used for cylinders.

25.3 BORE AND LENGTH OF CYLINDER 
In engine terminology, ‘bore’ means the inner 
diameter of the cylinder. The main dimensions of 
the cylinder are calculated by using the following 
equations from Applied Thermodynamics.
 
IP
BP
= h  
 (25.1)
where,
IP = indicated power or power produced inside 
the cylinder (W)
BP = brake power or power developed at the 
crankshaft (W)
 h = mechanical efﬁ ciency (in fraction)
In examples where mechanical efﬁ ciency is not 
speciﬁ ed, it is assumed as 80% or 0.8.
n = N (for two-stroke engines)
 n = N/2 (for four-stroke engines) 
 (25.2)
where,
n = number of working strokes per minute
N = engine speed (rpm)

A = pD2

n = number of working strokes/min
D = diameter of cylinder or bore (mm)
The (l/D) ratio for the cylinder is usually assumed 
from 1.25 to 2. In examples where (l/D) ratio is not 
speciﬁ ed, it is assumed as 1.5.
 
 l = 1.5 D (in mm) = 1 5

. D
Ê

¯˜  (in m)
The length of the cylinder is more than the length 
of the stroke. There is clearance on both sides of the 
stroke. The total clearance on two sides is taken as 
15% of the stroke length.
 
L = 1.15 l
where,
 
L = length of cylinder (mm)
25.4 THICKNESS OF CYLINDER WALL
The engine cylinder or cylinder liner is treated as a 
thin cylinder. Equation (22.3) of Chapter 22 derived 
for the thickness of thin cylinder is modiﬁ ed and 
used for engine cylinder.

sc = permissible circumferential (hoop) stress 
for cylinder material (N/mm2)
 
C = reboring allowance (mm)
Note
 
(i) In examples where maximum gas pressure 
inside the cylinder is not speciﬁ ed, it is 
assumed as 10 times of the indicated mean 
effective pressure,
 
 pmax. = 10 (pm)
 
(ii) The circumferential hoop stress (sc) in
Eq. (25.4) is the allowable tensile stress (st). 
Since the cylinder material is brittle,
 
sc = st = S

 (iii) In examples where ultimate tensile strength 
of cylinder material and factor of safety are 
not speciﬁ ed, the allowable circumferential 
stress (sc) is taken as 35 to 100 N/mm2.
 (iv) The reboring allowance is taken from Table 
25.1. Reboring is required to compensate 
uneven wear on the inner wall of the 
cylinder. Reboring allowance is additional 
metal thickness over and above that required 
to withstand maximum gas pressure inside 
the cylinder. It is provided to compensate for 
reboring at intervals during the lifetime of 
the cylinder.

Empirical Relationships There are some empirical 
relationships used in cylinder design. They are as 
follows:
 
(i) The thickness of cylinder wall varies from 5 
to 25 mm depending upon the cylinder bore. 
It can be calculated by using the following 
empirical equation:
 
t = 0.045 D + 1.6 (mm)
 
(ii) Thickness of dry liner = 0.03D to 0.035D 
(mm)
 (iii) Thickness of water jacket wall = (1/3) t to 
(3/4) t,
 (iv) Thickness of water jacket wall = 0.032D + 
1.6 (mm)
 
(v) Water space between outer cylinder wall and 
inner jacket wall = 9 mm for 75 mm cylinder 
bore to 75 mm for 750 mm cylinder bore,
 (vi) Water space between outer cylinder wall and 
inner jacket wall = 0.08D + 6.5 mm
 (vii) Thickness of cylinder ﬂ ange = 1.2 t to
1.4 t Also,
 (viii) Thickness of cylinder ﬂ ange = 1.25 d to 1.5 d
 
(d = nominal diameter of bolt or stud)
 (ix) Radial distance between outer diameter of 
ﬂ ange and pitch circle diameter of studs = 
(d + 6) to (1.5d) mm
25.5 STRESSES IN CYLINDER WALL
Apparent Stresses As shown in Fig. 25.3, there 
are two principal stresses in engine cylinder—
the circumferential hoop stress (sc) and longitudinal 
stress (s1). It is assumed that the stresses are 
uniformly distributed over the wall thickness.

Stresses Two 
principal 
stresses—the 
circumferential hoop stress (sc) and longitudinal 
stress (s1) are tensile stresses and they act at right 
angles to each other. Therefore, net stresses in these 
directions are reduced. The net stresses are given by,
 
(sc)net = sc – msl 
(25.7)
 
(sl)net = s1 – msc 
(25.8)
where,
 
sc = apparent circumferential stress  (N/mm2) 
(obtained by Eq. 25.5)
 
sl = apparent longitudinal stress (N/mm2) 
(obtained by Eq. 25.6)
Design of IC Engine Components 847
 (sc )net = net circumferential stress (N/mm2)
 (sl )net = net longitudinal stress (N/mm2)
 
m = Poisson’s ratio
The cylinder material is usually brittle such as cast 
iron. The value of Poisson’s ratio is taken as 0.25.
 
m = 0.25
25.6 CYLINDER HEAD 
In most of the IC engines, a separate cylinder head 
or cylinder cover is provided. The cylinder cover 
accommodates the following parts:
 
(i) Inlet and exhaust valves
 
(ii) Air and gas ports
 (iii) Spark plug in case of petrol engine and 
atomizer in case of diesel engine
The shape of the cylinder head becomes 
complicated due to accommodation of the above 
units. In general, a box type section with considerable 
thickness is used for the cylinder head. Calculating 
the various dimensions of the actual cylinder head 
is a difﬁ cult exercise. However, in the preliminary 
stages of design, the cylinder head is assumed as a 
ﬂ at circular plate and its thickness is calculated by 
the following equation:
 
t
D
Kp
h
c
=
max.
s
 
 (25.9)
where,
th = thickness of cylinder head (mm)
K = constant (K = 0.162)
sc = allowable circumferential stress (N/mm2)
Note
 
(i) The circumferential hoop stress (sc) in
Eq. (25.9) is the allowable tensile stress (st). 
Since the material of the cylinder head is 
brittle, 
 
sc = st = 
S
fs
ut
(
)
 
(ii) In examples where ultimate tensile strength 
of cylinder head material and factor of 
safety are not speciﬁ ed, the allowable 
circumferential stress (sc) is taken as 30 to 
50 N/mm2.
25.7 DESIGN OF STUDS FOR CYLINDER 
HEAD
Studs are used to make the assembly of cylinder, 
cylinder head and gasket; and provide a leakproof 
joint. Initially, the studs are tightened by means of 
spanner to induce a preload and in working conditions 
they are further subjected to tensile stresses due to 
internal gas pressure acting on the cylinder head. 
There are three important parameters in design of 
studs—number of studs, nominal diameter and pitch 
of studs.
(i) Number of Studs The number of studs (z) should 
be between the following limits,
Minimum number of studs = 0.01D + 4
Maximum number of studs = 0.02D + 4 (25.10)
(ii) Diameter of Studs The core diameter of studs 
is obtained by equating the maximum gas force 
acting on the cylinder cover to the resisting force 
offered by all studs.

(ii) In examples where the yield strength of

taken as 35 to 70 N/mm2.
 
  The nominal diameter of studs is obtained 
by the following relationship:
 
d
dc
= 0 8.  
 (25.12)
(iii) Pitch of Studs The pitch circle diameter of 
the studs is obtained by the following empirical 
relationship:
 
 Dp = D + 3d 
 (25.13)
 
 Pitch of studs = 
pD
z
P  
 (25.14)
In order to obtain a leakproof joint, the pitch of 
studs should be between the following two limits:
Minimum pitch = 19 d
Maximum pitch = 28 5.
d  
(25.15)
It should be noted that the above analysis is 
elementary. In practice, various parameters are taken 
into consideration for calculating the size of studs. 
They include stiffness of gasket, stiffness of ﬂ anges of 
cylinder and cover and initial preload on the stud. The 
reader should refer to Example 22.9 of Chapter 22 for 
this type of treatment. Further, the studs are subjected 
to ﬂ uctuating load due to variation of gas pressure 
inside the cylinder from zero to (pmax). The reader 
should refer to Section 7.18 of Chapter 7 on ‘Bolted 
joint under ﬂ uctuating load’ for this type of treatment.
Example 25.1 The cylinder of a four-stroke diesel 
engine has the following speciﬁ cations:
Brake power = 3.75 kW
Speed = 1000 rpm
Indicated mean effective pressure = 0.35 MPa
Mechanical efﬁ ciency = 80%
Determine the bore and length of the cylinder 
liner.

the cylinder (L) is given by,
 L = 1.15 l = 1.15 (168) = 193.2 mm or 195 mm  (ii)

Example 25.4 The cylinder of a four-stroke diesel 
engine has the following speciﬁ cations:
Brake power = 7.5 kW
Speed = 1400 rpm
Indicated mean effective pressure = 0.35 MPa
Mechanical efﬁ ciency = 80%
Maximum gas pressure = 3.5 MPa
The cylinder liner and head are made of grey cast 
iron FG 260 (Sut = 260 N/mm2 and m = 0.25). The 
studs are made of plain-carbon steel 40C8 (Syt = 
380 N/mm2). The factor of safety for all parts is 6.
Calculate: 
 
(i) bore and length of the cylinder liner
 
(ii) thickness of the cylinder liner
 (iii) thickness of the cylinder head
 (iv) size, number and pitch of studs
Solution
Given BP = 7.5 kW = 7500 W N = 1400 rpm

25.8 PISTON
The piston is a reciprocating part of IC engine that 
performs a number of functions. The main functions 
of the piston are as follows:
 
(i) It transmits the force due to gas pressure 
inside the cylinder to the crankshaft through 
the connecting rod.
 
(ii) It compresses the gas during the compression 
stroke.
 (iii) It seals the inside portion of the cylinder from 
the crankcase by means of piston rings.
 (iv) It takes the side thrust resulting from 
obliquity of the connecting rod.
 
(v) It dissipates large amount of heat from the 
combustion chamber to the cylinder wall.
Trunk type piston, as shown in Fig. 25.4, is used 
in IC engines. It consists of the following parts:
(i) Piston Head or Crown It is the top portion of 
the piston which withstands the gas pressure inside 
the cylinder. It has ﬂ at, concave or convex shape 
depending upon the construction of combustion 
chamber.
Fig. 25.4 
Piston
(ii) Piston Rings They act as seal and prevent the 
leakage of gas past the piston. Piston rings are also 
called ‘compression’ rings.
(iii) Oil Scraper Ring It prevents the leakage of 
lubricating oil past the piston into the combustion 
chamber. 
(iv) Piston Skirt It is the lower part of the piston 
below the piston rings which acts as bearing surface 
for the side thrust exerted by the connecting rod.
(v) Piston Pin It connects the piston to the 
connecting rod. It is also called ‘gudgeon’ pin or 
‘wrist’ pin.
The design requirements for the piston are as 
follows: 
854 Design of Machine Elements
 
(i) It should have sufﬁ cient strength to withstand 
the force due to combustion of fuel and also 
the inertia forces due to reciprocating parts.
 
(ii) It should have sufﬁ cient rigidity to withstand 
thermal and mechanical distortions.
 (iii) It should have adequate capacity to dissipate 
the heat from the crown to the cylinder wall 
through the piston rings and the skirt.
 (iv) It should have minimum weight to reduce the 
inertia force due to reciprocating motion.
 
(v) It should form an efﬁ cient seal to prevent 
leakage of ﬂ ue gases from combustion 
chamber to the crankcase past the piston. It 
should also prevent leakage of lubricating 
oil into the combustion chamber past the 
piston.
 (vi) It should have sufﬁ cient bearing area to take 
the side thrust and prevent undue wear. 
 (vii) It should result in noiseless operation.
 (viii) It should provide adequate support for the 
piston pin, which connects the small end of 
the connecting rod.
25.9 PISTON MATERIALS
Commonly used materials for IC engine pistons are 
cast iron, cast steel, forged steel, cast aluminium 
alloys and forged aluminium alloy. Compared with 
cast iron, aluminium alloy pistons have the following 
advantages: 
 
(i) The thermal conductivity of aluminium 
alloys is approximately three times that of 
cast iron. Therefore, an aluminium alloy 
piston has less variation in temperature from 
the crown to the piston rings.
 
(ii) The density of aluminium alloy is about one 
third that of cast iron. This results in light 
weight construction and reduces inertia forces.
Cast iron pistons offer the following advantages:
 
(i) Cast iron pistons have higher strength 
compared with aluminium alloy pistons. 
As the temperature increases, the strength 
of aluminium alloy piston decreases rapidly 
compared with cast iron piston. Due to 
higher strength, it is possible to provide thin 
sections for the parts of cast iron piston.
 
(ii) The wear strength of a cast iron piston is 
more than corresponding aluminium alloy 
piston.
 (iii) The coefﬁ cient of thermal expansion of 
aluminium alloy is approximately twice 
that of cast iron. Therefore,  aluminium alloy 
pistons need more clearance between the 
cylinder wall and piston rings.
 Cast iron pistons are used for moderately rated 
engines with piston speed below 6 m/s. Aluminium 
alloy pistons are used for highly rated engines with 
piston speeds above 6 m/s.
25.10 THICKNESS OF PISTON HEAD
There are two types of piston heads—ﬂ at plate type 
and cup type as shown in Fig. 25.5. The selection 
of the type depends upon the required volume for 
combustion chamber and the arrangement of valves.
 
Fig. 25.5 Types of piston head
There are two criteria for calculating the thickness 
of piston head—strength and heat dissipation. On 
the basis of strength criterion, the piston head is 
treated as a ﬂ at circular plate of uniform thickness 
ﬁ xed at the outer edge and subjected to uniformly 
distributed gas pressure (pmax.) over the entire 
surface area. According to Grashoff’s formula, the 
thickness of the piston head is given by,

where,
 
th = thickness of piston head (mm)
 
D = cylinder bore (mm)
 pmax. = maximum gas pressure or explosion 
pressure (MPa or N/mm2)
 
sb = permissible bending stress (N/mm2)
Note
 
(i) The bending stress (sb) in Eq. (25.16) is 
the allowable tensile stress (st). Since the 
material of the cylinder head is brittle, 
 
sb = st = S
fs
ut
(
)
 
(ii) In examples where ultimate tensile strength 
of the piston material and factor of safety are 
not speciﬁ ed, the allowable bending stress 
(sb) for grey cast iron is taken from 35 to 
40 N/mm2. For aluminium alloy, it can be 
assumed from 50 to 90 N/mm2.
 (iii) The maximum gas pressure (pmax.) may rise 
up to 8 MPa. The average value of maximum 
gas pressure is taken as 4 to 5 MPa or N/mm2.
There is an empirical formula recommended by 
Held and Favary for the thickness of the piston head. 
According to this formula,
 
 th = 0.032 D + 1.5 mm 
 (25.17)
The piston head absorbs the heat during 
combustion of fuel and transmits it to the cylinder 
wall. It should have sufﬁ cient thickness to quickly 
transfer the heat to the cylinder wall. On the basis 
of heat dissipation, the thickness of the piston head 
is given by,

 For aluminium alloy,  k = 175 W/m/°C

25.11 PISTON RIBS AND CUP
The piston head is provided with a number of ribs 
for the following reasons:
 
(i) Ribs strengthen the piston head against the 
gas pressure. They increase the rigidity and 
prevent distortion of piston head.
 
(ii) Ribs transmit a large portion of combustion 
heat from the piston head to the piston rings. 
This reduces the temperature difference 
between the centre and edge of piston head.
 (iii) The side thrust created by obliquity of 
connecting rod is transmitted to the piston 
at the piston pin. It is then transmitted to the 
cylinder wall through the skirt. The stiffening 
rib provided at the centre of boss and extending 
around the skirt, distributes the side thrust more 
uniformly and prevents distortion of the skirt.
856 Design of Machine Elements
Guidelines for ribs
 
(i) When the thickness of the piston head is
6 mm or less, no ribs are required. When 
the thickness of the piston head is more than
6 mm, a suitable number of ribs are required.
 
 th £ 6 mm  ( no ribs)
 
 th > 6 mm (provide ribs) 
 (25.20)
 
(ii) The number of ribs is given by,

 A cup provides additional space for combustion 
of fuel. Provision of cup at the top of the piston head 
depends upon the volume of combustion chamber. 
It also depends upon the arrangement of valves. If 
inlet and exhaust valves open and close at angles 
near the top dead centre, then there is possibility that 
either inlet or exhaust valve may strike the piston 
top due to overtaking. A spherical cavity in the form 
of cup is provided for this purpose.
Guidelines for piston cup
 
(i) When the ratio of stroke length to bore (l/D) 
is up to 1.5, a cup is required on the top of 
the piston.
 
 (l/D) £ 1.5  (cup required)
 
 (l/D) > 1.5  (no cup required)  
(25.23)
 
(ii) The radius of cup is given by,
 
  radius of cup = 0.7D 
(25.24)
25.12 PISTON RINGS
In IC engines, two types of piston rings are used, viz., 
compression rings and oil scraper rings. The main 
function of compression rings is to maintain a seal 
between the cylinder wall and piston and prevent 
leakage of gas past the piston. They also transfer heat 
from the piston head to the cylinder wall. Piston rings 
also absorb ﬂ uctuations in side thrust. Oil scraper 
rings or oil control rings are provided below the 
compression rings. They provide proper lubrication 
of the cylinder liner and reduce frictional losses. Oil 
scraper rings allow sufﬁ cient quantity of lubricating
oil to move up during the upward stroke and at the 
same time, scrap the excess oil from the inner surface of 
the liner and send it back to the crankcase. This prevents 
the leakage of oil into the combustion chamber.
Guidelines for design of piston rings
(i) Materials of Piston Rings Piston rings are 
usually made of grey cast iron and in some cases, 
alloy cast iron. Grey cast iron has excellent wear 
resistance. It also retains the spring characteristic at 
high temperatures. In some cases, piston rings are 
chromium plated to reduce wear.
(ii) Number of Piston Rings There are no strict 
rules for deciding the number of compression rings. 
The number of compression rings in automobile and 
aircraft engines is usually between 3 to 4. In stationary 
diesel engines, 5 to 7 compression rings are used. The 
number of oil scraper rings is usually between 1 to 3.
(iii) Dimensions of Cross-section The compression 
rings have rectangular cross-section as shown in Fig. 
25.6(a). The radial width of the ring is given by,
 
b
D
pw
t
=
3
s
 
 (25.25)
where,
 
b = radial width of ring (mm)
 
pw = allowable radial pressure on cylinder 
wall (N/mm2)
 
st = permissible tensile stress for ring material 
(N/mm2)
Note
 
(i) The radial wall pressure is usually taken 
from 0.025 to 0.042 MPa.
 
(ii) The permissible tensile stress for cast iron 
rings is taken from 85 to 110 N/mm2.
The axial thickness of piston ring is given by,
 
h = (0.7b) to b 
(25.26)
where h is the axial thickness of the piston ring in mm.
There is a limit on the minimum axial thickness. 
It is given by,
 
 hmin. = 
D
z

Ê
ËÁ
ˆ
¯˜
z = number of rings
Design of IC Engine Components 857
It is preferred to provide more number of thin 
piston rings than a small number of thick rings. It 
has the following advantages:
  (a) Thin rings reduce frictional loss and wear of 
the surface.
  (b) More number of thin rings have better 
sealing action than a few thick rings.
  (c) Thin rings occupy less piston length.
  (d) More number of thin rings provide better heat 
transfer from the piston top to the cylinder.
(iv) Gap between Free Ends The diameter of a piston 
ring is slightly more than the cylinder bore (D). A 
part of the ring is slightly cut diagonally as shown 
in Fig. 25.6(b). During the assembly, the ring is 
compressed diagonally and passed into the liner. The 
gap G between the free ends of the ring is as follows:
 G = 3.5 b to 4 b (before assembly)
 G = 0.002 D to 0.004 D
 
(after assembly in cylinder) 
 (25.27)

(v) Width of Top Land and Ring Lands Refer to 
Fig. 25.7 for top land and ring lands.
Fig. 25.7 Grooves for piston rings
The distance from the top of the piston to the ﬁ rst 
ring groove (h1) is called top land. It is given by,
 
 h1 = ( th) to (1.2th) 
       (25.28)
The distance between two consecutive ring 
grooves (h2) is called the width of the ring groove 
and is given by,
 
 h2 = 0.75 h to h 
(25.29) 
 25.13 PISTON BARREL
The piston barrel is shown in Fig. 25.8. It is the 
cylindrical portion of the piston below the piston head.
The thickness of the piston barrel at the top end 
is given by,
 
t3 = (0.03D + b + 4.9) 
(25.30)
where,
 t3 = thickness of piston barrel at the top end (mm)
 b = radial width of ring (mm)
The thickness of piston barrel at the lower or 
open end is given by,
 t4 = (0.25 t3) to (0.35 t3) 
 (25.31)
t4 = thickness piston barrel at open end (mm)

858 Design of Machine Elements
25.14 PISTON SKIRT
As shown in Fig. 25.4, the cylindrical portion of
the piston between the last scrapper ring and the
open end is called the piston skirt. The piston skirt 
acts as a bearing surface for the side thrust. The 
length of the skirt should be such that the bearing 
pressure due to side thrust is restricted to 0.25 
MPa on the projected area. In high speed engines,
the bearing pressure up to 0.5 MPa is allowed to 
reduce the weight of the reciprocating piston. The 
maximum side thrust will occur during expansion 
stroke.

is as follow:

(25.33)
The total length of the piston is given by,
 L = top land + length of ring section + length of skirt  
 
(25.34)
The empirical relationship for the length of the 
piston is as follows.
 
 L = D to 1.5D 
 (25.35)
25.15 PISTON PIN
The function of the piston pin is to connect the piston 
to the connecting rod. It is also called ‘gudgeon’ pin 
or ‘wrist’ pin. It is made of hollow circular cross-
section to reduce its weight. It is often tapered on 
the inside and the smallest diameter is at the centre 
of the pin. The piston pin passes through the bosses 
provided on the inner side of the piston skirt and a 
bearing bush inside the small end of the connecting 
rod as shown in Fig. 25.9(a). The end movement of 
the piston pin is restricted by means of circlips.
Fig. 25.9 Piston pin as beam
 There are two types of connections between the 
piston pin and the small end of the connecting rod, 
viz., ‘full-ﬂ oating’ type and ‘semi-ﬂ oating’ type. A 
full-ﬂ oating piston pin is free to turn both in the 
piston bosses as well as the bush in the small end of 
the connecting rod. The end movement of the pin is 
restricted by circlips. The semi-ﬂ oating piston pin 
is either free to turn in the piston bosses and rigidly 
ﬁ xed to the small end of the connecting rod, or free 
to turn in the bush of the small end and rigidly ﬁ xed 
to the piston bosses by means of screws.
Design of IC Engine Components 859
 The piston pin is made of carbon steel or alloy 
steel. It is hardened and ground to reduce wear while 
turning inside the phosphor bronze bush. There are 
two criteria for design of the piston pin—bearing 
consideration and bending failure.
(i) Bearing Consideration The piston pin is partly 
in contact with piston bosses and partly with the 
bush of the connecting rod as shown in Fig. 25.9(a). 
The bearing area of the piston pin is approximately 
divided between the piston bosses and the connecting 
rod bush. It is assumed that the length of the pin 
in the connecting rod bush is 45% of the piston 
diameter (D) or cylinder bore. Therefore,
 
 l1 = 0.45D 
(25.36)
where,
 l1 = length of piston pin in the bush of the small 
end of the connecting rod (mm)
The outer diameter of the piston pin (do) is 
determined by equating the force acting on the 
piston and the resisting bearing force offered by the 
piston pin:

where,

do = outer diameter of piston pin (mm)
Note
 
(i) The bearing pressure at the bushing of the 
small end of the connecting rod (pb)1 is taken 
as 25 MPa.
 
(ii) The inner diameter of the piston pin is taken 
as 0.6 times of the outer diameter.
 
 di = 0.6do 
(25.38)
 (iii) The mean diameter of the piston bosses is 
given by,
 Mean diameter of piston bosses = 1.4do
(for grey cast iron piston)
 Mean diameter of piston bosses = 1.5 do
(for aluminium alloy piston)

Using the above relationships, the maximum 
bending stress in the piston pin at the central plane 
is calculated.
Note The allowable bending stress for the piston 
pin should not exceed the following values:
 sb = 84 N/mm2 (for case hardened carbon steel)
 sb = 140 N/mm2 (for heat treated alloy steels)
(iii) Piston Clearances The clearance between 
the cylinder liner and piston is provided to take 
care of thermal expansion and distortion under 
load. When the clearance is insufﬁ cient, ‘piston 
seizure’ occurs. On the other hand, when clearance 
is excessive, ‘piston slap’ occurs resulting in piston 
running with excessive noise. The magnitude of 
860 Design of Machine Elements
piston clearance varies from 0.0375 to 0.1875 mm 
depending upon the piston diameter and the type of 
engine. In aluminium alloy piston, the clearance is 
twice that of cast iron piston. The clearance is less 
when proper cooling system is provided resulting in 
smaller thermal expansion.
Example 25.6 The following data is given for a 
four-stroke diesel engine:
Cylinder bore = 250 mm
Length of stroke = 300 mm 
Speed = 600 rpm
Indicated mean effective pressure = 0.6 MPa 
Mechanical efﬁ ciency = 80%
Maximum gas pressure = 4 MPa 
Fuel consumption = 0.25 kg per BP per h
Higher caloriﬁ c value of fuel = 44 000 kJ/kg
Assume that 5% of the total heat developed in 
the cylinder is transmitted by the piston. The piston 
is made of grey cast iron FG 200 (Sut = 200 N/mm2 
and k = 46.6 W/m/°C) and the factor of safety is 5. 
The temperature difference between the centre and 
the edge of the piston head is 220°C.

strength consideration.
 
(ii) Calculate the thickness of piston head by 
thermal consideration.
 (iii) Which criterion decides the thickness of 
piston head?
 (iv) State whether the ribs are required.
 
(v) If so, calculate the number and thickness of

Example 25.9 The following data is given for the 
piston of a four-stroke diesel engine:

25.16 CONNECTING ROD
The connecting rod consists of an eye at the small end 
to accommodate the piston pin, a long shank and a 
big end opening split into two parts to accommodate 
the crank pin. The construction of connecting rod is 
illustrated in Fig. 25.12. The basic function of the 
connecting rod is to transmit the push and pull forces 
from the piston pin to the crank pin. The connecting 
rod transmits the reciprocating motion of the piston 
to the rotary motion of the crankshaft. It also transfers 
lubricating oil from the crank pin to the piston pin and 
provides a splash or jet of oil to the piston assembly.
The connecting rod of an IC engine is made by 
the drop forging process and the outer surfaces are 
left unﬁ nished. Most internal combustion engines 
have a conventional two-piece connecting rod. The 
whole rod is forged in one piece; the bearing cap is 
cut off, faced and bolted in place for ﬁ nal machining 
of the big end. The small end of the rod is generally 
made as a solid eye and then machined.
868 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 25.12 Connecting Rod
The connecting rod is subjected to the force of 
gas pressure and the inertia force of the reciprocating 
part. It is one of the most heavily stressed parts of the 
IC engine. The materials used for the connecting rod 
are either medium carbon steels or alloy steels. The 
medium carbon steels contain 0.35 to 0.45 per cent 
carbon. The alloy steels include nicke chromium 
or chromium molybdenum steels. Medium carbon 
steels are used for the connecting rods of industrial 
engines. Alloy steels are used for connecting rods of 
automobile and aero engines.
There are two methods of lubrication of bearings 
at the two ends—splash lubrication and pressure 
feed lubrication. In splash lubrication, a spout is 
attached to the big end of the connecting rod and set 
at an angle to the axis of the rod. The spout dips into 
the sump of lubricating oil during the downward 
motion of the connecting rod and splashes the oil 
as the connecting rod moves up. The splashed up 
oil ﬁ nds its way into the small end bearing. In the 
pressure feed system, oil is fed under pressure to the 
crank pin bearing through the holes drilled in the 
crankshaft. From the crank pin bearing, the oil is fed 
to the small end bearing through the hole drilled in 
the shank of the connecting rod. 
The length of the connecting rod is an important 
consideration. When the connecting rod is short as 
compared to the crank radius, it has greater angular 
swing, resulting in greater side thrust on the piston. 
In high-speed engines, the ratio of the length of the 
connecting rod to the crank radius (L/r) is generally 
4 or less. In low-speed engines, the (L/r) ratio varies 
from 4 to 5.
Most of the connecting rods in high-speed 
engines have an I-section. It reduces the weight and 
inertia forces. It is also easy for forging. Most rods 
have a riﬂ e-drilled hole throughout the length from 
the small end to the big end to carry the lubricating 
oil to the piston pin bearing. In low-speed engines, 
circular cross-section is used.
25.17 BUCKLING OF CONNECTING ROD
The connecting rod is a slender engine component 
that has considerable length in proportion to its width 
and breadth. It is subjected to axial compressive 
force equal to maximum gas load on the piston. 
The compressive stress is of signiﬁ cant magnitude. 
Therefore, the connecting rod is designed as a 
column or a strut. The buckling of the connecting 
rod in two different planes—plane of motion and 
a plane perpendicular to the plane of motion is 
illustrated in Fig. 25.13. The following observations 
are made with reference to this ﬁ gure: 
Fig. 25.13 Buckling of Connecting Rod
 
(i) The buckling of the connecting rod in the 
plane of motion is shown in Fig. 25.13(a). 
In this plane, the ends of connecting rod 
are hinged in the crank pin and piston pin. 
Therefore, for buckling about the XX-axis, 
the end ﬁ xity coefﬁ cient (n) is one.
 
(ii) The buckling of the connecting rod in a 
plane perpendicular to the plane of motion 
is shown in Fig. 25.13(b). In this plane, the 
ends of the connecting rod are ﬁ xed due to 
constraining effect of bearings at the crank 
Design of IC Engine Components 869
pin and piston pin. Therefore, for buckling 
about the YY-axis, the end ﬁ xity coefﬁ cient 
(n) is four.
 (iii) Therefore, the connecting rod is four times 
stronger for buckling about the YY-axis as 
compared to buckling about the XX-axis.
 (iv) If a connecting rod is designed in such a 
way that it is equally resistant to buckling in 
either plane then

(v) The above relationship proves that I-section 
is ideally suitable for the connecting rod. On 
the other hand, a circular cross-section is 
unnecessarily strong for buckling about the 
YY-axis.
 Figure. 25.14 shows the typical proportions 
for the cross-section of the connecting rod for IC 
engine. For this cross-section,

A schematic diagram of the crank and connecting 
rod mechanism is shown in Fig. 25.15(a).  The 
following notations are used:
 P = force acting on the piston due to gas
   pressure (N)

 Ps = side thrust on the cylinder wall (N)
 Pc = force acting on the connecting rod (N)
 j = angle of inclination of connecting rod with
   line of stroke

From Fig. 25.15(b),

The maximum gas load occurs shortly after the 
dead centre position and at this instant (j = 3.3°).

From (a) and (b), it is concluded that the force 
acting on the connecting rod is equal to the maximum 
force acting on the piston due to gas pressure.

piston pin bearing as shown in Fig. 25.16(b), is 
usually a phosphor bronze bush of 3 mm thickness. 
It is a solid one-piece bushing made by casting and 
then ﬁ nished by grinding and reaming operations. 
It is designed by bearing considerations. The force

There is a peculiar term, ‘crush’, related to big 
end bearings. In order to make good seating of 
bearing bushes in the cap and connecting rod, the 
sleeve height is slightly more (approximately 0.05 
mm) than the half bore of the housing in which 
it ﬁ ts. This is called bearing ‘crush’ as shown in
Fig. 25.17(b). When the cap is tightened by bolts, 
the projecting bearing faces are squeezed in (or 
crushed) to form a press ﬁ t between the split bushes 
and cap and the big end of the connecting rod.
There is one more term called ‘shim’. The wear 
of the big end bearing is compensated by means of 
thin metallic strips between the cap and the ﬁ xed 
half. As wear takes place, one or more strips are 
removed and the cap is tightened. These strips are 
called shims.

25.21 WHIPPING STRESS
The small end of the connecting rod is subjected 
to pure translation motion while the big end is 
subjected to pure rotary motion. The intermediate 
points on the connecting rod move in elliptical 
orbits. The lateral oscillations of the connecting rod 
induce inertia forces that act all along the length of 
the connecting rod causing bending. This type of 
action is called ‘whipping’. The bending stress due 
to inertia force is called ‘whipping stress’.
The mass of the connecting rod per metre length 
is given by,
 
 ml = volume ¥ density
 
 = area ¥ length ¥ density
 
 ml = A (1)(r)
 
 m1 = Ar 
(25.65)
where,
 A = area of cross-section (m2)
r = mass density of the connecting rod (kg/m3)
For steels,
  r = 7800 kg/m3
Refer to the cross-section of the connecting rod 
illustrated in Fig. 25.14. For this cross-section,
 
 A = 11t2 
 
t = thickness of web or ﬂ anges (m)
The density of steel is taken as 7800 kg/m3. 
Therefore,
 
 ml = (11t2) r kg/m 
 (25.66)
It can be shown that the maximum bending 
moment occurs at a distance of

25.22 CRANKSHAFT
The crankshaft is an important part of IC engine 
that converts the reciprocating motion of the piston 
into rotary motion through the connecting rod. The 
crankshaft consists of three portions—crank pin, crank 
web and shaft. The big end of the connecting rod is 
attached to the crank pin. The crank web connects the 
crank pin to the shaft portion. The shaft portion rotates 
in the main bearings and transmits power to the outside 
source through the belt drive, gear drive or chain drive.
There are two types of crankshafts—side 
crankshaft and centre crankshaft as shown in Fig. 
25.19. The side crankshaft is also called the ‘overhung’ 
crankshaft. It has only one crank web and requires only 
two bearings for support. It is used in medium-size 
engines and large-size horizontal engines. The centre 
crankshaft has two webs and three bearings for support. 
It is used in radial aircraft engines, stationary engines 
and marine engines. It is more popular in automotive 
engines. Crankshafts are also classiﬁ ed as single-
throw and multi-throw crankshafts depending upon 
the number of crank pins used in the assembly. The 
crankshafts illustrated in Fig. 25.19 have one crank pin 
and are called single-throw crankshafts. Crankshafts 
used in multi-cylinder engines have more than one 
crank pin. They are called multi-throw crankshafts.
A crankshaft should have sufﬁ cient strength to 
withstand the bending and twisting moments to 
which it is subjected. In addition, it should have 
sufﬁ cient rigidity to keep the lateral and angular 
deﬂ ections within permissible limits. The crankshaft 
is subjected to ﬂ uctuating stresses and, as such, 
it should have sufﬁ cient endurance limit stress. 
Crankshafts are made by the drop forging process. 
Fig. 25.19 Types of Cranksha s
The popular materials used for crankshafts are plain-
carbon steels and alloy steels. The plain carbon steels 
include 40C8, 45C8 and 50C4. The alloy steels used 
for making crankshafts are nickel–chromium steels 
such as 16Ni3Cr2, 35Ni5Cr2 and 40Ni10Cr3Mo6.
Design of IC Engine Components 881
25.23 DESIGN OF CENTRE 
CRANKSHAFT
A crankshaft is subjected to bending and torsional 
moments due to the following three forces:
 
(i) Force exerted by the connecting rod on the 
crank pin
 
(ii) Weight of ﬂ ywheel (W) acting downward in 
the vertical direction
 (iii) Resultant belt tensions acting in the 
horizontal direction (P1 + P2)
In the design of the centre crankshaft, two cases 
of crank positions are considered. They are as 
follows:
Case I The crank is at the top dead centre position 
and subjected to maximum bending moment and no 
torsional moment.
Case II The crank is at an angle with the line of 
dead centre positions and subjected to maximum 
torsional moment.
We will consider these cases separately to 
determine the dimensions of the crankshaft.
25.24 CENTRE CRANKSHAFT AT
TOP DEAD CENTRE POSITION
The forces acting on the centre crankshaft at the top 
dead centre position are shown in Fig. 25.20. The 
crankshaft is supported on three bearings 1, 2 and 3.
Fig. 25.20 Centre Cranksha  at Dead Centre
Assumptions
 
(i) The engine is vertical and the crank is at the 
top dead centre position.
 
(ii) The belt drive is horizontal.
 (iii) The crankshaft is simply supported on 
bearings. 
(i) Bearing Reactions
  (a) The reactions at the bearings 1 and 2 due to 
force on the crank pin (Pp) are denoted by R1 
and R2 followed by sufﬁ x letters v and h. The 
vertical component of reaction is denoted 
by the sufﬁ x letter v such as (R1)v. The 
horizontal component of reaction is denoted 
by the  sufﬁ x letter h such as (R1)h.
 
(b) The reactions at the bearings 2 and 3 due to 
weight of the ﬂ ywheel (W) and sum of the 
belt tensions (P1 + P2) are denoted by R2¢ and 
R¢3 followed by sufﬁ x letters v and h such as 
(R¢2)v or  (R¢3)h.
Suppose,
 Pp = force acting on crank pin (N)
 D = diameter of piston (mm)
 pmax. = maximum gas pressure inside the cylinder 
(MPa or N/mm2)
 W = weight of ﬂ ywheel (N)
 P1 = tension in tight side of belt (N)
 P2 = tension in slack side of belt (N)
 b = distance between main bearings 1 and 2
 c = distance between bearings 2 and 3
At the top dead centre position, the thrust in the 
connecting rod will be equal to the force acting on 
piston.

(iii) Design of Left-hand Crank Web
Suppose,
 
w = width of crank web (mm)
 
t = thickness of crank web (mm)
The dimensions of crank web are calculated by 
empirical relationships and checked for the stresses. 
The empirical relationships are as follows:
 
 t = 0.7 dc 
 (25.68 d)
 
w = 1.14 dc 
(25.68 e) 
where,
 
dc = diameter of crank pin (mm)
As shown in Fig. 25.21, the left-hand crank web 
is subjected to eccentric load (R1)v.  There are two 
types of stresses in the central plane of the crank 
web, viz., direct compressive stress and bending 
stress due to eccentricity of reaction (R1)v.

balancing considerations. Therefore, the thickness 
and width of the right-hand crank web are made 
equal to that of the left-hand crank web.

25.25 CENTRE CRANKSHAFT AT ANGLE 
OF MAXIMUM TORQUE
(i) Components of Force on Crank Pin The position 
of the crank when it makes an angle (q) with the line 
of dead centres  is shown in Fig. 25.23. The torque is 
maximum when the tangential component of force 
on the crank pin is maximum. For this condition, the 
crank angle from the top dead centre position (q) 
is usually 25° to 35° for petrol engines and 30° to 
40° for diesel engines. In Fig. 25.23, the following 
notations are used:
 Pp = force acting on piston top due to gas pressure 
(N)
 Pq = thrust on connecting rod (N)
 Pt = tangential component of force on crank pin 
(N)
 Pr = radial component of force on crank pin (N)
 j = angle of inclination of connecting rod with 
the line of dead centres (deg)
 q = angle of inclination of crank with line of 
dead centres (deg)
Suppose p¢ is the gas pressure on the piston top 
for maximum torque condition.

(ii) Bearing Reactions The forces acting on the

are shown in Fig. 25.24. The crankshaft is supported 
on three bearings 1, 2 and 3. 
It is assumed that the portion of the crankshaft 
between bearings 1 and 2 is simply supported 
on bearings and subjected to tangential force Pt
and radial force Pr at the crank pin as shown in
Fig. 25.25. Due to the tangential component Pt, there 
are reactions (R1)h and (R2)h at bearings 1 and 2 
respectively. Similarly, due to the radial component 
Pr, there are reactions (R1)v and (R2)v at bearings 1 
and 2 respectively.

The value of (sc)max. should be less than the 
allowable compressive stress. If it exceeds the 
allowable compressive stress, the width of the web 
w can be increased because it does nor affect the 
other calculations.
(vii) Design of Left-hand Crank Web The left-hand 
crank web is not severely stressed to the extent of the 
right-hand crank web. Therefore, it is not necessary 
to check the stresses in the left-hand crank web. The 
thickness and width of the left-hand crank web are 
made equal to that of the right-hand crank web from 
balancing consideration.

Note The above-mentioned force analysis of the 
centre crankshaft is elementary in nature. The centre 
crankshaft is supported on three bearings and as 
such, it is a statically ‘indeterminate’ structure. Such 
problems are solved by using three equations, one for 
summation of vertical forces, one for summation of 
moments and the third by taking into consideration 
the deﬂ ection of the shaft. The geometry of the 
crankshaft is such that it is not possible to write 
down analytical equations. The problem is solved 
by using ﬁ nite element method in practice.
Example 25.18 Design a centre crankshaft for a 
single-cylinder vertical engine using the following 
data:
Cylinder bore = 125 mm
(L/r) ratio = 4.5
Maximum gas pressure = 2.5 MPa
Length of stroke = 150 mm
Weight of ﬂ ywheel cum belt pulley = 1 kN
Total belt pull = 2 kN
Width of hub for ﬂ ywheel cum belt pulley
 
= 200 mm
The torque on the crankshaft is maximum when the 
crank turns through 25° from the top dead centre and 
at this position the gas pressure inside the cylinder is 
2 MPa. The belts are in the horizontal direction.
Assume suitable data and state the assumptions 
you make.
Solution
Given D = 125 mm pmax. = 2.5 MPa = 2.5 N/mm2
(L /r) = 4.5 l = 150 mm W = 1 kN  = 1000 N
q = 25° (P1+ P2) = 2 kN = 2000 N
p¢ = 2 MPa = 2 N/mm2

the piston.

Refer to Fig. 25.20. The distance b between

Assumption 1 The centre to centre distance 
between the main bearings 1 and 2 is twice of the

Suppose,

As shown in Fig. 25.21, the central plane of 
the crank pin is subjected to maximum bending 
moment.
The bending moment at the central plane is

Step III Design of left-hand crank web
Suppose,
 
w = width of crank web (mm)
 
t = thickness of crank web (mm)
The dimensions of the crank web are calculated 
by empirical relationships and checked for the 
stresses. The empirical relationships are as follows:
 
 t = 0.7 dc = 0.7(65) = 45.5 mm
 or 
t = 46 mm 
(iii)
 
w = 1.14 dc = 1.14(65) = 74.1 mm 
 or 
 w = 75 mm 
 (iv) 
As shown in Fig. 25.21, the left-hand crank web 
is subjected to eccentric load (R1)v.  There are two 
types of stresses in the central plane of the crank 
web, viz., direct compressive stress and bending 
stress due to reaction (R1)v.

The total compressive stress is given by,

The total compressive stress is less than the 
allowable bending stress of 75 N/mm2 and the 
design of the crank web is safe.
Step IV Design of right-hand crank web
The right-hand and left-hand webs are made 
identical from balancing considerations. Therefore, 
the thickness and width of the right-hand crank web 
are made equal to that of the left-hand crank web.
Step V Design of shaft under ﬂ ywheel
The width of the hub for ﬂ ywheel cum belt pulley is 
given as 200 mm. It is observed from Fig. 25.20 that 
the centre to centre distance between bearings 2 and 
3 should be more than 200 mm to accommodate the 
bearings. We will assume,

The bending moment in the vertical plane due to

Suppose,

Refer to Fig. 25.25. The cross-section of the shaft

The left-hand crank web is not severely stressed to 
the extent of the right-hand crank web. Therefore, it 
is not necessary to check the stresses in the left-hand 
crank web. The thickness and width of the left-hand 
crank web are made equal to that of the right-hand 
crank web from balancing consideration.

Assuming the above value  of permissible bearing 
pressure, the dimensions dc and lc are calculated by 
using Eq. (25.70b) and Eq. (25.70c).  
After calculating the dimensions, it is necessary 
to check the bending stresses in the crank pin.
As shown in Fig. 25.26, the crank pin acts as a

25.27 SIDE CRANKSHAFT AT ANGLE OF 
MAXIMUM TORQUE
The torque is maximum when the tangential 
component of the force on the crank pin is maximum. 
For this condition, the crank angle from the top dead 
centre position (q) is usually 25º to 35º for petrol 
engines and 30º to 40° for diesel engines.
Assumptions
 
(i) The engine is vertical.
 
(ii) The belt drive is horizontal.
 (iii) The crankshaft is simply supported on 
bearings 1 and 2.
Suppose,
 Pp = force acting on piston top due to gas 
pressure (N)
 Pq = thrust on connecting rod (N)
 Pt = tangential component of force on crank 
pin (N)
 Pr = radial component of force on crank pin 
(N)
 j = angle of inclination of connecting rod with 
the line of dead centres (deg)

Example 25.19 Design an overhung crankshaft 
for a 300 × 350 mm single cylinder vertical engine 
using the following data:
Maximum gas pressure = 2.5 MPa
(L/r) ratio = 4.5
Weight of ﬂ ywheel cum belt pulley = 10 kN
Total belt pull = 5 kN
Width of hub for ﬂ ywheel cum belt pulley
 
= 150 mm
The torque on the crankshaft is maximum when the 
crank turns through 35° from the top dead centre and 
at this position the gas pressure inside the cylinder is 
1 MPa. The belts are in the horizontal direction.
Assume suitable data and state the assumptions 
you make.
Design of IC Engine Components 899
Solution
Given D = 300 mm
pmax. = 2.5 MPa = 2.5 N/mm2 (L /r) = 4.5
l = 350 mm W = 10 kN = 10 000 N q = 35°
(P1 +  P2) = 5 kN = 5000 N

permissible limit.
Step 2 Design of bearings
Refer to Fig. 25.26. Suppose,
 d1 = diameter of journal or shaft at the bearing
1 (mm)
 l1 = length of the bearing 1 (mm)
 sb = allowable bending stress for shaft (N/mm2)
 t = thickness of web (mm)
The thickness of the web is calculated by the 
following empirical relationship:
 
 t  = 0.60dc = 0.60(150) = 90 mm 
The length of the bearing is calculated by the 
following empirical relationship:
 l1= 1.75dc = 1.75(150) = 262.5  or  265 mm  
Refer to Fig. 25.26. The bending moment at the 
bearing 1 is given by,

25.28 VALVE GEAR MECHANISM
The valve gear mechanism is a subassembly of 
the IC engine and its function is to open and close 
the inlet and exhaust valves at a proper time with 
respect to the position of the piston and crankshaft. 
The fuel is admitted into the cylinder when the inlet 
valve is open. Also, the burnt gases escape when the 
exhaust valve is open. The valve gear mechanisms 
for vertical and horizontal engines are illustrated in 
Figs. 25.30 and 25.31 respectively. The main parts 
of a valve-gear mechanism are valve, spring, tappet, 
rocker arm, push rod, cam and camshaft. 
 Figure 25.30 shows the valve gear mechanism 
for a vertical engine with overhead valves. The 
camshaft is rotated by means of a belt drive from the 
crankshaft. As the camshaft rotates, the cam pushes 
the follower and the push rod upwards. The rocker 
arm is pivoted at its centre by means of a fulcrum 
pin. When the right end of the rocker arm is pushed 
up by the push rod, the left end moves downward. 
This compresses the spring and pushes the valve rod 
down in the cylinder, thereby causing the valve to 
open. When the follower moves over the circular 
portion of the cam, the spring expands and closes the 
valve. The spring pushes the left end of the rocker arm 
upward. This causes the right end to move downward 
and keeps the follower in contact with the cam. 
Fig. 25.30 Valve gear mechanism (vertical engine)
904 Design of Machine Elements
Fig. 25.31 Valve gear mechanism (horizontal engine)
 It should be noted that the valve is closed by a 
helical compression spring. One end of the spring is 
secured to the valve stem and the other end rests on 
the cylinder. The spring is initially compressed. The 
force due to initial compression presses the valve 
down on its seat. However, the opening of the valve 
is due to oscillatory motion of the rocker arm.
25.29 DESIGN OF VALVES
Two types of valves are used in IC engines, viz., 
poppet or mushroom valves and sleeve valves. There 
are limited applications of sleeve valves. They are 
used in very few automobile engines. The poppet 
valves, on the other hand, are frequently used in IC 
engines. The construction of a poppet valve is shown 
in Fig. 25.32. It consists of a disk called ‘head’ at the 
end of a rod called ‘stem’. The ‘face’ of the valve is a 
conical surface that comes in contact with a valve seat. 
It has a face angle varying from 30° to 45°. The conical 
surface of the valve results in self-centering property. 
There is small margin between the head and the face. 
There are two reasons of providing the margin—it 
avoids the sharp edges and a provision is made for 
regrinding of the valve. The lower end of valve stem 
has a groove. A spring retainer is ﬁ tted in this groove, 
which supports one end of the valve spring.
In slow-speed engines, valves have composite 
construction with a cast iron head and steel stem. 
In high-speed engines, one piece construction is 
used and valves are forged. The exhaust valves are 
subjected to high temperatures, as high as 1900°C to 
2200°C, during the peak of explosion. The material 
used for making valves should have the following 
characteristics:
 
(i) It should be heat resistant.
 
(ii) It should have a good thermal conductivity.
 (iii) It should be corrosion resistant.
 (iv) It should have a wear resistant surface.
 
(v) It should have shock resistance.
Fig. 25.32 Poppet Valve
The inlet valve is subjected to comparatively 
less temperature than the exhaust valve. Therefore, 
inlet valves are made of nickel–chromium steel. The 
exhaust valves are made of heat resistant silicon–
chromium steel. For heavy duty engines, valves 
are made of chromium–vanadium steel. The valves 
are heat treated and surface hardness for inlet and 
exhaust valves is in the range of 250 to 300 HB. The 
design of valves consists of the following steps:
(i) Diameter of Valve Port Suppose,
a = area of piston
v = mean velocity of piston
ap = area of port
vp = mean velocity of gas ﬂ owing through
 
 the port

The inlet ports are made 20% to 40% larger than 
the exhaust ports for better cylinder charging and 
scavenging.
(ii) Diameter of Valve Head  The projected width 
w of the valve seat is shown in Fig. 25.33. For a seat 
angle of 45°, the projected width of the valve seat is 
given by the following empirical relationship:
 w = (0.05 to 0.07) dp  or w = 0.06 dp

The diameter of the valve head (dv) is given by,
 dv = (dp + 2w) 
(iii) Thickness of Valve Disk The valve disk is 
assumed as a circular disk freely supported around 
its periphery and subjected to a uniformly distributed 
load pmax. as shown in Fig. 25.33. The thickness of 
the disk is calculated by the following equation:

dp = diameter of port (mm)
pmax. = maximum gas pressure (MPa or N/mm2)
sb = permissible bending stress (N/mm2)
The values of permissible bending stress (sb) are 
as follows:
 For carbon steel   sb = 50 to 60 N/mm2 
 For alloy steel  sb = 100 to 120 N/mm2
The margin or thickness of the valve disk at the 
edges is given by,
 Thickness of valve disk at edges = 0.75 to 0.85t

(v) Maximum Valve Lift Suppose,
 
hmax.  = maximum lift of valve (mm)
For continuous ﬂ ow, the mean velocity of the gas 
ﬂ ow through the valve is equal to that through the 
opening of the valve when it is lifted to a maximum. 
Therefore, the maximum lift of the valve is obtained 
by equating the area across the valve seat to the area 
of the port. As shown in Fig. 25.33,

The valve seat has the same angle as the valve 
seating surface. In practice, the angle of the valve 
seat is made 0.5° to 1° more than the valve angle. 
This difference is sometimes called ‘interference’ 
angle. It results in a more effective seal.
Example 25.20 Design an exhaust valve for a 
horizontal diesel engine using the following data:
Cylinder bore = 150 mm
Length of stroke = 275 mm
Engine speed = 500 rpm
Maximum gas pressure = 3.5 MPa 
Seat angle = 45°
Calculate: 
 
(i) diameter of the valve port;
 
(ii) diameter of the valve head;
 (iii) thickness of the valve head;
 (iv) diameter of the valve stem; and
 
(v) maximum lift of the valve.

25.30 DESIGN OF A ROCKER ARM
The basic function of rocker arm is to open or 
close the inlet or exhaust valve with respect to the 
motion of the cam and follower. The rocker arm for 
operating the exhaust valve is shown in Fig. 25.34. 
It is a two arm lever with the fulcrum in the middle. 
One end of the rocker arm that is actuated by the 
cam is forked and carries a roller. The other arm 
of the rocker arm consists of a plain boss where a 
tappet is screwed. In order to reduce the weight and 
inertia force, the cross-section of the rocker arm is 
Design of IC Engine Components 907
I-section. The arms of the rocker arm are made of 
uniform strength by tapering the width and depth 
dimensions. However, the thickness of the web and 
ﬂ anges is kept uniform.
Fig. 25.34 Rocker Arm for Exhaust Valve
Rocker arms are made of grey cast iron, malleable 
cast iron or cast steel. In four-stroke cycle engines, 
the rocker arm of the exhaust valve is more heavily 
loaded. On the other hand, the force required 
to operate the inlet valve is comparatively less. 
However, it is usual practice to make rocker arms 
for inlet and exhaust valves identical. This results 
in ease of manufacturing. The main objective of the 
rocker arm as a ‘lever’ is to change the direction 
of force and not the multiplication of the effort. 
Therefore, the two arms of the rocker arm are often 
made equal in moderate and low speed engines. In 
high speed engines, the (a/b) ratio is taken as (1/1.3). 
The forces acting on the rocker arm of the exhaust 
valve are illustrated in Fig. 25.35. The maximum 
force exerted by the valve rod on the tappet will 
determine the bending moment for the design of the 
cross-section of the rocker arm. This force consists 
of the following three factors:
 
(i) The gas pressure on the valve when it opens
 
(ii) The inertia force when the valve moves up
 (iii) The initial spring force to hold the valve on 
its seat against suction or negative pressure 
inside the cylinder during the suction stoke
The gas load Pg is given by,

given by,

It should be noted that the total force (Pi) on the 
rocker arm of the inlet valve consists of only two 
factors and it is given by,
 
 Pi =  Pa + Pi 
(25.81)
After calculating the forces, various portions of 
the rocker arm are designed in the following way.

of the eye are as follows: 
Thickness of each eye = l2/2
Outer diameter of eye = D2 = 2d2
The diameter of the roller should be more than 
the outer diameter of the eye by at least 5 mm.
When the roller pin is tight in the two eyes of the 
fork, failure occurs due to shear. On the other hand, 
when the pin is loose, it is subjected to bending 
moment. It acts as a beam as shown in Fig. 25.38. It 
is assumed that the load acting on the pin is uniformly 
distributed in the portion that is in contact with the 
roller. It is uniformly varying in two parts of the fork.

The bending stress calculated by the above 
equations should be within the limits.
(iii) Design of Cross-section of Rocker Arm As 
shown in Fig. 25.39, the arm is subjected to bending 
moment under the action of force Pe. The bending 
moment is maximum at the centre of the pivot. 
In general, the central section passing through 
the fulcrum pin is sufﬁ ciently strong to withstand 
bending moment. Therefore, we will consider the 
cross-section of the arm near the boss of the fulcrum 
pin. The outside diameter of the boss of the rocker 
arm at the fulcrum pin is twice the diameter of the 
fulcrum pin (2d1). Therefore,
 
Mb = Pe[a – d1] 
 (25.90)
The proportions of cross-section for the rocker arm 
are shown in Fig. 25.39(b). The moment of inertia 
of the cross-section is determined by subtracting the 
moment of inertia of the inner rectangle from that of 
910 Design of Machine Elements
the outer rectangle. The size of the outer rectangle is 
(2.5t ¥ 6t). The inner rectangle is formed by adding 
two vertical strips, each of width [(2.5t – t)/2] and 
height of (4t).

Fig. 25.39 Bending Stresses in Rocker Arm
The permissible values of bending stresses are as 
follows:
 For cast steel,  
sb = 50 to 60 N/mm2
 For forged steel, 
sb = 70 to 80 N/mm2
Assuming the above values of permissible 
bending stresses, the dimensions of the cross-section 
of the rocker arm are calculated.

25.31 DESIGN OF VALVE SPRING
The purpose of the valve spring is to exert a force on 
the rocker arm in order to maintain contact between 
the follower and cam at the other end. During the 
suction stroke, the initial spring force keeps the 
valve closed against negative pressure inside the 
cylinder. The total force acting on the spring of the 
exhaust valve consists of two factors, viz., the initial 
spring force and force required to lift the valve.  The 
initial spring force is given by,
Pi = area of valve ¥ maximum suction pressure

d = maximum lift of valve (mm)
Adding (a) and (b), the maximum force on spring 
(Pmax.) is given by,
 
 
 Pmax. = Pi + kd 
(25.93)
The following assumptions are made in the 
design of valve springs:
 
(i) The spring is made of oil-hardened and 
tempered valve spring wire of Grade-VW.
 
(ii) The stiffness of the spring is 10 N/mm.
 (iii) The allowable torsional shear stress for 
spring material is 250 to 350 N/mm2.
 (iv) The spring index (D/d) is 8.
 
(v) The spring has square and ground ends.

assumed as 15% of the maximum compression.
 Total gap = 0.15 dmax. 
Free length = solid length + dmax. + 0.15 dmax. 
(viii) Pitch of Coils
Pitch of coils = free length

When the natural frequency of vibrations of
spring coincides with the frequency of external 
periodic force, which acts on it, resonance occurs. 
In this state, the spring is subjected to a wave of 
successive compressions of coils that travels from 
one end to the other and back. This type of vibratory 
motion is called the ‘surge’ of spring. Surge is found 
in valve springs, which are subjected to periodic 
force. The natural frequency of helical compression 
springs held between two parallel plates is given 
by,
 
w = 1
2
k
m
where,
k = stiffness of spring (N/m)
m = mass of spring (kg)
For heavy-duty diesel engines, two concentric 
springs of different natural frequencies are used to 
eliminate the surge. In this case, the outer spring 
is designed to carry 60 to 70 per cent of maximum 
spring force on the combination and the inner spring 
is designed for the remaining force. One of the 
springs is wound in the right hand and other in the 
left hand to avoid interlocking.
Note The above analysis of valve spring is 
elementary. The valve spring is subjected to 
ﬂ uctuating loads. In IC engines, it is subjected to 
millions of stress cycles during its lifetime. They are 
designed as per the procedure explained in Example 
10.15 in Chapter10 on ‘Springs’.
25.32 DESIGN OF PUSH ROD
Push rods are used in overhead valve and side valve 
engines. It is a long column introduced between 
the cam and rocker arm so that the camshaft can be 
located at a lower level. The push rods are made of 
bright drawn steel tubes with 4% carbon or duralumin 
tubes. The ends of the push rod depend upon the 
general conﬁ guration of valve gear mechanism. 
912 Design of Machine Elements
When the push rod is guided, the ends are ﬂ at plugs. 
When the push rod is not guided, ball and socket 
joints are used at the ends. The ﬂ at plugs or sockets 
are force ﬁ tted at the ends of the push rod.
The push rod is designed as a column on the basis 
of buckling criterion. The slenderness ratio of push 
rod is such that it falls in the category of a ‘long’ 
column.
Suppose,
do = outer diameter of push rod (mm)
di = inner diameter of push rod (mm)
The ratio of (di/do) for push rod is 0.6 to 0.8.

Example 25.21 
Design a rocker arm for the 
exhaust valve of a four-stroke engine using the 
following data:
Design of IC Engine Components 913
Effective length of each arm = 180 mm
Angle between two arms = 135°
Diameter of valve head = 75 mm

atmosphere
The valve opens 33° before the outer dead 
centre and closes 1º after the inner dead centre. The 
motion of the valve is SHM without dwell in the fully 
opened condition. Assume suitable data and state the 
assumptions you make.

Outer diameter of eye = D2 = 2d2 = 2 (20)

Design of IC Engine Components 915
The diameter of the roller should be more than 
the outer diameter of the eye by at least 5 mm.
 Diameter of roller = 40 + 5 = 45  or  50 mm
When the roller pin is tight in the two eyes of 
the fork, failure occurs due to shear. On the other 
hand, when the pin is loose, it is subjected to 
bending moment. It acts as a beam as shown in 
Fig. 25.38. It is assumed that the load acting on the 
pin is uniformly distributed in the portion that is in 
contact with the roller. It is uniformly varying in two 
parts of the fork.

Step IV Design of cross-section of rocker arm
As shown in Fig. 25.39(a), the arm is subjected to 
bending moment under the action of the force Pe. 
We will consider the cross-section of arm near the 
boss of the fulcrum pin. The outside diameter of the 
boss of rocker arm at the fulcrum pin is twice the 
diameter of fulcrum pin (2d1). Therefore,
 Mb = Pe [a – d1] = 1926.39 [180 – 25]
 
= 298.59 ¥ 103 N-mm 
The proportions of cross-section for the rocker

 t3 = 2d = 2(10) = 20 mm 
Example 25.22 
Design a valve spring for the 
exhaust valve of a four-stroke engine using the 
following data:
Diameter of valve head = 75 mm
Lift of valve = 25 mm
Maximum suction pressure = 0.02 MPa below 
atmosphere
Stiffness of spring = 10 N/mm
Spring index = 8
Permissible torsional shear stress for spring wire

Modulus of rigidity = 84 ¥ 103 N/mm2
Total gap between consecutive coils, when the 
spring is subjected to maximum force, can be taken

Example 25.23 Design the valve gear mechanism 
for the exhaust valve of a horizontal diesel engine 
using the following data:
Cylinder bore = 250 mm
Length of stroke = 300 mm
Engine speed = 450 rpm
Maximum gas pressure = 3.5 MPa 
Effective length of each arm = 150 mm
Angle between two arms = 165°
Seat angle of valve = 45°
Mass of valve = 0.5 kg
Back pressure when the exhaust valve opens
= 0.4 MPa
Maximum suction pressure = 0.02 MPa (below 
atmosphere)
The valve opens 33° before outer dead centre 
and closes 1° after inner dead centre. The valve is 
to open and close with constant acceleration and 
deceleration for each half of the lift. Assume suitable 
data and state the assumptions you make. 
Solution
Given D = 250 mm l = 300 mm N = 450 rpm
pmax. = 3.5 MPa = 3.5 N/mm2 a = 150 mm
q = 165° m = 0.5 kg a = 45°
pc = 0.4 MPa = 0.4 N/mm2

(ii) Angle turned by camshaft per second

= (Number of revolutions/s)(360°)
            = 225

Ê

ˆ
¯˜ (

 In other words, 1350° of cam rotation takes 
1 second.
 (iii) Total crankshaft angle when the valve is 
open = 33 + 180 + 1 = 214°
 (iv) Total angle of cam action For four-stroke 
engine,
 
  angle of camshaft = 1
2  (angle of crankshaft)
 
  
= 1
2  (214) = 107°
 
 As shown in Fig. 25.41, during half of this 
rotation, the valve will open and in the 
remaining half, the valve will close. Therefore, 
cam rotation for valve opening is (107/2) or 
53.5°. Out of this, half the angle is occupied 
by constant acceleration and half the angle by 
constant deceleration. Therefore, cam rotation 
during the constant acceleration period is 
(53.5/2) or 26.75°. The valve lift is 27 mm. 
The valve will be raised by (27/2) or 13.5 mm 
during constant acceleration and 13.5 mm 
during the constant deceleration period.

The roller pin is ﬁ xed in the eye. The dimensions 
of the eye are as follows:
Thickness of each eye = l2/2 = 25/2 = 12.5 mm
Outer diameter of eye = D2 = 2d2 = 2(20)
 
= 40 mm
The diameter of the roller should be more than 
the outer diameter of the eye by at least 5 mm.
 Diameter of roller = 40 + 5 = 45  or  50 mm
When the roller pin is tight in the two eyes of 
the fork, failure occurs due to shear. On the other 
hand, when the pin is loose, it is subjected to 
bending moment. It acts as a beam as shown in 
Fig. 25.38. It is assumed that the load acting on the 
pin is uniformly distributed in the portion that is in 
contact with the roller. It is uniformly varying in two 
parts of the fork.
The bending moment is maximum at the central 
plane of the pin. From Eq. 25.89,

As shown in Fig. 25.39(a), the arm is subjected to 
bending moment under the action of the force Pe. 
We will consider the cross-section of the arm near 
the boss of the fulcrum pin. The outside diameter of 
the boss of the rocker arm at the fulcrum pin is twice 
the diameter of the fulcrum pin (2d1). Therefore,
 Mb = Pe [a – d1] = 2362 [150 – 30]

where,
 
D = cylinder bore (mm)
D¢ = 0.16D + 12.5 = 0.16 (250) + 12.5 
 
= 52.5 or 55 mm
The base circle diameter of the cam is at least
5 mm more than the camshaft diameter.
Base circle diameter of cam = 55 + 5 = 60 mm
The diameter of the roller is calculated in the

Displacement diagram
The displacement diagram is shown in Fig. 25.44. 
The step by step approach to construct this diagram 
is as follows:
Fig. 25.44 Displacement Diagram
 
(i) Draw a horizontal line OY. It represents the 
angular rotation of the cam when the valve 
opens, i.e., 53.5°. It is divided into two equal 
parts—OX and XY. The line OX indicates 
the constant acceleration phase (26.75°) and 
line XY represents the constant deceleration 
phase (26.75°).
 
(ii) Divide lines OX and XY each into four equal 
parts. The total of eight parts are shown by 
numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 8.  Each part represents 
(53.5º/8) or 6.6875º of cam rotation.
 (iii) Draw a vertical line YH equal to the valve 
lift, i.e., 27 mm.
 (iv) Draw ordinates through points 1, 2, 3, ……, 8.
 
(v) Draw a vertical line XZ equal to the valve lift 
(i.e., 27 mm). Divide the line XZ into eight 
equal parts. They are shown by points a, b, c, 
…, h. Therefore, each part represents (27/8) 
or 3.375 mm of the valve lift.
 (vi) Join lines Oa, Ob, Oc, Od that intersects the 
ordinates through 1, 2, 3 and 4 at points A, B,

Cam proﬁ le 
The proﬁ le of the cam is shown in Fig. 25.45. The 
step by step approach to construct this proﬁ le is as 
follows:
 
(i) Draw a base circle with O1 as centre and 
radius equal to 30 mm.
 
(ii) Draw a prime circle with O1 as centre and 
radius equal to (radius of base circle + radius 
of roller), i.e., (30 + 25) or 55 mm.
 (iii) Draw angle –OO1H equal to 53.5º. It 
represents the angular rotation of cam when 
the valve opens.
 (iv) Divide the angle –OO1H (53.5º) into eight 
equal parts. Therefore, each part represents 
(53.5º/8) or 6.6875º of cam rotation. The 
eight parts are shown by angles –O O11, 
–1O1 2, –2 O13, etc.

(v) Join points 1, 2, 3, etc., with the centre O1 
and extend the radial lines beyond the prime 
circle as shown in Fig. 25.45.
 (vi) Mark the distances 1A, 2B, 3C,… etc., 
from the displacement diagram shown in 
Fig. 25.44, on the extension of radial lines 
beyond the prime circle.
 (vii) Draw a smooth curve passing through points 
O, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. This curve is 
called the ‘pitch curve’.
 (viii) Draw circles with radii equal to the radius of 
the roller (25 mm) and centres at points O, A, 
B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. 
 (ix) The proﬁ le of the cam is a curve drawn 
tangential to these circles at the bottom as 
shown in Fig. 25.45. This curve indicates 
the cam proﬁ le when the valve is open. Only 
half the proﬁ le is drawn, but it is symmetrical 
about the line O1H.
