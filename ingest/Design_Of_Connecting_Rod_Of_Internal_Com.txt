ABSTRACT
This paper presents the design connecting rod of internal combustion engine using the
topology optimization. The objectives of this paper are to develop structural modeling,
finite element analyze and the optimization of the connecting rod for robust design. The
structure of connecting rod was modeled utilized SOLIDWORKS software. Finite
element
modeling
and
analysis
were
performed
using
MSC/PATRAN
and
MSC/NASTRAN software. Linear static analysis was carried out to obtain the
stress/strain state results. The mesh convergence analysis was performed to select the
best mesh for the analysis. The topology optimization technique is used to achieve the
objectives of optimization which is to reduce the weight of the connecting rod. From the
FEA analysis results, TET10 predicted higher maximum stress than TET4 and
maximum principal stress captured the maximum stress. The crank end is suggested to
be redesign based on the topology optimization results. The optimized connecting rod is
11.7% lighter and predicted low maximum stress compare to initial design. For future
research, the optimization should cover on material optimization to increase the strength
of the connecting rod.
Keywords: Topology optimization, connecting rod, finite element analysis, minimum

INTRODUCTION
Connecting
rods
are
highly
dynamically
loaded
components
used
for
power
transmission in combustion engines. The optimization of connecting rod had already
started as early year 1983 by Webster and his team. However, each day consumers are
looking for the best from the best. That’s why the optimization is really important
especially in automotive industry. Optimization of the component is to make the less
time to produce the product that is stronger, lighter and less cost. The design and weight
of the connecting rod influence on car performance. Hence, it is effect on the car
manufacture credibility. Change in the structural design and also material will be
significant increments in weight and performance of the engine. Mirehei et al. (2008)
were performed the study regarding the fatigue of connecting rod on universal tractor
(U650) by using ANSYS software application and the lifespan was estimated. The
authors also investigated that the stresses and hotspots experienced by the connecting
rod and the state of stress as well as stress concentration factors can be obtained and
156
consequently used for life predictions. Rahman et al. (2008a, 2009a) discuss about FEA
of the cylinder block of the free piston engine. The 4 nodes tetrahedral (TET4) element
version of the cylinder block was used for the initial analysis. The comparison then are
made between TET4 and 10 nodes tetrahedral (TET10) element mesh while using the
same global mesh length for the highest loading conditions (7.0 MPa) in the combustion
chamber.
A connecting rod is subjected to many millions of repetitive cyclic loadings.
Therefore, durability of this component is of critical importance. It is necessary to
investigate finite element modeling techniques, optimization techniques and new design
to reduce the weight at the same time increase the strength of the connecting rod itself.
Shenoy (2004) was explored the weight and cost reduction opportunities for a
production forged steel connecting rod. The study has dealt with two parts which are
dynamic load and quasi-dynamic stress analysis of the connecting rod, and second to
optimize the weight and cost. Shenoy and Fatemi (2005) were explained about
optimization study was performed on a steel forged connecting rod with a consideration
for improvement in weight and production cost. Weight reduction was achieved by
using an iterative procedure. In this study weight optimization is performed under a
cyclic load comprising dynamic tensile load and static compressive load as the two
extreme loads. Yang et al. (1992) describes a successful process for performing
component shape optimization should be focused on design modeling issues. A modular
software system is described and some of the modules are widely available commercial
programs such as MSC/PATRAN and MSC NASTRAN. The upper end (pin end) of a
connecting rod is optimized under a variety of initial assumptions to illustrate the use of
the system. The objectives of the study are to develop structural modeling of connecting
rod and perform finite element analysis of connecting rod. The main objective is to
develop topology optimization model of connecting rod.
OPTIMIZATION APPROACH
The objective of optimization technique is to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
and reduce the cost of production. The connecting rod subjected to tensile load at crank
end, while using factor of safety 3 as recommended by Shenoy (2004). The maximum
stress of the connecting rod monitored and make sure it is not over the allowable stress.
The load of the connecting rod optimized is comprised of the tensile load of 26.7 kN at
crank end. Linear buckling analysis was performed on the connecting is 26.7 kN. The
buckling load factor is considered also 3. The optimization technique methodology
flowchart is shown in Figure 1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents the details results of FE Analysis, selection of the mesh type and
influence of mesh type, identification of mesh convergence and optimization of the
connecting rod.
Finite Element Modeling and Analysis
The connecting rod is one of the most important components in the internal combustion
engine (Rasekh et al., 2009). Therefore, the initial design is compared to other design
before performing the optimization. A simple three-dimensional model of connecting
157
rod was developed using SOLIDWORKS software and finite element model was
created using TET10 as shown in Figure 2. Mesh study was performed on the FE model
to ensure sufficiently fines sizes are employed for accuracy of the calculated result
depends on the CPU time Rahman et al. (2009b,c). During the analysis, the specific
variable and the mesh convergence was monitored and evaluated. The mesh
convergence is based on the geometry, model topology and analysis objectives.

The uniformly distributed tensile load 180o on the inner surfaces of the crank end
while the other part, pin end is restrain as in Figure 3. It is just same when load
uniformly distributed on pin end surfaces, the crank end will restrain in all direction.
This both cases also work exactly in compressive load. In Figure 2, shows the boundary
condition of the connecting rod in three-dimensional FE model with load and
constraints. In this study four finite element models were analyzed. FEA for both tensile
and compressive loads were conducted. Two cases were analyzed for each case, Firstly,
load applied at the crank end and restrained at the piston pin end, and secondly, load
applied at the piston pin end and restrained at the crank end and the axial load was 26.7
kN in both tension and compression (Shenoy, 2004).

Influence of Mesh Type
The tetrahedral meshing approach is employed for the meshing of the solid region
geometry.
Tetrahedral
meshing
produces
high
quality
meshing
for
boundary
representation of solid structural model. Since the tetrahedral is found to be the best
meshing technique, TET4 was used for the initial analysis. The comparison then are
made between the TET4 and the 10 nodes tetrahedral (TET10) element mesh while
using the same global mesh length for the highest loading conditions (26.7 kN).
Material properties play an important role in the result of the FE analysis. The material
properties are one of the major inputs to perform the FEA and optimization. C-70 steel
is The mechanical properties of C-70 steel are shown in Table 1. From the results, it can
be found that the TET10 mesh predicted higher von Mises stresses than that TET4
meshes are known to be dreadfully stiff (Rahman et al., 2007, 2008b). TET4 employed
a linear order interpolation function while TET10 used quadratic order interpolation
function (Wang et al., 2004). For the same mesh size, TET10 is expected to be able to
capture the high stress concentration associated with the bolt holes. A TET10 was then
finally used for the solid mesh. Mesh study is performed on FE model to ensure
sufficiently fine sizes are employed for accuracy of calculated results but at
computational time (CPU time). Figure 4 shows the von-Mises stresses contour for
TET10 meshes element at a high load level. Table 2 shows that TET10 mesh predicts
higher von-Mises stresses than TET4 mesh. Specifically, TET10 mesh predicts the
highest von-Mises stresses is 301 MPa at mesh size 4 mm. The comparison was made
by using different length of mesh. Figure 5 and 6 show the variation of stress and
displacement over the global edge length and it can be seen that the TET10 is always
captured the higher values.

Identification of Mesh Convergence
The convergence of the stress was considered as the main criteria to select the mesh
type. The finite element mesh was generated using the TET10 for various mesh global
length. It can be seen from Figure 7 that mesh size of 4 mm is obtained largest stresses.
The smaller size less than 4 mm do not implemented due to the limitation of CPU time
and storage capacity of the computer. Hence, the maximum principal stress based on
TET10 at 4 mm mesh size is used in the analysis since the stress is higher compared to
von-Mises, Tresca and maximum principal stresses.
Figure 7: Stresses versus mesh size at critical location of for mesh convergence.
Optimization of Connecting Rod
The optimization of the connecting rod carried out using topology optimization
technique. The optimization focused on the uncritical sections which need to be
reduced. From the topology optimization, it is suggest the unnecessary shape and design
of the connecting rod. The optimization results are tabulated in Table 3 and the
objective function history are shown in Figure 8. The results of topology optimization of
the connecting rod are shown in Figure 9. The main objective is to minimize the weight
of the connecting rod as well as the total production cost. It can be seen that the
optimized model is reduce the weight from initial design until the value converges.
Figure 8 shows the objective function history of the optimization. The convergence of
the design is immediately after cycle no. 9. The implementation of these optimizations
is to find out the best design and topology of the connecting rod to improve the
performance and the strength especially at the critical location. The
possible
modification section of the optimized connecting rod is indicated in the figure. The
section with lower value than initial value considered as the suggestion to be optimized
in the new design. Table 4 shows the comparison between initial and optimize designs
on max principles stress and mass of the connecting rod. The optimize connecting rod
no 4 was choose as the best optimize design due to the lowest occurred stress and mass.
Even though the mass of the optimize connecting rod is not the lowest, but the decision
was also based on the maximum stress which is 320 MPa. Figure 10 shows the new
162
design of the connecting rod and mass of the connecting rod is 0.464 kg compare to
initial design 0.577 kg which is 11.7% lighter.

concluded that the weight of optimized design is 11.7% lighter and maximum stress
also predicted lower than the initial design of connecting rod. The results clearly
indicate that the new design much lighter and has more strength than initial design of
connecting rod. Material optimization approach will be considered for future research.
