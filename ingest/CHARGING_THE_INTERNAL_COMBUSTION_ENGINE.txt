Preface
Supercharging the reciprocating piston internal combustion engine is as old as the engine itself.
Early on, it was used to improve the high-altitude performance of aircraft engines and later to
increase the short-term peak performance in sporty or very expensive automobiles. It took nearly
30 years until it reached economic importance in the form of the efﬁciency-improving exhaust gas
turbocharging of slow- and medium-speed diesel engines. It took 30 more years until it entered
high-volume automotive engine production, in the form of both mechanically driven displacement
compressors and modern exhaust gas turbocharging systems.
Since, in spite of promising alternative developments for mobile applications, the internal
combustion engine will remain dominant for the foreseeable future, its further development is
essential. Today many demands are placed on automobile engines: on the one hand, consumers
insist on extreme efﬁciency, and on the other hand laws establish strict standards for, e.g., noise and
exhaust gas emissions. It would be extremely difﬁcult for an internal combustion engine to meet
these demands without the advantages afforded by supercharging. The purpose of this book is to
facilitate a better understanding of the characteristics of superchargers in respect to their physical
operating principles, as well as their interaction with piston engines. This applies both to the
displacement compressor and to exhaust gas turbocharging systems, which often are very complex.
It is not intended to cover the layout, calculation, and design of supercharging equipment as
such – this special area is reserved for the pertinent technical literature – but to cover those questions
which are important for an efﬁcient interaction between engine and supercharging system, as well
as the description of the tools necessary to obtain an optimal engine–supercharger combination.
Special emphasis is put on an understandable depiction of the interrelationships in as simple
a form as possible, as well as on the description and exempliﬁed in-depth discussion of modern
supercharging system development processes. As far as possible, the principal interactions are
described, and mathematical functions are limited to the necessary minimum, without at the same
time disregarding how indispensable simulation and layout programs today are for a fast, cost-
efﬁcient, and largely application-optimized engine–supercharger adaptation.
This book is written for students as well as engineers in research and development, whom we
presume to be signiﬁcantly more knowledgeable about the basics of the internal combustion engine
than about supercharging systems.
When compiling the bibliography, we – due to the extensive number of relevant publications
– have emphasized those texts which inﬂuence or support the descriptions and statements within
the book.

1 Introduction and short history
of supercharging
Very likely, the future of the internal combustion engine can be described within the energy-
sociopolitic environment as follows: For the foreseeable future, crude oil will still be the main
energy source for internal combustion engines in automotive and other mobile applications; natural
gas and, to a limited extent synthetic fuels (methanol and similar fuels), as well as, in the very
long run, hydrogen, will additionally gain in importance. Internal combustion engines for these
fuels are reciprocating or rotational piston combustion engines and gas and steam turbines. These
engines are employed, under consideration of the particular requirements and according to their
development status, in aircraft, locomotives, ships, stationary powerplants, and in road vehicles.
In aircraft design, the demand has always been for highest power density, i.e., smallest volume
and highest power-to-weight ratio. The reciprocating piston internal combustion engine was the
ﬁrst power source to fulﬁll these requirements. With this, it actually enabled the engine-powered
airplane and dominated this application until the end of the forties. Nowadays, with the exception
of applications in small airplanes, it is superseded by the gas turbine, which as propeller turbine or
as pure jet engine makes far higher power densities possible.
The classic power unit for train propulsion was the piston steam engine, which, in 2-, 3-, and
4-cylinder designs, lasted the longest for this use. Today, the steam locomotive is superseded by
the electric or by the diesel locomotive, where diesel traction is more efﬁcient for long hauls and
stretches on which trains run infrequently. Diesel engines of high power density with hydraulic or
electric power transfer today dominate diesel locomotive design. Repeatedly, the gas turbine was
tested for this application – also as a short-time booster power unit – but could not prevail due to
fuel economy and durability reasons.
In ship building, after the classic piston steam engine, ﬁrst the steam turbine and then the
gas turbine seemed to best accommodate the highly increasing power demands. In fast ships,
also warships, where fuel consumption and fuel quality are not as decisive as power density and
performance, the gas turbine even today occupies a niche market. But the highly supercharged,
high-speed diesel engine, mostly in multiple engine conﬁguration, is capturing this market to an
increasing degree. In merchant shipping, due to its good fuel economy and the possibility to use
even the cheapest heavy oils, the medium-speed and the slow-speed diesel heavy-oil engine have
penetrated the market widely.
In large power plants with an output of 100MW or more, the steam turbine still dominates. The
extent to which smaller, decentralized electric power generating or heat and power cogeneration
plants with internal combustion engines can take hold, remains to be seen. To cover peak power
demands, the gas turbine has gained increased importance for this application.

Introduction
For passenger cars as well as for trucks nowadays practically only the high-speed internal
combustion engine is used, for reasons of its power density, durability, and cost, but especially
for its ease of control and its ﬂexibility in transient operation. Additionally, in the last decade
extensive development work has led to reduced exhaust emissions with simultaneously improved
efﬁciency. For truck engines, exhaust gas turbocharging in combination with charge air cooling has
contributed decisively to attain both goals. From the heaviest truck down to transporters with about
4-tons payload, today practically only the exhaust gas turbocharged, charge air cooled, direct-
injection diesel engine is used. In passenger cars as well, this engine conﬁguration is gaining
increased importance due to its extraordinary efﬁciency. In regard to supercharging, the passenger
car gasoline engine remains problematical, due to its high exhaust gas temperature as well as to the
requirement that an acceptable driving performance must be attained. This even more since also
very narrow cost targets have to be met. But also here new approaches to technical solutions can
be observed, so that it can be presumed that in 10 to 20 years supercharged combustion engines
will totally dominate the market.
The history of supercharging the internal combustion engine reaches back to Gottlieb Daimler
and Rudolf Diesel themselves.
Supercharging the high-speed gasoline engine is as old as it itself. Already Gottlieb Daimler
had supercharged his ﬁrst engines, as his patent drp 34926 obtained in 1885 shows (Fig.1.1). In
this case, the piston’s bottom was used, which in the four-stroke engine works as a mixture pump
with double work-cycle frequency and therefore delivers a greater mixture volume than the work
cylinder could aspirate.
Transferring the charge from the crankcase cavity into the work cylinder was performed by
a valve in the piston bottom. The reason for Daimler’s bold design was his desire for a possible
speed and charge increase of the engines, despite the fact that at that time only very small intake
and exhaust valves were feasible. The problems, especially with the piston bottom valve, however
soon forced Daimler to abandon this intrinsically correct idea in favor of larger valves as well as
the application of multiple-valve cylinder heads, which were designed by his co-worker Maybach.
Supercharging found its ﬁrst series application in aircraft engines, especially to increase high-
altitude performance. In the years from 1920 to 1940, turbo compressors were continuously im-
proved, in aerodynamics as well as in the circumferential speed of the impellers.
Supercharging of gasoline engines experienced its ﬁrst absolute peak in regard to power and
high-altitude performance increases in aircraft engines during World War II. Brake mean effective
pressure values of up to 23bar were reached with mechanically powered turbo compressors. The
last u.s. gasoline aircraft engines were the ﬁrst series production compound engines, such as the
18-cylinder dual-radial compound engine from Curtiss Wright with a takeoff power of 2420kW
(see Fig.6.22).
From about 1920, automotive supercharged engines for racing, but also for the short-term power
increase of sport and luxury vehicles, were equipped with mechanically powered and engageable
displacement compressors. In most cases they were one- or two-stage Roots blowers. Figure1.2
shows such a passenger car engine with 40/60hp from 2.6 liter displacement, built in 1921 by
Daimler.
Exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engines were ﬁrst introduced into the u.s. market around
1960, e.g., the Chevrolet Corvair [76]. For the supercharging of gasoline engines, the big break-
through towards large-scale series production, with the exception of use in airplanes, only happened
veryrecently,with,e.g.,the2.3litercompressorenginefromDaimlerChryslerinitsslkandCclass,
or the exhaust gas turbocharged engines from Audi, Opel, and Saab.

Rudolf Diesel also got involved with supercharging very early, as his patent drp 95680
demonstrates (Fig.1.3). In his cross-head engine he used the piston bottom as a two-stroke charge
pump. This patent also describes a process for cooling the air in a downstream plenum.
With his layout, Diesel achieved a power increase of 30%. However, since he was primarily
concerned about the efﬁciency of his engine and it dramatically deteriorated – due to a totally
incorrect size of the intake valve and the downstream plenum, he stopped these tests. This type of

supercharging was, with correct dimensioning of the components, very successfully used 30 years
later in marine diesel engines (e.g., by Werkspoor).
The development of exhaust gas turbocharging is closely connected with the name and patents
of the Swiss engineer Alfred Buechi. As early as 1905, in patent drp 204630 (Fig.1.4) he described
a turbocompound diesel engine – although not meaningful in the proposed form. But it still took
until 1925 for the ﬁrst exhaust gas turbocharged diesel engines to be introduced into the market,
in the form of engines for two passenger ships and one stationary diesel engine from man and the
Maschinenfabrik Winterthur. In both cases, the exhaust gas turbochargers were still located beside
the engine. All chargers were designed by Buechi.
In the man marine engines, the mean effective pressure was increased by 40% to 11 bar, and
important insights were gained:
Exhaust gas turbocharged engines are very overload capable.
The turbocharger group controls itself during operation.
In order to overcome the problem of a negative pressure gradient between charge pressure and
exhaust gas backpressure, i.e., a negative scavenging gradient, which happened with these early
exhaust gas turbochargers due to their low overall efﬁciency, in 1925 Buechi applied for another
patent for a pressure-wave or pulse-charging layout. This was to be achieved by separating the
exhaust manifolds and combining the cylinders with ignition intervals of more than 240◦crank
angle, as well as narrow exhaust manifold areas (Fig.1.5).
The ﬁrst tests at the Schweizer Lokomotiv- and Maschinenfabrik Winterthur on a 4- and a
6-cylinder engine with bbc charger were very promising. A power increase of 100% could be
achieved with good thermodynamic results, and a third insight was gained:
Exhaust manifolds not only must have a small area but also must be as short as possible.
With that, ﬂow and heat losses are minimized. Consequently, today exhaust gas turbochargers are
mounted directly on the engine as a part of the exhaust manifold. Since then, the system described
has been called Buechi-charging and is the basis for the exhaust gas turbocharging of all automotive
engines.
2 Basic principles and objectives
of supercharging
The objective of supercharging is to increase the charge density of the working medium (air or
air-fuel mixture), by any means and with the help of a suitable system, before it enters the work
cylinder, i.e., to precompress the charge. In doing so, the temperature of the working medium
should not be markedly raised, since this would adversely inﬂuence the temperature proﬁle of the
high-pressure work cycle.
The density increase of the working medium increases the power density and can also be used to
improve the combustion process with the aim to achieve lower exhaust gas and/or noise emissions.
The interrelationships between mean effective pressure or power output and density of the cylinder
air or mixture charge will be discussed below.
2.1 Interrelationship between cylinder charge and cylinder work
as well as between charge mass ﬂow and engine power output
In all internal combustion engines, work and power are generated through the transformation of the
chemical energy stored in the fuel via combustion or oxidation and subsequent conversion of the
heat energy into mechanical energy. The oxygen necessary for the combustion is extracted from
the air introduced into the working chamber. Therefore, the power output of any internal combustion
engine in which the processed air is used as combustion partner for the fuel, depends on the air
quantity present in the cylinder.
2.1.1 Interrelationship between cylinder charge and cylinder work
The air-aspirating reciprocating piston engine is a volume pump and the maximum amount of air
volume that can be introduced into the cylinder is
VA = Vcyl and mA = VcylρA,cyl.
(2.1)
The cylinder air charge, multiplied by the density of the air, results in the cylinder air mass, which
determines the fuel mass that can be combusted in it and with which work can be gained via the
increases in pressure and temperature taking place during combustion.
On the one hand, the indicated work Wi in the cylinder is the product of force times displacement
as well as of the piston-area times stroke times pressure,
Wi =
d2
cylπ

SPimep.
(2.2)
6
Basic principles and objectives of supercharging
On the other hand, work is the product of added heat quantity times process efﬁciency,
Wi = Qadd,cylηi,
(2.3)
where Qadd,cyl is the added heat quantity per cylinder charge, and ηi is the process efﬁciency, itself
the quotient of mechanical work and added heat energy.
The heat quantity that can be added to the cylinder depends on the amount of fuel that is
introduced into it, and that again depends on the amount of oxygen present in the cylinder. The
amount of oxygen stands in a ﬁxed relation to the air mass in the cylinder – and not to the cylinder
volume. If we simplify and neither consider the incomplete charge of the cylinder, the volumetric
efﬁciency, nor excess air that may be necessary for combustion, this heat quantity will be
Qadd,cyl = mFQlow = VcylρA,cylQlow
Amin
,
(2.4)
where mF is the added fuel quantity, Amin the minimum air requirement, Qlow the net caloriﬁc
value of the fuel, and ρA,cyl is the air density in the cylinder.
Keeping Qlow and Amin constant, it is directly derived that
Qadd,cyl ∼ρA,cyl.
(2.5)
The air mass mA,cyl in the cylinder is directly proportional to the air density ρA,cyl, so that also
the heat quantity that can be added is directly proportional to this air mass in the cylinder and
consequently must approximate the charge density of the engine. With this, the cylinder work in a
given engine is directly dependent on the density of the air in the working cylinder at the end of
the intake stroke and gas exchange.
Combining the equations above results in
Vcylimep = VcylρA,cylQlowηi
Amin
,
(2.6)
with the consequence
imep ∼ρA,cyl.
(2.7)
Therefore, with the internal efﬁciency considered constant (i.e., unchanged combustion process and
unchanged losses in the high-pressure process), the medium indicated pressure of a work cylinder
is proportional to the charge density in the cylinder at the beginning of the compression stroke.
2.1.2 Interrelationship between charge mass ﬂow and engine power output
After the cylinder work has been determined, the engine power output can easily be related to the
air mass ﬂow. It must be proportional to the swept volume of the whole engine (according to the
total number of its work cylinders) as well as, depending on the working process, the number of
power cycles in a given time.
Pi = VtotimepnWC,
(2.8)
where Vtot is the displacement of the engine, imep the indicated mean effective pressure, and nWC
the number of working cycles. The latter still has to be deﬁned in detail. Only in a two-stroke
2.1 Cylinder charge and cylinder work, charge mass ﬂow and engine power output
7
engine, where every revolution represents a working cycle, is it identical to the measured speed. If
we introduce an index i between the number of engine revolutions n and the number of working
cycles nWC, for a two-stroke engine, i = n/nWC = 1. In the four-stroke engine, on the other hand,
combustion takes place during every second revolution only, and therefore in a four-stroke engine,
i = n/nWC = 2.
With this, the indicated engine power output can be determined as follows:
Pi = Vtotimep n
i ,
where Vtot = ncylVcyl.
(2.9)
Including the proportionality of imep and ρA,cyl, we ﬁnd:
Pi ∼VtotρA,cyl
n
i
or
Pi ∼˙mA,cyl.
(2.10)
We now have tied the engine power output to the air mass ﬂow through the engine.
If an internal combustion engine is supposed to generate power output for more than a single
work cycle, the exhaust gas has to be removed from the cylinder and after each such work cycle be
replaced with fresh air in the case of a diesel engine or fresh mixture in the case of a gasoline engine.
In the ideal engine, which we have looked at up to now, this happens without losses and
completely. For the real engine, the gas exchange process has to be described in more detail. It is
important since it inﬂuences the engine characteristics considerably. The following requirements
apply for the layout of the gas exchange:
–
the exhaust gas present in the cylinder at the end of the working stroke has to be removed as
completely as possible,
–
the fresh air or fresh charge quantity required must be exactly prepared to the requirements of
the engine, e.g., regarding cooling or exhaust gas quality,
–
the aspirated fresh charge must ﬁll the cylinder as completely as possible.
In practice, this means that the total fresh charge mass ﬂowing into the cylinder, mIn, and the fresh
charge mass remaining in the cylinder, mfA, usually are not identical. They differ by that fraction of
charge mass which, during the simultaneous opening of the inlet and exhaust devices (the so-called
overlap period), without participating in the combustion, directly ﬂows into the exhaust, i.e., the
scavenging mass mS.
mS = min −mfA.
(2.11)
In a naturally aspirating four-stroke engine, due to the small valve areas during the overlap period,
the scavenging mass is insigniﬁcant. In most cases it is also not very signiﬁcant in supercharged
engines with a larger valve overlap. In some engine types (medium-speed supercharged natural gas
engines as well as large slow-speed two-stroke engines), the scavenging air portion is systematically
used to cool the combustion chamber. For that it is necessary to generate a positive pressure
gradient throughout the engine (high turbocharger efﬁciencies), which results in larger scavenging
air quantities during valve overlap. Especially since supercharging is common today, in two-stroke
engines with their very large overlap areas of the gas exchange control devices, a careful layout and
design is very important for the optimization of the scavenging process. Altogether, in a two-stroke
engine an attempt must be made to achieve a good gas exchange with small scavenging air masses,
so that the exhaust gas mass remaining in the cylinder, mRG, stays as small as possible. Exhaust

Basic principles and objectives of supercharging
gas mass and the fresh mixture mass remaining in the cylinder per cycle, mfA, thus constitute the
cylinder charge mass mcyl which is in the cylinder at the beginning of compression,
mcyl = mfA + mRG.
(2.12)
The exhaust gas mass mEx exiting into the exhaust per work cycle also contains the scavenging mass
directly scavenged into the exhaust manifold during the overlap period, and for the mixture-as-
pirating gasoline engine, it is identical to the inﬂowing fresh charge mass. In the air-aspirating diesel
engine it is larger than the aspirated air mass by the amount of injected fuel mass mF per work cycle,
mEx = mIn + mF.
(2.13)
2.2 Inﬂuence of charge air cooling
Independent of its design, in any compressor the compression of the intake air results in a
temperature increase, which primarily depends on the desired pressure ratio, i.e., the supercharging
factor, and the compressor efﬁciency:
T2 = T1


ηs-i,C

.
(2.14)
Here, T1 and T2 represent the temperatures upstream and downstream of the compressor in kelvin,
ηs-i,C the isentropic compressor efﬁciency, and p1 and p2 the pressures upstream and downstream
of the compressor.
At constant charge pressure, this temperature increase diminishes the inﬂowing fresh charge
corresponding to the density change caused by it, and downstream causes higher process
temperatures with all its associated disadvantages.
As an example for the efﬁciency of charge air cooling, let us consider an ideal engine with the
following characteristics:
intake pressure p1 = 1 bar
charge pressure ratio p2/p1 = 2.5
intake temperature T1 = 293 K (20 ◦C)
compressor efﬁciency ηs-i,C = 0.70
This results in a ﬁnal charge temperature of T2 = 418 K (145 ◦C).
In the following comparison, the combustion air ratio is kept constant, i.e., the fuel mass and
with it the power output are determined according to the charge mass.
With above data, the aspirated engine has the air density
ρ1 = ρ2 = 1.19 kg/m3 (=100%).
The supercharged engine without charge air cooling has the charge density
ρ2 = 2.09 kg/m3 (=175%).
The charge air cooled engine with a cool-down to 40 ◦C enables a density increase to
ρ2 = 2.78 kg/m3 (=234%).
In this example, we see the enormous effect of charge air cooling, since at a constant pressure ratio
a density increase of 2.78/2.09, i.e., an increase of 33% is obtained, combined with a process start
temperature which is about 190 ◦C lower.
Charge air cooling therefore has the following advantages:
–
a further power increase of supercharged engines at constant pressure ratio due to the increased
charge density;

–
a lower charge temperature at process start with lower process temperatures, resulting in lower
thermal stress for the components;
–
lower NOx emissions due to the lower process temperatures;
–
a decisive improvement in the knocking tendency of supercharged gasoline engines; only with
charge air cooling, gasoline engines can achieve acceptable fuel consumption.
2.3 Deﬁnitions and survey of supercharging methods
Here we will deﬁne possible types of pre-compression processes and the characteristic properties
of chargers or compressors.
Supercharging by means of gasdynamic effects
–
The exploitation of the pressure waves in the intake and exhaust systems via pulse or variable
intake systems and tuned exhaust manifold lengths
–
Supercharging via Helmholtz resonator intake manifold layouts
–
Pressure-wave charging via direct pressure exchange between exhaust gas and charge air
(Comprex, register-resonance charger)
Supercharging with mechanically driven chargers
–
Displacement or rotary piston charger without internal compression (e.g., Roots blower)
–
Displacement or screw-type charger with internal compression (Lysholm, Wankel, spiral
charger)
–
Turbo compressors (radial compressor, axial compressor)
Supercharging systems with exhaust gas energy recovery
–
Coupling a turbo compressor with a turbine – both located on the same shaft –, called an exhaust
gas turbocharger
–
Coupling of a displacement compressor with an expander located on the same shaft (Wankel)
Supercharging via combination of the components mentioned above
–
Turbocompound system, consisting of an exhaust gas turbocharger with downstream energy
recovery turbine
–
Combined systems of resonance charger and exhaust gas turbocharger
–
Combination of a mechanical charger with an exhaust gas turbocharger
2.4 Supercharging by means of gasdynamic effects
We begin our detailed examination of the various supercharging possibilities with the widely used
pressure wave charging via pulse or variable intake systems. In addition, with the help of tuned
exhaust pipe lengths during the overlap period a lower pressure can be achieved in the exhaust
system than in the cylinder; this results in an improved scavenge process of the residual gas. Lastly,
increases in volumetric efﬁciency are possible via so-called resonance charging with Helmholtz
resonator and resonance manifold combinations (Cser supercharging).
2.4.1 Intake manifold resonance charging
This type of precompression uses the dynamics of the pressure waves in the intake and exhaust
manifolds of high-speed engines. It is therefore a dynamic pressure increase in the intake system
without the use of a compressor.

The periodical opening of the intake and exhaust valves of a reciprocating piston engine excites
the corresponding gas columns in the intake and exhaust manifolds, which results, depending on
the phase position, frequency and engine speed, in manifold pressures at the valves which are
signiﬁcantly different from the ambient pressure. With every opening of the intake or exhaust valve
a lower or higher pressure wave enters into the corresponding manifold system and is reﬂected at
its end (manifold or mufﬂer) as a high or low pressure wave (Fig. 2.1) respectively.
If the lengths of the intake and exhaust manifolds are tuned correctly, shortly before “intake
closes” a higher pressure wave arrives at the intake valve, which increases the pressure in the
combustion chamber. Correspondingly, shortly after “intake opens” and before “exhaust closes”,
intheso-calledvalveoverlapphase,alowerpressurewavereachestheexhaustvalveandthuscreates
a positive scavenging gradient relative to the intake manifold, with corresponding improvement of
the combustion chamber scavenging process or an improved expulsion of remaining exhaust gases.
Physically the aspirating work of the piston is transformed into compression work. Both effects

combined are preferred in sports or racing engines, since in those the necessary wave propagation
time, due to the very high engine speed, is shortened and with that also the necessary manifold
length. Figure 2.2 shows a sports engine (Ferrari) with pulse intake manifolds. If the exhaust system
is also included in this pulse tuning – as is usual in today’s racing engines – air delivery ratios of
maximum 1.25–1.3 and a signiﬁcant charging effect are achieved.
On the intake side, today so-called variable intake systems are frequently used for series
production engines, which operate with variable reﬂection lengths, as shown in Fig. 2.3 with the
three-stage Opel intake manifold as an example. This layout increases the volumetric efﬁciency in
the lower speed range and improves the torque curve in the medium speed range. Additionally, a
rise in volumetric efﬁciency is gained in the area of rated horsepower.
In any case, with all these systems the gas cycle work is increased, because – due to the
generation of the aspirating wave in the intake system – the pressure in the cylinder is decreasing
further than with regular intake manifold layouts. Figure 2.4 shows this effect in the pV diagram.
With the possibility of a continuous adjustment of the intake manifold length (e.g., in Formula 1),
an increase in volumetric efﬁciency can be achieved in the entire full load speed range.
2.4.2 Helmholtz resonance charging
To obtain Helmholtz resonance charging, a plenum-manifold system (Helmholtz resonator) is
connected to the intake side to several cylinders, with a layout in which the aspiration cycle periods
of these cylinders correspond to the eigenfrequency of the plenum-manifold system. With this

arrangement, supercharging is obtained at the resonance speed or in a limited speed range. The
disadvantage of this layout is that, if it is not designed variable (Fig. 2.5), the intended volumetric
efﬁciency increase in the lower speed range is reached only with a loss in the upper speed range.
This disadvantage can be mostly avoided if the layout is made switchable via a simple blocking
valve in the charge air manifold (Fig. 2.6a).
Figure 2.6b shows in principle the volumetric efﬁciency curves of a standard charging manifold
system compared with a ﬁxed and a switched resonance charging system.
The layout and optimization of the gasdynamic systems described here is usually done on the
basis of numeric cycle simulations, which allow the evaluation of the system variants so that the
most promising can be selected and optimized. Before such systems are optimized on an engine
test bench – especially in combination with a suitable control algorithm – it is advantageous to
ﬁrst evaluate complex three-dimensional assemblies in the course of their detailed design in view
of gasdynamic behavior with the aid of 3-D cfd (computational ﬂuid dynamics) simulations. The
3-D simulation area may be evaluated independently of the complete engine, where the boundary
conditions for the simulation can be provided by the above mentioned cycle calculations. On
the other hand, if it is necessary to take the retroactive effects of the 3-D simulation area on the
operation characteristics of the complete engine into consideration [40] (e.g., distribution of ex-
haust gas recirculation in an air plenum), various commercial software systems offer the possibility
of a direct integration of the cfd simulation area into the thermodynamic engine simulation model
(avl-boost/fire, wave/star-cd, gt-power/vectis).
2.5 Supercharging with supercharging units
The various compressor principles were already mentioned in Sect. 2.3. However, it is important
to note that compressors basically can be divided into the following two categories, depending on
the mechanisms employed to compress the gas:
–
displacement type superchargers, e.g., reciprocating piston, rotary piston and rotating piston
chargers
–
ﬂow type superchargers, e.g., turbo machineries such as radial and axial compressors
The displacement type compressors or chargers can additionally be distinguished by their working
principle, i.e., whether they use internal compression (e.g., reciprocating piston compressor) or
simple gas delivery without internal compression (e.g., Roots blower). As is shown in Fig. 2.7,
the use of internal compression can reduce the speciﬁc work needed for gas compression,
which signiﬁcantly improves compressor efﬁciency, especially at higher pressure ratios. Today,
applications with relatively low compression ratios up to 1:1.7 are widespread. However, up to this
pressure ratio the advantage gained by internal compression is relatively small. On the other hand,
charger designs without internal compression (e.g., Roots blower) can be manufactured more
easily and therefore are more cost efﬁcient, which is the reason why this design is often preferred.
2.5.1 Charger pressure–volume ﬂow map
The behavior of the supercharger designs discussed here can be best explained in a pressure–volume
ﬂow map (Fig. 2.8), in which are plotted
–
on the x-coordinate the pumped volume ﬂow and thus the mass ﬂow,
–
on the y-coordinate the pressure ratio of the particular compressor.

Customarily this map is augmented by
–
curves with constant charger speed,
–
curves of constant isentropic or total efﬁciencies.
Although the various layouts and design principles strongly affect the performance map, it
allows us to show and compare the characteristics of displacement and turbo compressors very well.
2.5.2 Displacement compressor
The simplest example of this design is the reciprocating piston charger, which, however, nowadays
is only used for slow-speed two-stroke engines in parallel or series layout with the exhaust gas
turbocharger. But it is very well suited to deduct the characteristics in the performance map.
With the help of the pV diagram for this charger type we will discuss the effects on its efﬁciency
and inﬂuences of the real process management on the compressor work. Figure 2.9 shows the pV
diagram of a reciprocating piston compressor. Here we clearly see the inﬂuence of the dead space
and the value of the desired boost pressure on the real intake volumes and therefore the delivery

quantity. The charging efﬁciency and with it the delivery quantity thus decrease with increasing
pressure.
An example of a real pressure–volume ﬂow map of a displacement compressor is shown in
Fig. 2.10. For all displacement compressors the volume ﬂow decreases, with increasing boost
pressure p2, and therefore the volume ﬂow curves in the map at constant speeds are slightly tilted
to the left. The curves showing the efﬁciency ηs-i or ηtot strongly depend on the charger type.
The map characteristic shown above is very similar to that of the rotating piston chargers which
are commonly used today because of their small installation space and cost advantages, as well
as to that of rotary (Wankel) chargers, Roots blowers, and the Lysholm screw-type compressor.
However, since the Roots blower cannot offer internal compression, it should primarily be used
for applications with low boost pressure.
It must be pointed out that all displacement compressors, in contrast to ﬂow compressors, more
or less deliver discontinuously. Depending on the degree of internal compression, they therefore
cause pressure waves in the charge air manifolds, which results in uneven cylinder volumetric
efﬁciencies or can lead to noise problems in the engines.
The characteristics of displacement compressors can be summarized as follows.
There is no unstable area in the pressure–volume ﬂow diagram, i.e., the total delivery range
indicated by the charger dimensions (Vcyl and n) can be utilized.
The achievable pressure ratio is independent of the supercharger speed. But it is decisively
dependent on the design conditions, such as dead volume, leakage, installed size, and design type.
Nowadays, p2/p1 reaches actual values of 1.8–2.
Relatively steep characteristics are obtained for constant charger speeds, i.e., with increasing
boost pressure they are slightly tilted to the left.
This behavior inﬂuences and naturally affects the control strategies of such charging systems,
because with boost pressure changes, only small increases or decreases in delivery quantities are
achieved. This can be easily controlled, e.g., via a simple ﬂow bypass.
The delivery quantities achievable are approximately proportional to the charger displacement.
At constant pressure ratio, the delivery quantity is approximately proportional to the charger
speed.
2.5.3 Turbo compressor
For applications with reciprocating piston engines, the most important turbo compressor is the
radial compressor, which derives its name from the radial exit direction of the delivery medium
out of the compressor impeller. The intake of the delivery medium occurs axially.
16
Basic principles and objectives of supercharging
Since the radial compressor will be discussed in detail in Chap. 5 in connection with exhaust
gas turbocharging and as part of the exhaust gas turbocharger, at this point its function will only
be addressed as the basis for its map characteristics.
All ﬂow compressors are based on the physical principle of the transformation of kinetic
energy, which is supplied to the medium in the impeller, into a pressure rise via ﬂow deceleration,
partially in the impeller, partially in a diffuser. The complete process between compressor inlet
and outlet can be clearly described using the ﬁrst thermodynamic theorem for open systems:
wC = v2
2
2 −v2
1
2 + h2 −h1,
(2.15)
where wC is the added speciﬁc compressor work, vi are the medium absolute ﬂow speeds at
the intake (1) and outlet (2), and hi are the corresponding enthalpies. The latter describe the gas
condition, which enables, directly from Eq. (2.15), the calculation of the pressure and temperature
at the compressor outlet or the compressor work.
The danger of ﬂow stalling exists in the ﬂow compressor, as in the diffuser. Therefore, in a
single compressor stage, only a limited pressure ratio can be achieved. Since the radial compressor
enables the highest per-stage pressure ratios, it is the preferred choice for a compressor in exhaust
gas turbochargers. In this layout, the chargers can be of very compact design. Their disadvantage
in comparison to axial compressors is lower efﬁciency.
From all these facts it is clear that ﬂow compressors show totally different map characteristics
compared with displacement compressors.
Additionally, all turbo compressors deliver continuously, except for the speed ﬂuctuation at
the compressor impeller exit caused by the ﬁnite blade thicknesses. Although they thus generally
feature a better acoustic quality, radial compressors are also sometimes equipped with silencer
systems to eliminate these high-frequency noise excitations.
The map characteristics of turbo compressors can, then, be predicted as follows (Fig. 2.11).
There is an unstable area in the delivery map, which is located in the left sector of low ﬂow
rates and which widens at higher pressure ratios. The pressure ratio obtainable also depends on the
delivery quantity. The borderline between stable and unstable delivery is called the surge limit.
The achievable pressure ratio will be about proportional to the speed squared and will thus
be limited by the maximum possible charger speed and by the maximum circumferential speed,
which itself is determined by the mechanical rigidity of the impeller.

2.6 Interaction between supercharger and internal combustion engine
17
The characteristic curves of constant charger speed reach the same pressure ratio in a wide
range, and thus they run horizontally despite different delivery quantity. The achievable pressure
ratio will decrease only with further increasing ﬂow rates, due to incorrect ﬂow into the impeller and,
if installed, diffuser blades. The speed curves drop in an increasingly steep decline to a maximum
ﬂow rate value without pressure increase. This maximum value, also called choke limit, is attained
when the speed of sound is reached at the compressor intake.
It is important to note that in a turbo compressor, contrary to a displacement compressor, a
pressure increase must always be associated with a speed increase, and the maximum pressure
ratio is always reached at maximum speed of the compressor.
With this, the essential characteristics of displacement compressors and ﬂow compres-
sors are deﬁned, so that now the interaction with a reciprocating piston combustion engine can be
examined.
2.6 Interaction between supercharger and internal combustion engine
In order to be able to evaluate the interaction between the charger and the reciprocating piston
engine, it is necessary to develop the engine map similar to the charger map, i.e., how its air ﬂow
depends on engine speed and charge pressure.
2.6.1 Pressure–volume ﬂow map of the piston engine
In the pressure–volume ﬂow map of the engine (Fig. 2.12), the x-coordinate also represents the
volume ﬂow or the mass ﬂow rate through the engine, and on the y-coordinate the pressure ratio
between cylinder and outside pressure at the start of compression is plotted.
Therefore, it is also of practical use to reference this engine map, that is, its pressure–
volume ﬂow diagram, to the state at charger intake. Since in this scale the pressure–
volume ﬂow map of the charger (or the supercharging system) and that of the engine (to be
supercharged) are identical, the interaction between charger and engine can be shown and evaluated
in it.
Two-stroke engine
The two-stroke engine has a relatively simple map, since both inlet and exhaust are open
simultaneously for extended periods of its gas exchange, i.e., around the bottom dead center.
This causes a ﬂow-through or scavenge process which can be described rather easily. The inlet

and exhaust port areas are substituted with a so-called equivalent area, which can be calculated as
follows:

(2.16)
where AIn describes the intake port area, AEx the exhaust port area, and Ared is the equivalent port
area. Further, a common ﬂow coefﬁcient µred is deﬁned in such a way that it results in the same ﬂow
resistance as the series-connected inlet and exhaust areas. When the equivalent port area ∫Ared dϕ
is integrated over the engine cycle, which is 360◦crank angle in the case of the two-stroke engine,
the mass ﬂow function describes the volume ﬂow map:

(2.18)
where µred is the ﬂow coefﬁcient associated with the equivalent area Ared, p2 the charge or scavenge
pressure, and p3 the exhaust backpressure at the engine ﬂange.
As can be seen from Eqs. (2.17) and (2.18), the scavenged air or mixture mass depends only
on the backpressure at the exhaust port p3 and the supercharger efﬁciency ηTC, at given geometric
relations of the gas exchange ports and at a certain boost pressure (which inﬂuences the charge
density via T2).
Additionally,iftheinﬂuenceofthespeed-dependentpulsationintheinletandexhaustmanifolds
on the pressure upstream and downstream of the equivalent area Ared is neglected, there is no
difference if, within a cycle’s time period, the ports are opened seldom slowly or often rapidly.
This results in an approximately speed-independent air or mixture mass ﬂow and therefore, at a
given backpressure, one singular engine operating curve only. Figure 2.13 schematically shows
the volume ﬂow through a two-stroke engine, depending on the boost pressure ratio p2/p1 and
the backpressure p3 as parameters. For a speciﬁed power output, a speciﬁc air or mixture volume
ﬂow ˙V 1 is needed. However, if the pressure pEx in the exhaust manifold changes, differing boost
pressures or boost pressure ratios must compensate for this to maintain the necessary pressure
gradient between inlet and exhaust, i.e., to assure ˙V 1 under all conditions.
The bold line shown in Fig. 2.13 schematically represents the operating curve of a two-stroke
engine with exhaust gas turbocharging. With this type of supercharging, the exhaust backpressure
increases with increasing boost pressure, which is the reason for the steeper slope of the curve
compared to the case with constant backpressures obtained with mechanical supercharging.
Four-stroke engine
During the gas exchange process, the four-stroke engine works as a displacement compressor.
Therefore, its volume ﬂow is also calculated based on speed, swept volume, volumetric efﬁciency,
and density ratio. However, its swallowing characteristics show a behavior contrary to that of a
turbine: The volume ﬂow increases with increasing boost pressure, since aspiration takes place
at the precompression pressure p2. This is why in this map the swallowing-capacity functions
for constant engine speed are tilted to the right. For the four-stroke engine, the volume ﬂow is

In addition to the equation for the two-stroke engine, here λvol designates the volumetric efﬁciency.

be calculated with good approximation by the following, empirical, equation:

(2.20)
where ε is the compression ratio, T2 is the temperature upstream of the inlet valve in kelvin, and
t2 in degrees Celsius. The function takes into account the fact that with valve overlap there is
no reverse expansion of the residual gases, and it considers the heating of the charge air during
the intake process. The ﬁrst term of Eq. (2.19) is proportional to the engine speed, the second is
dependent on the pressure ratio and the valve overlap, which is addressed via Ared. A map of a
four-stroke engine with typical operation (swallowing) lines is shown in Fig. 2.14 with the engine
speed as parameter, for engines with and without relevant valve overlap.

Basic principles and objectives of supercharging
2.6.2 Interaction of two- and four-stroke engines with
various superchargers
Since now the maps of both chargers and engines have been deﬁned in a compatible way, it becomes
easy to show the interaction of various charger systems with two- and four-stroke engines and then
to evaluate the characteristics of each particular combination.
Four-stroke engine with mechanically powered displacement compressor
AscanbeseeninFig. 2.15,atconstantspeedratiobetweenchargerandengine,pointsofintersection
between charger and engine speed curves result in clearly deﬁned pressure relations. On the one
hand, these increase slightly with increasing engine speed, on the other hand they depend on the
valve timing of the engine (small or large valve overlap with changed scavenging quantity through
the cylinder). Overall, the described combination results in an acceptable boost pressure in the
entire load and speed range of the engine and, with an approximately constant torque curve in the
engine speed range, also satisﬁes the requirements for automotive applications.
In order to cover the total load range of the engine, the boost pressure must be continuously
adjustable between ambient and maximum possible pressure. Regarding the control mechanisms
it should only be mentioned here that the displacement compressor, due to the fact that its char-
acteristic curves are very similar to those of the engine, offers good control conditions, since only
relatively small differential quantities between charger delivery and engine air demand have to be
blown off at partial load or have to be governed. The corresponding control aspects are covered in
depth in Sect. 4.3.
Four-stroke engine with mechanically powered turbo compressor
Here the combined pressure–volume ﬂow map (Fig. 2.16) also provides information about the
engine characteristics that can be expected. At an assumed constant ratio of charger to engine speed,
it can be recognized that only very limited load demands can be met with such a combination of
engine and supercharger.
With increasing engine speed, boost pressure increases parabolically, which is suitable for
applications where the engine is used in combination with an aero or hydro propeller drive (e.g., a
ship or aircraft propeller) or in steady-state operation close to its rated speed.
Applications with engine operation in a wide map range, e.g., automotive applications, are only
reasonable with the use of a variable speed ratio for the charger drive, as it is shown in Fig. 2.17
with a continuously variable ZF-Variomat transmission.

With turbo compressors, control measures may become necessary due to their instable map
area. However, they are in any case necessary to adapt the boost pressure for part-load operation.
They are far more complex than for displacement compressors, since boost pressure changes can
only be achieved via changing the charger speed, e.g., by a change of the charger transmission

types in production today.)
Two-stroke engine with mechanically powered displacement compressor
In the past, the combination of a two-stroke engine with a mechanically powered displacement
compressor (Fig. 2.18) was frequently realized by using the lower side of the piston of large cross-
head engines as a scavenging or supercharge pump. Today, this design is applied only in very rare
cases, since its complexity is signiﬁcantly higher than in the case of other supercharging concepts.
Two-stroke engine with mechanically powered turbo compressor
As Fig. 2.19 shows, the combination of a two-stroke engine with a mechanically driven turbo
compressor meets the requirements of various applications, e.g., either in a propeller drive or
for stationary gen sets. The torque characteristics and the required torque demand from a ship’s
propeller as a ﬂow engine correspond by principle very well. It has to be considered, however,
that any acceleration creates an additional need for torque, which can hardly be covered with the
possible operations curves of this engine-charger combination.
3 Thermodynamics of supercharging
3.1 Calculation of charger and turbine performance
Basic knowledge of thermodynamic processes in combustion engines is assumed for full under-
standing of the following chapter. Only interrelations important for supercharging itself will be
discussed.
In general, a change in state during the (pre)compression of combustion air, i.e., a polytropic
compression, leads to an increase in the temperature of the charge due to
–
the isentropic temperature increase during compression, and
–
the losses associated with the compressor efﬁciency, which ﬁnally will result in a polytropic
change of state for the actual compression process.
For technical compressors, this temperature increase is used to calculate efﬁciency.

(3.3)
and under the simplifying assumption of an ideal gas with constant speciﬁc heat, the following
applies:
ηs-i,C = T2s −T1
T2eff −T1
.
(3.4)
The isentropic speciﬁc compression work can be calculated by applying the fundamental laws of
thermodynamics as

Then, the real compressor power output can be determined as

,
(3.6)
where ηm,C is the mechanical efﬁciency of the compressor (bearing, transmission, sealing).
To describe the pressure ratio p2/p1, i.e., the ratio between start and end pressure of the
compression, the symbol  is frequently used:
 = p2/p1.
(3.7)
24
Thermodynamics of supercharging
3.2 Energy balance of the supercharged engines’ work process
3.2.1 Engine high-pressure process
Now we will examine the actual thermodynamic process, the so-called high-pressure process of
the engine, in which the mechanical cylinder work is generated. The constant-volume cycle serves
as thermodynamically ideal reference cycle. Then heat is supplied instantaneously and completely
at top dead center of the piston movement. This cycle yields the maximum attainable efﬁciency of
a combustion engine at a given compression ratio.
ηthω = 1 −1/εκ−1
(3.8)
or
ηthω = 1 −
p1
p2

.
(3.9)
It can be seen that in this case the thermal cycle efﬁciency depends only on the compression ratio,
and not on the supplied heat quantity and therefore the engine load. For the analysis of the real
engine nowadays so-called thermodynamic cycle simulations are commonly used (see Sect. 3.6).
3.2.2 Gas exchange cycle low-pressure processes
These processes, or cycle parts, describe the charge exchange as well as the exhaust gas energy
utilization for charge precompression and thus the technical processes of related supercharging.
With the principle layout in mind, looking at the pV- and the TS-diagram (Fig.3.1) of a mechanically
supercharged ideal engine, three signiﬁcant facts can be identiﬁed.
As a consequence of the cycle, at the end of the expansion (working) stroke (4) the pressure
in the cylinder of a supercharged four-stroke engine is higher than the ambient pressure p1 (5-6).
However, this higher pressure cannot be transformed into work directly in the cylinder, due to the
fact that the end of expansion is given by its geometric limitation. Therefore, an attempt must be
made to exploit this pressure outside of the work cylinder.
Since the boost pressure is higher than ambient pressure, the gas exchange itself positively
contributes to the engine work.

Without efﬁciency losses, this work would approximately correspond to the compression work
(charge exchange loop 1-5-6-7).
In return, however, the compressor work must be provided by the engine itself. The speciﬁc
compression work which has to be employed is calculated for an isentropic ideal case according
to Eq.(3.5), while – also idealized – the gas exchange work gained, wGEX, is calculated with
Eq.(3.10):
wGEX = (p2 −p1)Vcyl
(3.10)
Accordingly, in the case of mechanical supercharging not the total charger work w will be lost,
but only the difference
ws-i,C −wGEX = w.
(3.11)
This process can be understood as positive work output of the working piston during the intake
stroke, during which the boost pressure p2 (which is higher than the ambient pressure) acts on the
piston. Thus a part of the precompression work can be recovered as crankshaft work, as Fig.3.2
shows schematically.
3.2.3 Utilization of exhaust gas energy
Due to the geometrically given piston movement in a reciprocating piston combustion engine on the
one hand, and on the other due to the thermodynamic cycle of the combustion process, the pressure
at the end of the expansion stroke (5z) is signiﬁcantly higher than the pressure at compression start
of the high-pressure cycle (1z), as was described in Sect.3.2.1 and shown in Fig.3.3.
The energy available in the exhaust gas at the end of expansion in the high-pressure cycle (5z,
5a, 1b) therefore cannot be utilized in the working cylinder of the combustion engine itself but
rather in a suitable downstream process.
Such a downstream process favored today is the recovery of the remaining exhaust gas energy
via a so-called exhaust gas turbine. In it, a ﬂow turbine uses the exhaust gas expansion energy to
power a ﬂow compressor located on the same shaft, which itself precompresses the combustion air
before intake into the work cylinder.
There are several possibilities for the use of the remaining exhaust gas energy. The energy
transport from the cylinder to the turbine is important, i.e., the design of the exhaust manifold.
26
Thermodynamics of supercharging
With a careful layout of the exhaust system, the utilization of the exhaust gas energy can be
maximized.
The corresponding optimization of such systems, i.e., the complex ﬂow conditions around the
exhaust valve, including the area of the exhaust port of a two-stroke engine, demand comprehensive
tests and/or simulations. Only today’s availability of three-dimensional (3-D) mathematical simula-
tion models with sufﬁcient precision makes it possible to study these topics with adequate accuracy
by means of numeric methods.
The aim is the optimum layout of the valve arrangement in combination with an exhaust
manifold designed under gasdynamic aspects, so that maximum pressure recovery can be obtained,
while at the same time the pressure gradient upstream of the turbine is minimized.
The complex issue of exhaust gas energy utilization via exhaust gas turbocharging is a very
central and substantial item in the ﬁeld of supercharging. Therefore, the simulation-related themes
are covered intensively in Sect.3.6, and those of the thermodynamic as well as ﬂow design in
Chap.5.
3.3 Efﬁciency increase by supercharging
3.3.1 Characteristic values for the description of the gas exchange
and engine efﬁciencies
Chain of engine efﬁciencies
In order to clarify those relations, which ultimately will lead to the actual, so-called effective
efﬁciency of a combustion engine, in the following the efﬁciency deﬁnitions of internal combustion
engines are described.
The brake or effective efﬁciency ηeff,
ηeff = Weff/QF,
(3.12)
covers the sum of all losses in an internal combustion engine and can therefore be deﬁned as the
ratio between the brake effective work delivered and the mechanical work equivalent of the added
fuel. In order to be able to evaluate and, if needed, minimize the losses individually, this total
efﬁciency is generally subdivided into the following subefﬁciencies.
The fuel combustion rate ηF
ηF = QF −QF,u
QF
,
(3.13)
is deﬁned as the ratio of burned fuel energy to added fuel energy, QF. It is especially useful for
gasoline engines, which are operated at rich air-to-fuel ratios. The fuel energy not utilized is called
QF,u.
The indicated efﬁciency ηi,
ηi = Wi/QF,
(3.14)
is the ratio between the indicated work (based on the cylinder pressure curve) and the heat equivalent
of the added fuel.
3.3 Efﬁciency increase by supercharging
27
The process efﬁciency ηth,
ηth = Qadd −Qdiss
Qadd
,
(3.15)
reﬂects to what extent the added heat could be converted in a theoretical reference cycle, e.g., in a
constant-volume cycle or a mixed constant-volume–constant-pressure cycle (Seiliger cycle). Here
Qadd describes the added heat and Qdiss the removed heat quantity. Thus, the theoretical efﬁciency
characterizes the maximum of mechanical work which would be extractable from a given heat
quantity, QFηth = Wth.
The cycle efﬁciency factor ηcyc,
ηcyc = Wi/Wth,
(3.16)
contains all internal losses of the high-pressure as well as the low-pressure or gas exchange cycles,
e.g., the inﬂuence of the real instead of the ideal gas characteristics, the residual gas, wall heat, and
work gas losses as well as the gas exchange losses. Due to the latter, it is nowadays mostly further
subdivided into a cycle efﬁciency factor for the high-pressure part of the cycle and one for the gas
exchange cycle, i.e., the low-pressure part, with ηcyc,HP as the term for the high-pressure cycle and
ηcyc,GEX as the term for the gas exchange. As a benchmark for comparison, again the work Wth
attainable in the theoretical comparison cycle is used. The cycle efﬁciency factor describes to what
extent the efﬁciency of the real process approaches the value of the theoretical reference cycle.
The mechanical efﬁciency ηm,
ηm = bmep
imep =
bmep
bmep + fmep,
(3.17)
is deﬁned as the ratio of effective to indicated power or work and thus is also deﬁned as the ratio of
brake to indicated mean effective pressure. Finally, the following chain of efﬁciencies is obtained:
ηeff = ηFηthηcycηm.
(3.18)
Gas exchange characteristics
The charge or gas exchange cycle signiﬁcantly affects the operating behavior of the engine. In
a four-stroke engine, this process primarily takes place during the exhaust and intake strokes, in
a two-stroke engine close to the piston bottom dead center, while the ports are opened. In order
to describe the quality and the characteristics of this process, ratios are deﬁned which enable a
comparison of the gas exchange cycles of various engines. These ratios, which characterize the
volumetric ﬁlling of the cylinder with fresh gas, can be measured only in part directly or indirectly,
often with great difﬁculty, and in part they can be calculated only.
The air delivery ratio λa represents an important factor, since it compares the total effective
volume ﬂow through the engine with the theoretical ﬂow, which is calculated from the displacement
and the number of combustion cycles per unit of time.
λa =

VtotnWC

,
(3.19)
where nWC = n for two-stroke engines and nWC = n/2 for four-stroke engines.
28
Thermodynamics of supercharging
This volume ﬂow ˙V can now be measured directly at the intake into the engine air supply
system,e.g.,withcalibratedgasmeters(normallyincombinationwithlargecompensatingplenums;
see Chap.10). Since the state of gas at this engine intake is practically identical to the ambient
conditions, while on the other hand, especially in supercharged engines, pressures and temperatures
are signiﬁcantly different in the intake plenum, from which the engine aspirates the fresh charge,
we differentiate between an ambient-related and an intake manifold-related air delivery ratio. In the
former case, the volume ﬂow at ambient conditions is measured directly, in the latter case the mean
pressure and temperature in the plenum are used for the calculation of this ratio. The conversion
from the ambient-related to the manifold-related value can be done in the following way:
˙V IP = ˙V amb
ρamb
ρIP
.
(3.20)
It is important to choose the measuring point in the intake manifold or the air plenum (IP) care-
fully so that representative conditions are measured (no local heat increases, no areas with ﬂow
separation, etc.). With the intake manifold-referenced air delivery ratio determined in the described
manner, it is possible to compare measured results from various engines and also to compare
simulated values with test bench data. In regard to their gas cycle quality, it is even possible to
compare supercharged engines – with and without charge air cooling – to naturally aspirating
engines.
It must be considered, however, that the differing temperature level of the fresh gas, both of
engines with and without charge air cooling, may lead to differing heat ﬂows in the intake manifold
and port. Thus, in a highly supercharged engine without charge air cooling, the gas temperature
can be signiﬁcantly higher in some cases than the manifold wall temperature, so that the charge
is cooled down between intake plenum and intake valve, which inﬂuences the volume ﬂow at the
valve signiﬁcantly. In engines with charge air cooling, the fresh gas temperature will possibly be
close to the water temperature and thus the intake port temperature, while in naturally aspirating
engines the charge may be signiﬁcantly heated up in the intake manifold and intake port, especially
at low speeds.
Finally, in gasoline engines, the type of mixture formation – carburator, single- or multipoint
injection, and cylinder direct injection – and the layout of the mixture formation components have
to be considered. Since in the real engine, fresh gas losses may occur during the gas exchange (in
the four-stroke engine and especially in the two-stroke engine, the inlet and outlet control devices
are in part open simultaneously), the air delivery ratio alone cannot adequately describe the quality
of the gas exchange. For that the volumetric efﬁciency λvol can be used, which compares the fresh
gas mass captured in the cylinder – again related to ambient or intake manifold conditions – with
the cylinder displacement,
λvol = mfA/mth.
(3.21)
This value characterizes the remaining fresh gas mass after the gas exchange cycle and thus is,
among other things, a decisive factor for the attainable power. Especially for gasoline engines with
external mixture formation, this value is additionally inﬂuenced by the added fuel vapor or inert gas
(due to exhaust gas recirculated), so that a so-called mixture-related volumetric efﬁciency has to
be distinguished from the air volumetric efﬁciency. The relationship between the two values is
determined by the mass fraction of the fuel and the corresponding density of this medium at intake
manifold conditions. Under the assumption of identical density for combustion gas or vapor and
3.3 Efﬁciency increase by supercharging
29
fresh air, the mixture volumetric efﬁciency can be approximately calculated by modifying the air
delivery ratio according to the fuel mass fraction corresponding with the fuel-to-air ratio:
λvol,mix = mA,cyl + mF,cyl
mth
.
(3.22)
But all these volumetric efﬁciency values can be determined experimentally, directly or indirectly,
only with great difﬁculty (e.g., concentration measurements using tracer gases). On the other hand,
cycle and cfd (computational ﬂuid dynamics) simulations can provide very detailed information
about these values. With such simulations it is also possible to optimize the gas exchange cycle in
regard to those very relevant ﬁgures. Further ratios that are also very relevant for the gas exchange
as well as the operational behavior of the engine, are the following:
scavenging ratio
λS =
mfA
mfA + mRG
,
(3.23)
amount of residual gas
ϕRG =
mRG
mfA + mRG
,
(3.24)
scavenging efﬁciency of the engine
 =
mfA
mfA + mS
.
(3.25)
The scavenging ratio (not to be mixed up with the scavenging air delivery ratio used for the
description of the scavenging cycle of two-stroke engines [126]) speciﬁes the ratio of the fresh gas
mass trapped in the cylinder to the total cylinder charge mass. The amount of residual gas speciﬁes
the ratio of the gas remaining in the cylinder after the gas exchange process to the total cylinder
charge mass. And the scavenging efﬁciency speciﬁes that part of the total aspirated fresh gas mass
which is captured in the cylinder after the gas exchange. Thus, the latter term represents a very
characteristic value for the two-stroke scavenging process. Here, high scavenging efﬁciencies have
to be aimed for to optimally utilize the fresh gas provided by the scavenging pump or blower.
It should be mentioned that the amount of residual gas is decisively dependent on the design and
ﬁring order of the engine. In both a two-stroke and a four-stroke engine, the amount of residual gas is
strongly inﬂuenced by the blow down pressure pulses of the cylinders following in the ﬁring order.
The amount of residual gas can be signiﬁcantly reduced, e.g., by means of an optimized exhaust
manifold layout (connection of cylinders with sufﬁcient angular ﬁring distance, pulse converter,
resonance exhaust manifold). Especially in gasoline engines, in view of knocking stability, the
achievable engine brake mean effective pressure can be increased by such measures. On the other
hand, in modern gasoline and diesel engines, increased amounts of residual gas are desirable in
order to achieve a dethrottling effect at partial load (gasoline engines), as well as to inﬂuence the
combustion temperature and fuel combustion rate with regard to the NOx formation in the engine.
For this as well, the amount of residual gas may be used as a suitable characteristic ﬁgure.
Finally, the relationship between volumetric efﬁciency, air delivery ratio, and scavenging
efﬁciency  is as follows:
 = λvol/λa.
(3.26)

Thermodynamics of supercharging
3.3.2 Inﬂuencing the engine’s total efﬁciency value via supercharging
On the basis of these efﬁciency relationships we can now answer the question why, for a particular
power output, a supercharged engine has a better effective efﬁciency than a naturally aspirated en-
gine. A decisive factor is that for many reasons – e.g., the hydrodynamics of bearing and piston
lubrication – the friction mean effective pressure increases with increasing speed, but only to a
small extent with increasing load. Already on the basis of the equation for the mechanical efﬁciency
(3.17), its dependence on the engine load is very obvious. This will be demonstrated with the
following simple example.
We assume two engines of identical horsepower at a given speed, one of which is a nat-
urally aspirated engine which reaches the required horsepower at a brake mean effective pres-
sure of bmep = 10bar. The other is a correspondingly smaller supercharged engine which
reaches the same horsepower at a brake mean effective pressure of 20bar. For the naturally
aspirated engine, let the friction mean effective pressure be fmep = 2bar. For the supercharged
engine, due to the larger dimensions of its bearings etc. corresponding to the increased cylinder
pressures associated with supercharged operation, let the friction mean effective pressure be
2.2bar.
The result of this is:
–
naturally aspirated engine: ηm = 10/(10 + 2)[bar] = 83%
–
supercharged engine: ηm = 20/(20 + 2.2)[bar] = 90%
As a result of the higher speciﬁc load, the calculated mechanical efﬁciencies show a signiﬁcantly
better value for the supercharged engine, as is also shown in Fig.3.4. Therefore, a very important
relationship can be established between engine load and the effective efﬁciency:
The higher the load – read: the brake mean effective pressure – required for an engine to reach
a given horsepower, the better its effective efﬁciency. Figure3.5 shows this interrelationship for
two medium-speed diesel engines of equal horsepower, with and without supercharging and at two
speeds.

3.4 Inﬂuence of supercharging on exhaust gas emissions
31
In comparison to this, the other efﬁciency factors are barely inﬂuenced by supercharging, since,
due to the change of density of the intake air, the ﬂow and thermodynamic conditions are inﬂuenced
only to a minor extent.
3.4 Inﬂuence of supercharging on exhaust gas emissions
It must be considered that, especially for a diesel engine, the combustion cycle and, thus, the
achievable efﬁciency of the engine are more and more inﬂuenced by the exhaust gas emission
limits regulated by law. It is therefore necessary to brieﬂy discuss the various test procedures
which are used for different vehicle categories in various countries to quantify their pollutant
emission level.
For passenger cars and light-duty trucks (ldv, light-duty vehicle), transient tests with the
complete vehicle, derived from actual driving patterns, are used today, like the so-called ftp

3.4.1 Gasoline engine
For the gasoline engine, the problem of exhaust gas aftertreatment has been solved to a major extend
by the introduction of the λ-controlled three-way catalyst (twc). Further emission reductions,
down to sulev (super ultra low emission vehicle) speciﬁcations, can be achieved mainly by
improving the cold start phase, in which today about 80–85% of the total cycle emissions are
generated, by means of an improved catalyst light-off, and by reduced raw emissions during the
cold start.
In a gas engine, at least for trucks, lean operation can be a fuel-efﬁcient alternative. However,
λ values of at least 1.6–1.8 must be drivable reliably and with low residual methane emissions, i.e.,
with good combustion quality. The gasoline direct-injection engine (gdi), which was introduced
to series production at the end of the nineties, essentially shows the same exhaust gas problem
areas as the direct-injection diesel engine.
3.4.2 Diesel engine
The classic diesel combustion process – like the gdi process just mentioned – always operates with
(sometimes substantial) excess air. This eliminates the possibility of using three-way catalysts as
described above. Critical emissions are particulate matter (PM), NOx as well as CO and HC
emissions.
In heterogeneous combustion, soot must and will always result to some extent as a combustion
end product, so that substantial generation of particulate matter cannot be avoided. The soot emis-
sion, and with it a part of the particulate matter emission, depend on the combustion air ratio. With
a suitable layout of the supercharging system, a supercharged engine can be operated with high
excess air ratios in all load ranges – even at full load – so that the preconditions for low particulate
operation are better with a supercharged engine.
With excess oxygen, the ﬂame temperatures are also always high, inevitably leading to high
nitrogen oxide formation. Since the NOx generation depends to the power of 4 on the tem-
perature prevailing at the point of its formation, primarily local temperature peaks in the combus-
tion chamber must be avoided to prevent NOx emissions. This can best be done by operating
the engine with high excess air ratios or by diluting the charge with inert gas. In the diesel
34
Thermodynamics of supercharging
engine, this can best be realized through the recirculation of cooled, oxygen-depleted exhaust
gas.
Furthermore, since supercharged engines are operated with relatively high compression end
pressures and temperatures, they can be operated with signiﬁcantly later injection start and longer
injection duration than naturally aspirated engines of the same power. This also contributes to the
avoidance of locally high combustion chamber temperatures, without signiﬁcantly increasing fuel
consumption.
In a diesel engine, CO and HC emissions are uncritically low.
The test procedures and emission standards for passenger cars, trucks, and stationary engines
valid in Europe, the United States and Japan are summarized in the appendix – Fig.A.1 and
TablesA.2 to A.5. For additional information, due to the extensive nature of the regulations as well
as test procedures and measurement instructions, it is referred to special literature and Codes of
Regulations.
3.4.3 Methods for exhaust gas aftertreatment
Regarding the methods for exhaust gas aftertreatment as well, we must refer the reader to the broad
spectrum of special literature, unless technical aspects specially related to supercharging demand
otherwise. This is the case when water injection, particulate ﬁlters as well as oxidation or NOx
storage catalysts are applied.
With water injection, not only the temperature of the exhaust gases is lowered due to the
vaporization of the water in the combustion chamber but also the volume ﬂow through the
turbine is increased. This results in a signiﬁcant increase of the enthalpy of the turbine intake
gases, which itself can be used for a further increase in boost pressure or for a turbo-compound
operation.
If particulate ﬁlters are located in the high-pressure exhaust stream, upstream of the turbine,
they represent a considerable heat sink with undesirable consequences for load changes of the
engine. The same is valid for the application of oxidation or NOx storage catalysts if, for whatever
reasons, they are also located upstream of the turbine.
Locating all these aftertreatment systems downstream of the exhaust gas energy recovery
device, like an exhaust gas turbocharger or a compound turbine, at the most slightly increases
the exhaust gas backpressure and thereby reduces the reclaimable exhaust gas expansion pressure
ratio. Other disadvantages, especially during transient operation of such engines, also have to be
taken into account (e.g., extended warm-up periods).
3.5 Thermal and mechanical stress on the supercharged internal
combustion engine
3.5.1 Thermal stress
With increasing fuel quantity, i.e., energy, added to the cylinder, naturally the amount of heat
to be dissipated increases as well. The heat ﬂows through the engine increase correspondingly.
Additionally, as is shown in Fig.3.11, at higher degrees of supercharging and without charge air
cooling, the temperature of the charge air increases signiﬁcantly, which results in further increased
engine thermal loads. Therefore, simultaneous to the strength calculations for new engine layouts
with the ﬁnite-elements (fe) method, numerical cfd simulation tools must be used for the analysis
of the coolant and heat ﬂows.

Only after consideration and analysis of all interactions by means of simulations, an optimum
overall concept can be achieved regarding weight and load capacity combined with sufﬁcient cool-
ing at the smallest coolant circulation quantity possible.
The most important engine parts, besides the complete powertrain structure, are those loaded
with high heat ﬂow density, i.e., the cylinder head, the piston, and the cylinder liner. Figure3.12
shows the maximum operating temperatures of an assembled and force-cooled piston for a medium-
speed diesel engine.
3.5.2 Mechanical stress
With increasing boost pressure, compression end pressure and peak ﬁring pressure are also in-
creased, as shown in Fig.3.13 in a pV and a TS diagram for a naturally aspirated and an exhaust
gas turbocharged engine. The increasing pressures require the strengthening of certain parts or
to approach their limit of strength, e.g., connecting rod, piston, cylinder head and bearings. The
optimization of the entire powertrain of supercharged engines with regard to its strength becomes
more and more important and mandatory as the brake mean effective pressure increases. Today,
new engine designs are no longer feasible without the help of modern numerical simulations.
The strength-related optimization does not mean that supercharged engines have to be signif-
icantly heavier than naturally aspirated engines with comparable displacement.

Very often the design of, e.g., housing wall thicknesses was in the past and still is decided not
by strength, but by casting considerations.
During the layout of the powertrain, especially the dimensions of the bearings, the situation has
to be evaluated in a very differentiated manner depending on the speed and mean effective pressure
values. Inertial forces and gas forces may partially compensate for each other regarding their
effect on bearing loads. Thus, a passenger car gasoline engine designed for high speeds could
occasionally be supercharged without changing the bearing dimensions. In any case, high mean
effective pressure values at low engine speeds are extremely critical for the bearings and therefore
must be investigated in detail.
3.6 Modeling and computer-aided simulation of supercharged engines
3.6.1 Introduction to numeric process simulation
Given the advanced state of research with regard to detailed understanding of the most impor-
tant physical processes in an internal combustion engine, it is possible to describe these rela-
tions by means of mathematical models. In doing so, these models may be based on fundamental
basic equations (e.g., laws of conservation for mass, momentum and energy) as well as on em-
pirical formulations for the description of complex processes (e.g., wall heat losses, heat release
functions).
As a matter of principle, when simulating real processes, all physical relations mentioned above
must be described correctly. Starting from the microscopic processes of thermal ﬂuid dynamics –
which encompasses gas dynamics, chemical reaction kinetics as well as, in the broader sense, the
mechanics and heat conductance of continua, via the mesoscopic processes on the subsystem level,
e.g., the thermodynamics of the entire internal combustion engine – all parts must be considered
in a macroscopic simulation of the total system.
Basically, all complete systems can be reduced to the level of their microscopic subprocesses.
The enormous time and effort necessary for modeling, as well as the extreme requirements re-
garding computing capacity, justify such an approach only in exceptional cases (such as aero-
space), where, e.g., the veriﬁcation of subsystem simulations is not possible by experiments. But
for many technical applications, including the area of engine supercharging, it is desirable to
deﬁne subsystems and to develop and use numeric simulation tools in accordance with the actual
task.
3.6 Modeling and computer-aided simulation of supercharged engines
37
The three simulation levels mentioned above can be classiﬁed here as follows:
1. 3-D ﬂow simulation in the gas conducting components including compressors and turbines
(with consideration of thermal boundary conditions)
2. engine process simulation including the supercharging components
3. simulation of the total system behavior in actual use (e.g., modeling of the complete powertrain
of a vehicle)
In this list, the engine process simulation constitutes the most important tool for layout of the engine
and its supercharging components. For this reason, the corresponding physical and mathematical
relationships will be described in more detail.
Regarding levels1 and 3, only the most important methods will be mentioned and suitable
software packages will be referred to.
3.6.2 Cycle simulation of the supercharged engine
In a thermodynamic cycle simulation, the essential processes of the complete engine system are
described by means of mathematical equations in such a way that the physical states, such as
pressures, temperatures and mass ﬂows, can be calculated in all volumes and at all instants.
Processes on a microscopic scale are described by analogous models and/or measurement data
maps. In this way, on the one hand, highest simulation accuracies (e.g., calculation of engine mass
ﬂows with accuracy within 1–2% of the actual values) and, on the other hand, acceptable computing
times (within minutes) can be achieved.
However, due to the simplifying approach, some subtasks cannot be analyzed with these
methods in sufﬁcient detail, e.g., the ﬂow optimization of the inlet ﬂow to a catalyst located a
short distance downstream of the turbine outlet. For such tasks, the mentioned tools of level1 – in
this case, e.g., the 3-D ﬂow simulation – must be used.
But let us concentrate in this section on the engine process simulation. The individual parts of
the supercharged engine can be categorized into modules. The physical processes in the various
modules are then mapped via mathematical models. With the use of master control programs, the
individual modules can be ﬁnally interconnected. From the previous sections it is obvious that the
following components are especially relevant for supercharged engines:
–
cylinder for the description of the gas exchange and the high-pressure cycle
–
pipe elements
–
plenum elements
–
turbocharger, consisting of ﬂow compressor and turbine
–
displacement compressor
–
charge air cooler
Cylinder
For the mathematical description of the physical processes in the cylinder we can distinguish be-
tween the gas exchange and the high-pressure phase. Only during the gas exchange, mass ﬂows
occur between the cylinder and the connected pipes and manifolds.
Accordingly, for the high-pressure cycle the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for closed systems
can be used assuming a simpliﬁed 1-zone model as follows:

where d(mcyl · u)/dα describes the gradient of the internal energy in the cylinder, (−pcyl · dV/dα)
the piston work, dQF/dα the heat release rate due to the added fuel energy, dQW/dα the wall heat
ﬂow, and hleak · dmleak/dα the enthalpy loss caused by the blowby gas ﬂow (with the fuel energy
QF, wall heat losses QW, and the blowby mass ﬂow dmleak/dα).
It is apparent that the condition in the cylinder – characterized by the internal energy – is changed
by the piston work, the heat energy released during combustion, the wall heat losses and by the
enthalpy drain caused by the blowby mass ﬂow. Equation(3.27) is to be used in general for engines
both with internal and with external mixture formation. However, those terms expressing the change
of gas composition during the high-pressure cycle must be described using the following speciﬁc
characteristics for the differing mixture formation methods.
Internal mixture formation:
–
instantaneous combustion of the added fuel corresponding to the heat release gradient
–
instantaneous complete mixture of the combustion products with the remaining cylinder charge
(1-zone model)
–
continuous reduction of the air/fuel ratio during combustion
External mixture formation:
–
homogeneous fuel–air mixture in the entire cylinder
–
constant air-to-fuel ratio of the unburned charge during combustion
–
same pressure and same temperature for both the burned and the unburned charge fraction
With these assumptions, Eq. (3.27) can be reformulated as follows:

For both equations, the mathematical models for the heat energy released during combustion and
for the wall heat losses still must be deﬁned. As examples out of a multitude of models, here the

tion).
The modiﬁed Woschni wall heat loss model [151] for the high-pressure phase reads as

In these equations, QWi describes the wall heat ﬂows (cylinder, piston, liner), Ai the correspond-

Combined with the gas equation

where Ro is the gas constant, the complete system of equations can be solved for any crank angle
iteration by methods such as the Runge–Kutta method; this way, the conditions in the cylinder

For the determination of the mass ﬂows through the intake and exhaust ports, a model with an
equivalent throttle concentrated in the valve gap is used. Thus, all ﬂow losses occurring in the port
and valve gap are represented by this equivalent throttle, which, depending on the valve position,
opens varying effective ﬂow areas and therefore mass ﬂows at given pressure gradients between
cylinder and the connected port.

The effective ﬂow area mentioned above is the result of complex three-dimensional ﬂow processes
especially in the valve area. Thus, it must either be calculated using 3-D ﬂow simulations or it has

to be determined from ﬂow bench tests. Moreover, it can be related to a speciﬁc reference area –
usually the inner valve seat area (Fig.3.14) – so that the efﬁciency of a port can be described by a
ﬂow coefﬁcient.

(3.44)
where µσ is the dimensionless port ﬂow coefﬁcient and dVi the inner valve seat diameter (reference
diameter). This approach moreover allows a comparison of the port efﬁciencies of different
engines.
Besides their quantity, the gas composition of the exhausting mass ﬂows is also a relevant
parameter for the gas exchange. In both four-stroke engines and, especially, in two-stroke engines,
phases occur during the gas exchange, during which both the inlet and exhaust ports or valves are
open. The scavenging process occurring during that period can be characterized using one of the
following models (Fig.3.15).
–
Perfect displacement scavenging: The entering fresh gas displaces the exhaust gas present in
the cylinder without mixing and without scavenging losses of fresh gas through the exhaust
ports.
–
Perfect mixing scavenging: The entering fresh gas mixes immediately and completely with
the gas present in the cylinder, so that the leaving gas mixture contains both fresh gas
and exhaust gas. This scavenging model is preferentially used for the relatively short
overlap period in four-stroke engines; for two-stroke engines with relatively low scaveng-
ing quality it can also be used with success if more precise scavenging models are not
available.
–
Shortcut scavenging: The entering fresh gas immediately leaves the cylinder via the exhaust
ports, without inﬂuencing the composition of the cylinder mass.
–
Real engine scavenging: Especially for two-stroke engines, it is desirable to chose and
develop engine layout and port shapes whose scavenging behavior approaches the perfect

scavenging process as much as possible. Uniﬂow or longitudinal scavenging, in which the
inlet and exhaust ports are located at the bottom and top of the cylinder, fulﬁlls these
requirements best; another layout often used is loop scavenging, where a kind of loop ﬂow
pattern is generated to scavenge the entire cylinder volume without shortcut ﬂows to the exhaust
ports.

as well as the gas Eq. (3.36), again a system of equations is available which can be solved numeri-
cally for each crank angle iteration and which allows the calculation of the values of all gas exchange
parameters.
Pipe elements
The exact simulation of the engine’s cycle also necessitates the gas-dynamically correct sim-
ulation of the ﬂow in the pipes. Under consideration of the laws of conservation for mass,
momentum and energy, the following set of equations can be compiled to describe the ﬂow in a

and ﬁnite-volume methods. The principles behind both methods will now be brieﬂy discussed. For
detailed studies it is referred to the literature [127, 128].
With the characteristics method, the solutions to this system of equations are calculated se-
quentially following the progression of the characteristics, which are the two Mach curves
v ± a. In the av ﬁnite-state diagram, the spacial and temporal changes in the pipe state can be
determined, under consideration of the dependencies on sonic and ﬂow speeds, iteratively at
all grid points; the particle traces dx/dt = v can be determined in the state diagram (Fig.3.16).
The basic difference between this solution algorithm and differences methods is the fact that
with this method the grid points are not ﬁxed from the outset for predetermined time and cell
increments.
An especially advantageous solution algorithm based on the ﬁnite-volume method is the eno
scheme 1 [58, 131, 52]. It achieves at least the same accuracy as ﬁnite-differences methods of
second order and at the same time has the same stability as methods of ﬁrst order. It divides the
manifold elements into one-dimensional ﬁnite-volume elements which exchange mass, enthalpy,
and momentum ﬂows over the element boundaries. In order to correctly determine the gas dy-
namic processes, however, the angle or time iterations t have to be adapted to the chosen cell
sizes x, according to the cfl criterion (stability criterion according to Courant, Friedrichs,
and Lewy):
t ≤
x
v + a.
(3.51)
Starting with the status at the begin of each time iteration, and with the above mentioned ﬂows over
the cell boundaries in the temporal center of the time iteration, the result and thus the cell status at
the end of the time iteration is calculated.

Thermodynamics of supercharging
Plenum elements
For the modeling of a plenum element, basically the same equations can be used which describe the
processes in a cylinder (Eq.(3.37)). Moreover, if the cylinder has a constant volume, the equation
simpliﬁes as follows:

dα

 dQW
dα

 dmin
dα hin −

(3.52)
In special geometric designs of a plenum, momentum passages can occur in which the kinetic
energy of an incoming mass ﬂow only partially mixes inside the plenum. In such special cases,
additional assumptions regarding the fraction of the passing kinetic energy must be made and the
corresponding energy ratios in the above equation must be amended. However, for typical plenum
layouts with several connections, the assumption of a complete mixing of the kinetic energy of the
incoming ﬂows is justiﬁed, so that for the overwhelming majority of plenums the thermodynamic
behavior can adequately be described by Eq.(3.52). The wall heat losses QW have to allow for the
conditions given by the plenum shape, surface geometry, and the ﬂow pattern. After an estimate
of the surface actively participating in the heat transfer, the corresponding wall heat transfer
coefﬁcients must be veriﬁed via measured data (comparison between measured and calculated
temperatures).
Turbocharger
Theturbocharger,asthecentralelementofasuperchargedengine,constitutesanextremelycomplex
ﬂow machine, both for the compressor and the turbine, as we have seen in previous sections.
By means of mathematical models, which consider the losses in the compressor and turbine
via isentropic efﬁciencies, it is relatively easy to describe the thermodynamics of a turbocharger
operating at steady state.
PC = PT,
(3.53)
PC = ˙mC(h2 −h1),
(3.54)
PT = ˙mTηm,TC(h3 −h4),
(3.55)
where PC is the compressor power, PT the turbine power, ˙mC and ˙mT the compressor or the turbine
mass ﬂow.
The enthalpy differences h2 −h1 and h3 −h4 can be calculated under consideration of
the internal isentropic efﬁciencies of the compressor and the turbine (Eq.(3.3)). Together
with the mechanical efﬁciency mentioned above, turbocharger total efﬁciency ηTC can be
determined:
ηTC = ηm,TCηs-i,Tηs-i,C.
(3.56)
The pressure upstream of the turbine is thermodynamically analogous to the resistance of a throttle.
The temperature downstream of the throttle (turbine), however, has to be calculated based on
Eq.(3.3), which in this case describes an expansion.
Furthermore, with changes of the charger speed, which is proportional to the angular velocity

ωTC, considerations must be made for rotor inertia ITC, so that the following equation can be
deﬁned:

.
(3.57)
The efﬁciencies appearing in these equations, as well as the effective equivalent ﬂow area for
the turbine, can be derived from measured compressor and turbine maps. If such measurement
data are not available, these data can be obtained either by scaling of similar maps or by
empirical approximation methods which are based on the main geometric dimensions of turbo
machines. Such numerical models were developed by various researchers, e.g., by Malobabic
[93] for both compressors and turbines, as well as by Swain [136, 139] and Baines [13]. As
can be seen in Fig.3.17, these methods emanate from certain geometric boundary conditions.
As a result, and considering empirical estimates for the losses, the maps can be drawn in good
approximation (Figs.3.18 and 3.19). If only incomplete measurement data exist, which often is the
case especially with turbines (since the operational possibilities on a turbocharger test bench are

Displacement compressor
Basically, the modeling of a mechanically driven charger corresponds to a partial task of
turbocharger simulation, i.e., only the compressor has to be modeled. Thus, e.g., the operating
point of the charger can be freely chosen in order to deﬁne the design point of the compressor. In
the rest of the map and engine operation, the charger operating points result from the either ﬁxed
or variable gear ratio between charger and internal combustion engine and the engine’s swallowing
capability. In the most extreme case, a complete uncoupling of engine and charger speed via an
electric or hydraulic link could also be imagined. However, the losses associated with such energy
conversions mostly limit their application possibilities in practice.
Thus the change of state as well, i.e., the temperature increase, in a mechanic charger can be
described with the isentropic equation, as long as the pressure ratio and the corresponding isentropic
efﬁciency are known (Eq.(2.14)).
The pressures mentioned, p1 and p2, establish themselves according to the ﬂow restrictions
in the intake system up- and downstream of the compressor and the engine, where the delivery
characteristic of the compressor must be described on the basis of measured maps (Fig.3.21).
Lastly, the required power can be calculated by the following equation (also see Eq.(3.6)):

of the entire supercharging system, provided that maximum power density and lowest brake speciﬁc

Normally, charge air coolers are designed as conventional air-to-air heat exchangers, or in spe-
cial cases as air-to-water heat exchangers.
To record the gasdynamic processes in a charge air cooler, i.e., the ﬂow distribution into the in-
dividual sections of the matrix as well as the pulsations excited by the engine, all 3-D geometry
parameters must be considered. For such a detailed analysis, it is advisable to simulate the charge
air cooler by 3-D cfd methods embedded into a 1-D mathematical model (see Sect.3.6.3).
For engine layouts as well as design of charge air coolers it has proven to be advantageous to
describe the radiator by a model as sketched in Fig.3.22.
In doing so it is decisive to correctly cover the pressure loss and the cooling effect of the radiator
matrix; this can be achieved by means of tuning the heat transfer coefﬁcient and the wall friction
coefﬁcient of the pipe element between the two plenums. It is also important to model the plenums
as well as the gasdynamically active length between inlet and outlet in such a manner that the
damping and the run time effects correspond to the actual circumstances. This can especially be
of decisive importance if the gas in the intake system, and thus the charge air cooler, is excited to
oscillation by the gas exchange process of the engine. Further modeling approaches, some simpler
and others more in-depth, are described in the relevant literature, e.g., reference 24.
For the numeric simulation of transient engine operation, the inertia of the rotating mass of the
engine has to be related to the actual load and engine torque or the corresponding power:

Thetransientengineprocessescannowalsobedescribedwiththeequationsgivenabove,where,
however, the load dependency of many parameters, such as combustion data, fuel quantities, wall
temperatures in the engine and especially in the exhaust system, must be considered. For this,
the time-correct input of the heat capacities is also necessary in order to correctly simulate the
lagged response of the turbine after a sudden load variation. The modeling of the manifolds has
to consider the material properties and layout (cast iron, plastic, steel manifold, insulation, double
wall manifolds, etc.).
Further subsystem elements often used in supercharged engines, such as air ﬁlter, intake
noise mufﬂer, egr (exhaust gas recirculation) radiator, exhaust gas catalyst, and mufﬂer
may be individually conﬁgured from the components discussed above, i.e., pipe and plenum.
Many commercially available software packages for thermodynamic cycle simulations also offer
predeﬁned modules for these elements.
3.6.3 Numeric 3-D simulation of ﬂow processes
Parallel to the layout and optimization of the thermodynamic process of supercharged internal
combustion engines using the 1-D simulation methods discussed in the last section, for best geo-
metric design further detail optimizations of the gas-containing parts must be performed. This
is possible by numeric 3-D cfd simulations. With them, objective analyses and assessments of
designs and variants can be done.
For such an analysis, advanced engineering cad drawings are necessary, on the basis of which
the geometric boundary conditions can be exactly described.
Those 3-D design methods are especially advantageous which are based on so-called solids,
i.e., bodily imaginary elements. On the basis of these elements, totally closed surface models can
be derived. The calculation grids must now be ﬁt into these surfaces. In the case of good surface
quality, it is advantageous to use automated grid generators. For the latter tasks, a number of
3.6 Modeling and computer-aided simulation of supercharged engines
49
commercially available program packages exist (avl-fame, pro-star).
Besides gas ﬂows, ﬂuid ﬂows are also simulated by cfd methods, e.g., the coolant ﬂow in the
engine crankcase and the cylinder head. In general, the most important tasks of cfd simulation
within the framework of the development of supercharged engines can be summarized (without
tasks regarding application and production engineering such as engine compartment ﬂow patterns
or simulation of casting related processes) as follows:
–
gas ﬂows in the engine-related air conducting manifolds (both upstream and downstream of
the compressor): minimization of pressure losses, acoustic phenomena, compressor oncoming
ﬂow, quality of the intake manifold ﬂow, egr feed to the intake manifold, egr distribution in
the intake plenum, mixture formation and wall agglomeration in the intake manifold
–
gasﬂowsintheengine-relatedexhaustmanifolds:minimizationofpressurelossesintheexhaust
manifold, turbine and waste-gate ﬂow admission, catalyst ﬂow admission, resonance mufﬂers
for two-stroke engines
–
internal engine processes: ﬂow patterns during the compression and combustion processes,
internal mixture formation in direct-injection diesel and direct-injection gasoline engines,
propagation of the combustion zone and pollutant formation, pre- and swirl-chamber design
for combustion processes with divided combustion chamber, two-stroke scavenging ﬂow, ﬂows
in the fuel system
–
coolant ﬂows in ﬂuid-cooled and air-cooled engines: optimization of ﬂow ducts regarding
heat transfer, minimization of pressure losses, elimination of dead water zones, elimination of
cavitation
Several examples of such cfd analyses – especially for elements of supercharged engines – will
be discussed in Sect.5.5.
3.6.4 Numeric simulation of the supercharged engine in connection
with the user system
The objective of any engine layout is the best fulﬁllment of as many requirements of the user system
as possible. In the case of a passenger car, this would include, e.g., the acceleration capability,
elasticity, maximum vehicle speed, gradeability, pollutant emissions, as well as smoothness and
noise radiation.
With the methods shown in Sects.3.6.2 and 3.6.3, an exact simulation of the engine-related
processes is possible. However, reactions caused by the load (e.g., drivetrain as well as vehicle)
on the internal combustion engine and the total environment (e.g., thermal system) cannot be
comprehensively incorporated.
Such problems related to the total process thus have to be described by methods which reﬂect all
relevant physical subprocesses (engine, supercharging system, drivetrain, engine control, thermal
and electrical system, air conditioning of the passenger compartment, vehicle dynamics) with
sufﬁcient accuracy, without resulting in processing times for modeling, simulation, and evaluation
which are not practically feasible.
Tools suited for this task are commercially available program packages (avl-cruise,
advisor, gt-drive, etc.) or the program system gpa (total process analysis) of the German
Forschungsvereinigung Verbrennungskraftmaschinen (fvv; Research Consortium for Internal
Combustion Engines, Frankfurt am Main). With these, the operational behavior of the complete
system can be simulated and optimized. The possible applications extend from cold start analysis,

optimization of the transient operation (acceleration capability) to error simulations, with which
the impacts of, e.g., incorrect sensor readings on engine control can be analyzed.
The program systems mentioned use various techniques to reduce the simulation times. As
an example, gpa simulates and ﬁles an expanded engine map before the actual simulation of the
complete system, which also covers all occurring transient operation situations. The time needed
for the description of the engine behavior simultaneous to the cycle simulation is thereby greatly
reduced. However, the acceleration of the computing time principally is linked to a certain reduction
in accuracy.
It is therefore always necessary to identify the objectives of an analysis in order to choose, in
each case, the tool with the proper accuracy and signiﬁcance.
Figure3.23 shows a comparison of the measured and the simulated fuel mass ﬂows in the
standardized nedc. On the basis of such veriﬁed models, preoptimizations can be performed
before development on a test bench or in a vehicle, and, e.g., the number of control strategies to
be experimentally analyzed can be reduced.
4 Mechanical supercharging
4.1 Application areas for mechanical supercharging
If the precompressor (displacement or turbo compressor) is directly powered by the engine, it
is classiﬁed as mechanical supercharging. As a general rule, a ﬁxed gear ratio is sufﬁcient for
displacement compressors, while a variable gear ratio is necessary for most applications of turbo
compressors.
Under the simplifying assumption of ﬁxed gear ratios for both supercharging methods, slightly
increasing pressure ratios will be obtained with increasing speed with the displacement compressor,
while the pressure ratio curves show a parabolic gradient for a turbo compressor linked to the
engine via transmission with ﬁxed gear ratio, similar to a throttle curve. Depending on the speciﬁc
application, the gear ratio must be chosen in such a way that either the desired power or the desired
torque level at low speed is obtained. The following relationships can be established between engine
torque T and engine speed nE:
–
Constant speed operation
nE = constant
T = variable (e.g., generator operation)
Displacement compressor and turbo compressor with ﬁxed speed ratio are suited; the turbo
compressor can be adapted very well.
–
Propeller operation
nE = variable
T increases parabolically (e.g., ship operation)
If acceleration phases are not taken into account, the turbo compressor with ﬁxed ratio is well
suited for this application, due to the fact that its pressure characteristic is identical to the load
curve.
–
Automotive operation
nE = variable
T = variable
Torque backup at lower speed is desired. In such an application only the displacement
compressor with ﬁxed ratio provides acceptable torque curves. However, a variable gear ratio
would here, too, enable a better match of the torque curve to the traction force hyperbola. In
any case, engines with ﬂow chargers can provide the desired torque curve only with variable
charger gear ratio (e.g., cvt).
Since the volume of a mechanical charger increases about linearly with the ﬂow rate, their
application today is mostly limited to smaller automotive engines up to 3–4 liter displacement.
The preferred application area is gasoline engines, where exhaust gas turbocharging is not yet in
series production on a major scale, especially due to the high thermal load of the charger.
52
Mechanical supercharging
4.2 Energy balance for mechanical supercharging
To examine the energy balance of displacement compressors in collaboration with a reciprocating
piston combustion engine, pV and TS diagrams are especially suited. Figure 4.1 shows the principle
layout and Fig. 4.2 the pV and TS diagrams.
From the pV diagram, it can be well recognized that the compression work performed by the
charger theoretically could be reclaimed to a considerable extent as positive gas exchange work. In
practice, the efﬁciencies involved, during compression (ηges,C of about 60%) as well as during the
gas exchange itself, prevent that. Only a recovery in the order of about 20–30% of the compressor
driving power is attainable. Therefore, the disengagement of mechanically driven chargers in those
load ranges where no boost pressure is needed is desirable or even necessary for efﬁciency reasons.
Further, in supercharged gasoline engines a deterioration of the high-pressure efﬁciency ηHP
occurs, which is shown in Fig. 4.3 depending on charge air cooling, intake temperature, and the
air-to-fuel ratio λ. Problems arise in that load area which needs only a partial boost pressure, as in
the case of the quantity load control of a gasoline engine.

Figure 4.4 shows a comparison of the part-load fuel consumption values of diesel engines
of equal power, on the one hand, mechanically supercharged (but with and without charger
disengagement), on the other, exhaust gas turbocharged. It is obvious that the control of the boost
pressure of mechanically driven chargers, discussed in the next section, is of special importance.
4.3 Control possibilities for the delivery ﬂow of mechanical superchargers
To estimate and evaluate the options for charge pressure control, necessary in most cases, the
pressure–volume (mass) ﬂow diagram of charger and engine already described in depth is useful.
It is very reasonable to examine the control possibilities for four-stroke and two-stroke engines
separately due to their highly different engine operating characteristics.
4.3.1 Four-stroke engines
Displacement compressors
If the delivery curves of the charger and the swallowing capacity of the engine are plotted together
(Fig. 2.15), it can be seen that for displacement compressors, with the steep characteristic curves
typical for both charger and engine, the difference in delivery mass between charger and engine
increases only slightly with decreasing charge pressure. This means for the control system that only
small amounts of the entire charge ﬂows – as a function of load or speed – have to be manipulated,
i.e., have to be either blown off or rerouted upstream of the charger via a bypass valve.
Bypass control is meaningful in the load area where a partial boost pressure is necessary,
thus in the map area between max and  = 1. This boost pressure bypass control is necessary
for gasoline engines with quantity control, since the mixture quantity aspirated by the engine is
determined by the pressure upstream of the intake valve.
Also for the diesel engine a lowered part-load boost pressure is desirable, since the correspond-
ing reduction of required charger driving power leads to a lower part-load fuel consumption.
Additionally, with this system layout (Fig. 4.5), air mass ﬂow measurement is possible despite
charger bypass, which is necessary in a gasoline engine with stoichiometric λ control and in a
diesel engine with a controlled exhaust gas recirculation system.

Fig. 4.5. Charger pressure control via compressor bypass layout for a permanently engaged charger [132]
Fig. 4.6. Charger pressure control via compressor bypass and charger disengagement [132]
The disengagement of mechanically powered chargers, whether equipped with a bypass setup
or not, saves energy in the load range in which the engine can be operated as a naturally aspirated
engine. Independent of the load control method of the engine, disengagement always makes sense
since it avoids the charger’s inner losses, reduces the operation time of the charger, and increases
its durability. Figure 4.6 shows the basic principle layout. Charger disengagement is imperative
when using chargers with internal compression, since otherwise unnecessary compression work
will be expended. In this case, the nonreturn valve has to be opened by a controlled servo device
or by the pumping work of the engine.
In a gasoline engine additionally the throttle plate, present in any event, can be used for load
control in the complete load range.
Blowoff control, the most simple way to adapt the air quantity to the engine air require-
ment, should only be chosen in special cases, e.g., for emergency shutoff, since it is very
inefﬁcient.
Charger speed control is also only used in special cases, when the boost pressure of a displace-
ment compressor has to be increased in the lower engine speed range. In this case, it is advantageous
if the necessary gear ratio changes for the charger drive are moderate and, if necessary, may only
be shifted stepwise.
Turbo compressors
Charger control for mechanically powered turbo compressors turns out to be totally different.
For a deﬁned part-load boost pressure, arbitrarily chosen in the charger map, a variable charger
speed control system has to be considered in any case. Otherwise, signiﬁcant air quantities are
to be blown by or blown off via a bypass layout. Controlled part-load boost pressure values can
be obtained without waste of energy only with variable charger speed. Technical solutions for
such a system are continuously variable belt or chain transmissions, as well as hydrodynamic
transmissions (Foettinger) and hydrostatic drives. All these solutions can be controlled easily and
are reliable. However, they suffer under the required very broad speed range and very high engine

speed gradients. In addition, all above mentioned technical solutions lead to signiﬁcant system cost
(Fig. 4.7).
Measures which inﬂuence the map width or the possible pressure ratio changes of turbo
compressors will be discussed in detail in Chap. 5.
4.3.2 Two-stroke engines
The pressure–volume ﬂow map of two-stroke engines with an approximately symmetric timing
diagram corresponds to a delivery rate curve with starting point at zero delivery and dependence
on the prevailing exhaust backpressure (Fig. 2.13). Signiﬁcantly different swallowing capacity
functions, closer to the four-stroke engine, occur in longitudinally scavenged two-stroke slow-
speed diesel engines with asymmetric scavenge port timing (including variable exhaust closing).
From this behavior it follows that for such an application a mechanically driven turbo
compressor with ﬁxed speed ratio yields very good results, unless special operating conditions,
such as fast load changes, accelerations, or speed changes of the engine play a major role.
In contrast, displacement compressors with ﬁxed gear ratio are not suitable. Adaptations for
special conditions, e.g., high air-to-fuel ratio at idle speed, may necessitate a variable speed
control of the charger for two-stroke engines as well. Mechanically driven chargers nowadays
are of some importance for small high-speed engines, although such engines are barely in series
production.

today is limited to applications like scavenging pump for two-stroke engines, either by using
the bottom side of the engine’s piston (in small, inexpensive two-stroke engines as a crankcase
scavenging pump) or in slow-speed cross-head engines as end compression stage and scavenging
pump in combination with exhaust gas turbocharging.
For reasons of their installed size and weight, the so-called rotational piston chargers have
gained more importance, since they can be operated at signiﬁcantly higher speeds than the engine

itself. Rotational piston chargers exist in very different designs. Systematic compilations of these
were done by Felix Wankel, recently by G. Haider [56], and by other authors.
Within the framework of this book we will only take a closer look at those few types of chargers
which are either in series production or feature special advantages for future applications.
Roots blower
Today, the Roots blower is the displacement compressor produced in largest quantities. Major
manufacturers are Eaton and Ogura (Figs. 4.8 and 4.9). This design consists of a pair of double-
or triple-lobed rotational pistons arranged on two separate shafts. Only an insigniﬁcant internal
compression takes place. The dead space of the charger is large. Advantages are the, for a
displacement compressor, simple design associated with comparably low manufacturing cost,
sufﬁcient durability with efﬁciencies staying constant due to contactless sealing of the working
plenums, and the relatively small installed size due to high possible charger speeds.
Since the Roots blower has practically no internal compression, and in addition the air delivery
occurs with large ﬂuctuations due to design limitations, the control of boost pressure pulsations and
the charger’s noise emissions are its main problem areas. They can only be satisfactorily solved by
special geometric design of the inlet and outlet ports as well as appropriate twisting of the rotational
pistons.
Another problem is the low achievable boost pressure at low engine speeds, due to the gap
losses between rotational piston and housing, which can only be sealed contactless. A variable
charger drive gear ratio, as minimum changeable stepwise, is therefore under closer consideration
by some designers.
In the future, the major applications will likely be in passenger car gasoline engines, with
advantages such as an arrangement of the charger on the “cold” intake side of the engine (no
additional measures on the “hot” exhaust manifold side are necessary), an instantaneous boost
pressure buildup, the wide usable map, and only minor requirements regarding the realizable
pressure ratio providing a good basis for series application.
It is used in increasing quantities, e.g., by Mercedes Benz in their 1.8 and 2.0 liter compressor
engines for the C and E class and some slk models.

Spiral charger
For several years, the spiral charger was in series production by Volkswagen (vw), under the name
of G-Charger, to provide high-end power variants for some models. Manufacturing problems such
as cost and performance uniformity led to its demise.
Spiral chargers are working according to the principle of interleaved scrolling spirals. They are
eccentrically arranged in such a way that two spiral segments pump from outside inlets into two
inner outlets (Fig. 4.10). During this process, the internal volume is reduced, which results in an
internal compression. The advantages of this design are its small moment of inertia (about one-tenth
to one-twentieth of that of rotational piston chargers), low noise emission level, and low weight.
Disadvantages are its complicated production and sealing problems both between the very long
spiral delivery elements and the housing and in the outlet area. abb Turbo Systems was attempting
to reintroduce this charger type into the market under the name Ecodyno. The main application
shouldagainbethesmallhigh-powergasolineengine,duetotheadvantagesmentionedabove[132].
Wankel-2/3 (Ro) and -3/4 (Pierburg) charger
The companies kkk (today 3K Warner) and Pierburg have developed 2- and 3-lobed rotational
piston chargers following patents by Felix Wankel (Figs. 4.11 and 4.12) and offered them as
prototypes. These are both two-concentric-shaft rotational piston chargers with three or four work

plenums. In kkk’s Ro charger, the two-lobed inner rotor dips into three corresponding recesses
in the outer rotor. The speed of the inner rotor therefore is 1.5-fold of that of the outer rotor. The
inner rotor is powered, and it drives the outer rotor via a pinion and an internally geared wheel.
In Pierburg’s DK compressor, a three-lobed inner rotor dips into four recesses in the outer rotor.
The inner rotor’s speed is therefore 1/3 higher than that of the outer rotor.
Application areas would also be small supercharged gasoline engines. However, up to now
these charger types have not been used in series production.
Lysholm screw-type compressor
Advantages of the screw-type compressor ﬁrst introduced by Lysholm in the 1930s are especially
the high internal compression as well as the high pressure ratios and efﬁciencies attainable. It is a
two-separate-shaft rotational piston charger with main and secondary rotors (Fig. 4.13). Here, the
main rotor has four, the secondary rotor six cogs. The main rotor runs at 1.5 times the speed of the
secondary rotor. Especially the gap losses are critical, due to the high pressure ratios attainable.
Production of the highly twisted cog proﬁles is very complex. The moment of inertia of the rotor is
higher than that of a Roots blower. On the other hand, it enables an especially even delivery curve,
and high charger speeds can be obtained, resulting in small charger dimensions.
Lysholm compressors are produced by Svenska Rotor Maskiner in Sweden and by ihi in Japan.
They were brieﬂy used for series application at Mazda and have been used by DaimlerChrysler in
their amg C32 model (Fig. 4.14).
Due to the high efﬁciencies and pressure ratios, the main application areas in the future for
screw-type compressors will mostly be modern high-performance engines for vehicles or boats.

4.4.2 Turbo compressors
The design of a turbo compressor does not have to be discussed in detail at this point since it
does not differ from the turbocharger compressor. Instead of the turbine, only a corresponding
drive, e.g., a mechanical connection to the crankshaft via cvt transmission (see Fig. 4.7) or an
electric motor in a mechanically powered turbo compressor has to be incorporated. The system
shown in Fig. 13.7 is used in the United States under the tradename Turbopac in small quantities
for retroﬁtting commercial vehicle diesel engines.
5 Exhaust gas turbocharging
5.1 Objectives and applications for exhaust gas turbocharging
The clear objective of exhaust gas turbocharging is the increase in power density of reciprocating
piston internal combustion engines by means of precompressing the work medium, i.e., air. It uti-
lizes the exhaust gas energy which otherwise – due to the geometrically given expansion ratio of the
crank mechanism – would be lost at the end of the high-pressure cycle. Simultaneously, the
boundary conditions for combustion and the high-pressure cycle can be improved so that their
control and emission level can be optimized.
Therefore, the main application areas for exhaust gas turbocharging are those in which high
engine power density has to be obtained in combination with minimized emission and fuel con-
sumption values. Thus, exhaust gas turbocharging will always be preferred, if it can be realized
technically and at an acceptable cost.
5.2 Basic ﬂuid mechanics of turbocharger components
This section will primarily discuss the basic ﬂuid mechanics necessary for understanding super-
charging equipment with ﬂow compressors and turbines. It will not discuss the problems and meth-
ods associated with their layout and optimization. For that, we refer to the relevant literature [42,
43, 81, 90].
5.2.1 Energy transfer in turbo machines
Compression
In ﬂow compressors, the pressure increase of the work medium occurs in several phases proceeding
nearly simultaneously.
On the one hand, by adding external mechanical energy, the medium is forced into a vectored
speed, i.e., kinetic energy (change of state from 1 to 2) in the compressor impeller.
This is then changed into pressure energy (change of state from 2 to 3), partially by deceleration
of the medium in the divergent blade channels of the compressor impeller itself, and partially in a
downstream static diffuser.
The addition of energy and the pressure increase (in the decelerated ﬂow) can be described
using the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for open systems (also see Eq.(2.15), without consideration
of the inﬂuence of geodetic altitude):
h1 + c2
1/2 = h2 + c2
2/2 + wt + qadd,
(5.1)
where h describes the enthalpy, wt the technical work added (or subtracted) from outside, and qadd
the heat added (or subtracted) from outside.
5.2 Basic ﬂuid mechanics of turbocharger components
61
Under the assumption of an adiabatic system (1–2), the following applies for the addition of
kinetic energy wt:

(5.5)
Expansion
The desired gain in technical work is also obtained in processes occurring nearly simultaneously.
On the one hand, the pressure energy of the medium is partially changed into kinetic energy
(change of state from 1 to 2) in the converging blade channels or volute.
This, as well as the remaining pressure energy, is now converted in the rotor into mechanical
work(changeofstatefrom2to3)viaﬂowdeﬂectionandfurtherpressurereduction(actioetreactio).
These changes of state can again be described using the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for open
systems (Eq.(5.1)).

(5.7)
Generally, the reverse process – accelerated ﬂow – is easier to comprehend. Here, in accordance
with the law of energy conservation, pressure is converted into velocity (conversion of potential
pressure energy into dynamic ﬂow energy).
The discussion of the turbine and its special properties will be continued in depth in Sect.5.4.2.
5.2.2 Compressors
Axial compressor
Since the pressure increase via deceleration (Bernoulli) can best be illustrated using an axial
compressor stage as example, we will use this layout of a ﬂow engine to describe the relevant
processes leading to a pressure gain using energy input (Fig.5.1).
62
Exhaust gas turbocharging
Fig. 5.1. Flow process with relevant velocity triangles for an axial compressor
stage [120]
As can be seen, the blade pitch for both rotor and diffuser is such that the inlet angles are
smaller in comparison with the corresponding outlet angles. Therefore, the areas measured vertical
to the blade proﬁles must increase (compressor!) and the relative ﬂow velocity w must decrease in
the channels formed by the blades, i.e., w1 > w2.
Since the compressor rotor is powered, and thus energy is added, the absolute velocity c of the
medium to be compressed nevertheless increases: c2 > c1. This energy is utilized in the diffuser
for an additional pressure increase, by deceleration of the medium. The ratio between the pressure
increase in the rotor and the total pressure gain in the stage is called reaction rate r. It is exactly
deﬁned as the ratio between the enthalpy conversion in the rotor and the total enthalpy conversion
of the compressor:
r = hs,C-Rot
hs,C
.
(5.8)
Characteristic for an axial compressor is that its diameter is nearly constant. Thus, in the optimum
layout, several compressor stages are compiled into a multistage medium-pressure or high-pressure
compressor (e.g., for gas turbines).
In an axial compressor, for pressure generation no change in the rotor diameter, i.e., no
increased outlet diameter, is needed. Therefore, its inlet diameter is the largest diameter of the
entire compressor. They are therefore predestined for large air quantities at a given outer diameter
(jet aircraft). However, to generate higher pressures, they mostly need several stages since the
pressure levels obtainable per stage are far lower than those of a radial compressor.
Radial compressor
The pressure increase, per stage, in a radial compressor strongly depends on the blade shape
(Fig.5.2; left, rearward bent; right, straight blades), and additionally on the ratio between the inlet
and the outlet diameter of the compressor impeller. Its total pressure generation occurs in three
steps.

Here, in a blade or disc diffuser, downstream of the impeller, the medium is decelerated from
the absolute outlet velocity at the radial impeller c2 to the outlet velocity of the compressor c3.
Therefore, the total pressure increase and enthalpy increase in a radial compressor corresponds
to
ptot ∼(u2

1) + (w2

2) + (c2

3).
(5.12)
Due to their additional signiﬁcant pressure increase in the centrifugal ﬁeld, radial compressors
are predestined for high pressure ratios in a single stage at comparably low ﬂow rates. With that
they are especially well suited for application as exhaust gas turbochargers, mostly designed in a
single-stage layout.
64
Exhaust gas turbocharging
The characteristics of radial compressors and their control possibilities will now be discussed
on the basis of the compressor map.
In the pressure–volume ﬂow diagram, the surge limit was deﬁned as the border to the instable
region of small ﬂow rates and higher pressures. The choke limit is deﬁned as the ﬂow rate limit at
maximum compressor speed.
At the surge limit, the ﬂow in the compressor impeller stalls, resulting in pressure waves in the
charger as well as in the charge air manifold upstream of the compressor, the so-called pumping.
There are several ways to avoid this stalling and thus pumping, which all must aim to design the
inlet into the compressor impeller free of wrong intake (admissions) angles compared to the blade
angle of the impeller. These technical possibilities will be discussed in more detail in Sect.5.4.3.
The choke limit is characterized by the fact that the gas ﬂow in the narrowest area of the
compressor inlet reaches sonic speed. The volume ﬂow cannot be increased even by increasing
the compressor speed. Therefore, all curves of constant compressor speed leading to a higher than
the critical pressure ratio  (see Fig.5.8) approach one maximum ﬂow value at pressure ratio 1.
However, in Sect.5.4.3, a method of inﬂuencing this limit to a small degree will be described.
Figure5.3 shows the most important characteristics, including how the surge limit narrows the
useable map area, the maximum charger speed, and the thus achievable maximum charge pressure,
as well as the choke limit (sonic speed at the compressor inlet).

5.2 Basic ﬂuid mechanics of turbocharger components
65
Because of the signiﬁcant increase in the strength of compressor impeller materials, today
high-performance compressors can be designed with blade ends subjected to high stresses which
are caused by heavy bending instead of pure tension forces. This allows the use of backward bent
compressor blades.
With these, at a given impeller diameter the channel length, i.e., the length between impeller
inlet and outlet, is increased, resulting in an increased pressure gain in the impeller due to the
associated decrease in relative speed of the medium in the blade channel. As a result of this, the
efﬁciencies are better. Further higher pressure ratios as well as wider maps result from an increased
insensibility of the channel ﬂow. Figure5.4 shows a comparison of a compressor map with straight-
ending blades and one with backward bent blades. Today, for high-volume production chargers
used in passenger cars and trucks, backward bent blades are state of the art. For cost reasons, swirl
restrictors and/or vaned diffusers are used only in special applications or for expensive engines.
5.2.3 Turbines
Axial turbine
Similar to axial compressors, the energy gain by pressure and enthalpy reduction can best be
explained for an axial turbine stage (Fig.5.5). Therefore, we will more closely describe the relevant
processes here also using this type of turbine.
From the pitch of the guide vanes it can be seen that, starting with a rectangular intake ﬂow
proﬁle of the gas at a velocity c0, the ﬂow is accelerated to velocity c1 due to the ﬂat outlet angle β1.
For a given circumferential speed u of the turbine, this evolves into the inlet angle of the relative
ﬂow w1 into the turbine rotor. While further accelerating the ﬂow to w2 and c2 in the rotor, energy
is transferred to the rotor. Analogous to the compressor, the ratio between the enthalpy decrease in
the turbine rotor and the entire turbine is again called reaction ratio r.

66
Exhaust gas turbocharging
If the total enthalpy is converted into velocity in the stator, i.e., with a reaction rate of 0, such
conﬁguration is called a straight action turbine.
For axial turbines as well, several stages are possible. They are used for aircraft or stationary
gas turbine applications. For large exhaust gas turbochargers, single-stage axial turbines are state
of the art, for efﬁciency and intake ﬂow reasons (Fig.5.6).
Radial turbine
In the radial turbine, analogous to the radial compressor, the energy conversion occurs also in steps.
At ﬁrst, the exhaust gases are accelerated in the mostly bladeless circular inlet nozzle as part
of the volute according to
p ∼c2
2 −c2

(5.13)
The conversion of this momentum of the gas ﬂow – together with a further pressure decrease in
the rotor – then results in a corresponding gain of mechanical energy due to
–
the pressure reduction in the rotor caused by the increase of the relative velocity w:
p ∼w2

(5.14)
–
and the conversion of the circumferential velocity difference u:
p ∼u2

(5.15)
Figure5.7 shows the velocity triangles of a radial turbine.
Special features of the turbine and its pressure–volume ﬂow map
Here the characteristics of the operating behavior of a turbine will be discussed by means of
the appropriate pressure–volume ﬂow map. This has not yet been discussed, and it has to be

kept in mind that the boundary conditions for the turbine are quite different from those for a
compressor.
–
The volume or mass ﬂow through the turbine is predetermined by the engine. Even more
important, the pressure downstream of the turbine approximates ambient pressure, without
ﬂow limitation by a downstream volume pump, which the engine is on the compressor side.
–
Moreover, varying exhaust gas temperatures occur depending on load and speed of the engine,
which inﬂuence the volume ﬂow through the turbine.
–
Finally, the compressibility of the exhaust gases must be taken into consideration.
Thus, considering the ﬂow conditions given in an exhaust gas turbocharger, characteristic
swallowing lines can be identiﬁed for a turbine which in ﬁrst approximation correspond to those
of an adequate opening or nozzle.
The ﬂow velocity downstream of the cylinder of a reciprocating piston engine – for the sake of
simplicity here assumed without any speed in the cylinder itself – results from the existing enthalpy
difference in the exhaust gas upstream and downstream of this nozzle:
c2
4/2 = h3 −h4 →c4 =

2(h3 −h4).
(5.16)
For ideal gases – assumed here – the following applies:

(5.20)
Inserting these terms into Eq.(5.16), the outlet velocity c4 can be calculated as a function only of

(5.23)
where ψ is the mass ﬂow function already discussed, which only depends on the turbine pressure

This equation, shown in Fig.5.8 for three different κ values, has two zero-crossings, at p4/p3 =
0 and 1. In between it shows a maximum at the so-called critical pressure ratio, which only depends
on the gas condition, which is speciﬁed by the adiabatic exponent κ. If the pressure ratio at the
turbine is kept constant, and thus ψ is constant, the turbine volume ﬂow only depends on the initial
state of the gas upstream of the turbine. With p3v3 = RT3, we get
˙mT = AT,effψp3
	
2
RT3

√T3

(5.24)
From this it follows that at constant pressure p3 upstream of the turbine, the gas mass ﬂowing
through the turbine decreases in relation to 1/
√
T 3. At constant temperature T3, the ﬂow rate is
directly proportional to the pressure p3. With this, pressure and temperature can be eliminated as
parameters in the turbine map to be developed, by “standardizing” the turbine ﬂow rate ˙m with
˙mT = ˙m∗
T · p3

With this conclusion we can derive the turbine map commonly used today. The turbine
characteristic (with ﬁxed geometry) is shown as turbine expansion and pressure ratio against
the ﬂow rate reduced by p3/
√
T 3. A ﬂow curve, the so-called swallowing capacity function of
the turbine, results, which approximates the ﬂow characteristic of an equivalent nozzle area.
Therefore, in an exhaust gas turbocharger the resulting exhaust backpressure and thus the
achievable charge pressure, under consideration of the efﬁciencies, only depend on the turbine
housing area chosen, provided that it represents the ﬂow-limiting nozzle area. This can be seen in
Fig.5.9.
Turbines with variable turbine geometry (vtg charger), which will be discussed later in detail,
have a very wide turbine map, comparable to a compressor map, due to their various positions of
the blades in the turbine inlet guide ring as an additional parameter.

Especially for these, plotting the map similar to the compressor map, i.e., “turbine pressure

The reduced turbine volume ﬂow is that volume ﬂow which the turbine actually handles or must
process – at given pressure and temperature conditions. This kind of mapping was also proposed
by Watson and Janota [147].

Exhaust gas turbocharging
With this way of plotting the map
–
we can chart turbine work curves, e.g., for full-load and part-loads, and
–
we obtain the desired similarity with the compressor map, to support the easier understanding
and descriptiveness of such diagrams, as Fig.5.11 shows.
For these reasons, the presentation of the turbine map as proposed by Watson is very much
recommended.
Characterizing the turbine with an equivalent area or nozzle, and inserting ψmax, which results
in the maximum possible speed at the outlet area, i.e., sonic speed, we get

(5.25)
It can be easily seen that the turbine ﬂow only depends on the gas condition upstream of the turbine
and no longer on the backpressure. In other words, expansion ratios beyond the “critical” ratio,
i.e., greater than 1.8–2.0, seem not to be practical since then the exhaust gas energy can no longer
be utilized completely.
Therefore, from now on we will abandon the hypothesis of the “equivalent nozzle”, due to the
fact that only the particular relative speed in the ﬂow-conducting parts of the turbine is “critical
for sonic speed”.
In a radial turbine rotor the narrowest area is always at the turbine outlet. Since the turbine
rotor operates at considerable circumferential speed, at an exhaust gas temperature of, e.g.,
620 ◦C, an oncoming ﬂow to the rotor accelerated to nearly sonic speed at c1 = 550m/s, and
at a circumferential speed of u1 = 400m/s, the relative intake velocity into the rotor, w1, is only
about 290m/s (Fig.5.12). From this relative intake velocity w1, the medium can now be further
accelerated in the rotor to the sonic speed in the medium as outlet velocity w2.
Starting from a reasonable expansion ratio of about 1.8 for the acceleration in the nozzle,
and further accelerating in the rotor to about the sonic speed of the medium, which is about
580m/s, an additional expansion ratio of 1.6 is obtained, resulting in an “apparent expansion
ratio” of about 3.5, which can be utilized in a single-stage turbine without pressure losses.
Additionally, taking into account pressure losses due to friction of the medium in the inlet guide
vanes and rotor, a maximum expansion ratio of about 4 can be achieved in a single-stage radial
turbine.
In axial turbines it is possible to obtain supersonic speeds in the inlet guide vanes and to utilize
these velocities in an action turbine (Laval turbine). In practice, the conditions in the turbine are
even more complex, since with pulse turbocharging, transient pressure conditions exist during the
exhaust strokes of the cylinders of the engine (Fig.5.13).
Thus we have to note that the rather simple mapping of the turbine operational characteristics

with this turbine swallowing capacity function enables just a rough description of its mean operation
behavior and is therefore only of very limited value for detailed turbine layout as required today.
Both in stationary engine operation and, especially, during transient engine processes, the turbine
is operated under conditions which can no longer be characterized with sufﬁcient accuracy by such
a simple function.
Although the mean turbine speed changes only slightly, the instantaneous turbine speed as
well as operating points signiﬁcantly deviate from the corresponding average values because of
the widely varying pressures and mass or volume ﬂows. For the map diagram this means that the
corresponding operating points are no longer located on this mean swallowing capacity function.
Consequently, the map must be shown in an extended operating area (Fig.5.14).
The measurement of such maps is very complex and must be performed at special turbocharger
test benches, on which the exhaust gas turbocharger cannot be operated in the steady-state operating
points only, i.e., in power equilibrium with the compressor. Rather, it is necessary signiﬁcantly to
be able to freely adjust pressure, temperature, and mass ﬂow conditions both on the compressor
side (Fig.5.15) as well as on the turbine side (Fig.5.16).
Such extended maps – instead of the mean swallowing capacity functions for ﬁxed-geometry
turbines and a corresponding map for turbines with variable geometry – are of the utmost signiﬁ-
cance, especially for correct thermodynamic cycle simulations.

Similar to those of compressors, and corresponding to the turbine layout, these maps show
different characteristics:
–
for axial turbines, the map width is very narrow (Fig.5.17),
–
for radial turbines, the map is signiﬁcantly wider because of the varying centripetal forces at
different speeds (Fig.5.18).

In summary, the characteristics of turbines are as follows.
Turbines, like compressors, can be described in maps which show differing characteristics
depending on their layout.
Atsteady-stateengineoperation,underconsiderationofmeanexhaustgasvolumeﬂowsandtur-
bine pressure ratios, the turbocharger operates only in a very narrow map area, the so-called turbine
swallowing capacity function.
For cycle simulations – especially of transient engine operating conditions – the complete tur-
bine map must be taken into account.
For a ﬁrst coarse layout of exhaust gas turbochargers, the mean turbine swallowing capacity
function may be used with sufﬁcient accuracy.
Turbines with variable geometry can be treated like a band of ﬁxed-geometry chargers. Their
operating behavior can be described by a corresponding number of maps or mean swallowing
capacity functions, each for a speciﬁc blade position.
The compilation of the mean swallowing capacity functions of a turbine with variable geometry
results in an extended map, in which the engine operating points and thus the corresponding blade
positions can be displayed.

5.3 Energy balance of the charging system
Simply by coupling a ﬂow compressor with a ﬂow turbine on a common shaft and supplying this
turbine with engine exhaust gas, exhaust gas turbocharging generates charge pressure without a
mechanical connection to the engine. There exists a thermodynamic coupling. The turbocharger
is freely spinning and the charger speed adjusts itself corresponding to the respective power
equilibrium between compressor (PC) and turbine (PT). Thus, the attainable charge pressure is
also subject to these equilibrium conditions.

Pfr of an actual charger (bearings, shaft seals, etc.), and

A few additional, general turbocharger characteristics which can be seen in the pressure–volume
ﬂow map should be mentioned.
The charger speed and thus the charge pressure is not related to the engine speed. It increases
with increasing turbine power, i.e., with increasing exhaust gas ﬂow rate and increasing exhaust
gas temperature (energy supply to the turbine).
In an exhaust gas turbocharger, a change in charge pressure can be achieved only by a change
in charger speed. This means that for any increase of the charge pressure, ﬁrst the charger has to
be accelerated via additional power to be generated by the turbine.
5.4 Matching of the turbocharger
5.4.1 Possibilities for the use of exhaust energy and the resulting
exhaust system design
As mentioned in Sect.3.2.3, exhaust gas turbocharging is the preferred method for utilizing the
remaining energy in the cylinder charge at the end of the expansion stroke.
The most commonly used methods are constant-pressure turbocharging and pulse turbocharg-
ing, combined with a corresponding layout of the exhaust system.
76
Exhaust gas turbocharging
Constant-pressure turbocharging
Figure5.19 shows the pV diagram for the high-pressure cycle, as well as for the compressor and
turbine work for this application. Due to the approximately constant exhaust gas backpressure, it
exhibits the simplest thermodynamic conditions and is therefore especially suited for a discussion
of the basic relations.
For this type of exhaust gas turbocharging, a correspondingly dimensioned plenum is located
between the exhaust ports of the individual cylinders, designed to dampen exhaust pressure pulses
occurring at “outlet valve opening”. Thus the turbine will be admitted with exhaust gas pressure and
temperature as constant as possible, i.e., constant energy ﬂow. However, in this case the area 4–5–1,
which contains the dynamic energy fraction, obviously cannot be utilized. On the other hand, due
to the time-constant exhaust gas mass ﬂow ( ˙m ≈const.), the turbine swallowing capacity can be
comparably small, and good turbine efﬁciencies can be achieved.
If in ﬁrst approximation the charge pressure p2 is set equal to the pressure in the exhaust
system (p2 = p3), the engine is always operated at a higher pressure level. The power required to
drive the compressor is generated by the turbine. However, since the exhaust gas temperature
at “outlet valve opening” is much higher than the compressor intake temperature, a larger
volume is expanded in the turbine (V ∼T). Theoretically – at identical pressure drop as in the
compressor (p3/p4 = p2/p1) – a larger turbine power could be generated than the compressor
needs. Conversely, this means that, depending on the efﬁciency of the charger, p2 will be higher than
p3, thus creating a so-called positive scavenging pressure gradient during the valve overlap phase
[101].

ratio between cylinder pressure pcyl and plenum pressure p3 upstream of the turbine. The basis for
this diagram are the assumptions of a heat-insulated exhaust system and a mean speciﬁc enthalpy
h0 for the total exhaust gas mass ﬂowing out of the cylinder. An important fact shown in this
diagram is that, due to the ﬂow processes from the cylinder to the exhaust plenum, besides pressure
losses and the loss of momentum, a signiﬁcant increase in entropy occurs.
As a consequence, instead of an isentropic expansion to ambient pressure with a theoretically
available enthalpy difference hs-i,cyl, only the smaller enthalpy gradient hs-i,T is available for the
turbine. Of this – due to turbine losses – only hT can be utilized for the generation of compressor
power. The inferior utilization of the exhaust gas enthalpy is, however, at least partially compensated
for by better turbine efﬁciencies [101].
Figure5.21 shows in principle how this can be achieved, on the one hand with respect to a
certain layout and dimensioning of the exhaust manifold, on the other with given exhaust gas
temperatures and turbocharger total efﬁciencies. Calculated exhaust gas charge pressure ratios,
depending on charger efﬁciencies and exhaust gas temperatures, are shown in Fig.5.22.
However, a serious disadvantage of constant-pressure turbocharging is the fact that with any
change in the operating condition of the engine, the large exhaust plenum has to be brought to the
new pressure and temperature level, which leads to signiﬁcant problems under transient operating
conditions.
The advantages of constant-pressure turbocharging are
–
a simple exhaust system for multicylinder engines and
–
low fuel consumption due to low gas exchange work.
Nowadays, the major application of constant-pressure turbocharging is in highly charged slow-
speed engines in stationary use and with load patterns where transient operation is either modest
or not relevant.
Pulse turbocharging
Pulse turbocharging, shown in Fig.5.23 in the pV diagram, utilizes – additionally to the quasi-static
energy (pressure and temperature) – the kinetic energy in the exhaust gas, present in the form of
pressure waves from the blow down pulses. In this case, the admission into the turbine occurs with
variable exhaust gas pressures and temperatures, i.e., under transient conditions.
The pV diagram could be interpreted in such a way that there would be no backpressure of the
exhaust gas if the enthalpy h4, present in the exhaust gas at “outlet valve opening”, were completely
converted into kinetic energy, i.e., exhaust ﬂow velocity, and subsequently processed in an action
turbine. In comparison to constant-pressure turbocharging this represents a gain, since an isentropic
expansion is performed instead of the irreversible throttling to the turbine inlet pressure level in
the plenum. However, the advantage of this process cannot be fully utilized, due to both the losses
in the exhaust valve gap and the lower turbine efﬁciencies caused by transient gas admission to the
turbine offside the turbine peak efﬁciency.

An examination of the processes in the hs diagram (Fig.5.24) shows more details. Due to the
supercritical pressure ratio between cylinder and exhaust manifold pcyl/p3, the exhaust ﬂow at the
valve gap reaches sonic speed and the pressure drops to pEx. Thus, with reduced throttling losses,
5.4 Matching of the turbocharger
79
an increased fraction hT of the theoretical enthalpy gradient hs-i can be utilized. The inferior
turbine efﬁciencies, caused by irregular gas admission, are overcompensated by the higher energy
content of the ﬂow pulses [101].
Advantages for pulse turbocharging in comparison to constant-pressure turbocharging can be
achieved
–
in its thermodynamic behavior – however, these advantages decrease with increasing charge
rate (Fig.5.25);
–
especially in transient engine operation, due to signiﬁcantly improved acceleration behavior
of the turbocharger and consequently the entire engine.
Nowadays, the major application area for pulse turbocharging is in engines with mostly transient
operation, i.e., primarily in automobile engines.
Exhaust system
Toincorporatethedescribedexhaustgasturbochargingversionsintoenginedesign,acorresponding
layout and dimensioning of the exhaust system is necessary. The goal of its layout is to improve
the utilization of the exhaust gas energy as much as possible. In the case of constant-pressure
turbocharging, main objective is a pressure recovery as good as possible. In the case of pulse
turbocharging, main objective is the best possible conversion of the pressure pulses into kinetic
energy with minimum losses.
The ﬁrst exhaust gas turbocharged engines were designed with a common exhaust manifold,
i.e., with constant-pressure turbocharging. A breakthrough in design was achieved with the
implementation of Buechi’s patent (drp 568855) by splitting up manifolds and combining certain
cylinders, which is of major importance for automotive applications. According to this patent,
exhaust manifold and intake area into the exhaust gas turbine must be designed and the valve
timing chosen such that at the beginning of the exhaust process the pressure in the exhaust manifold
after the opening of the exhaust valve (blow down pulse) is higher than the pressure in the intake
manifold, i.e., higher than the charge pressure. However, towards the end of the exhaust process,
the exhaust manifold pressure must fall below the charge pressure.
In four-stroke engines this results in a total exhaust valve opening period of 260 to 300◦crank
angle (ca) before the next cylinder may exhaust into the same exhaust port. In practice, this
interval can be somewhat shorter, due to wave propagation times and the delay of the blow down
pulse. Ideal conditions for pulse turbocharging are therefore obtained using a ﬁring distance of
240◦ca for four-stroke engines, and of 120◦ca for two-stroke engines, within one manifold
branch.
For the four- and six-cylinder engines with pulse turbocharging, today predominantly used
in automobile engines, this requires a twin-ﬂow exhaust gas manifold arrangement. For a
nine-cylinder engine, common in shipbuilding, a triple-ﬂow arrangement accordingly would be
necessary.
For multipulse layouts, the rule for minimum ﬁring distance discussed above results in the
following layout variants:
–
four-cylinder engine, twin-ﬂow layout with a turbine housing divided into two branches;
–
eight-cylinder engine with one turbocharger, quadruple-ﬂow layout with a turbine housing
divided into four branches;
–
eight-cylinder engine with two turbochargers, quadruple-ﬂow layout with turbine housings
divided into two branches;
–
ﬁve-cylinder engine with symmetric ﬁring order, triple-ﬂow layout.

Figure5.26 shows examples for manifold arrangements and cylinder combinations for four-
stroke inline engines, as well as the associated exhaust gas and charge pressure curves.
Besides combining the manifolds of certain cylinders, there is an additional method of utilizing
the gas dynamics of the exhaust process which avoids the disadvantages of pulse pressure turbo-
charging, e.g., its inferior turbine efﬁciency.
This method is the pulse converter. The pulse converter also uses narrow exhaust gas manifolds
which are combined exactly as for pulse turbocharging. However, here they are not channeled into
separate turbine branches but are combined in the pulse converter.
In the pulse converter, the pressure energy present in the particular outlet ﬂow is converted
into kinetic energy by narrowing the manifold area and thus accelerating the velocity of the par-
ticular exhaust gas mass ﬂow. Thus, the pressure differences between the individual manifold
lines are reduced. In this way, a kind of injector effect is achieved which prevents the return of
the pressure waves into the other manifold branches and thus interference with the scavenging
process. Downstream of the pulse converter, the kinetic energy is exchanged among the pulses of the
individual cylinders, and can be regained into pressure energy in a subsequent diffuser (Fig.5.26).

For efﬁciency reasons, in most cases this pressure recovery is not utilized, but the turbine is
designed more as an action turbine. The improved efﬁciency results from a more uniform ﬂow
admission into the turbine. Figure5.27 shows such a pulse converter, both with and without a
diffuser for pressure recovery.
5.4.2 Turbine design and control
Design via nomograms
In the past, for the selection of the turbine rotor and its dimensions the following rough approxi-
mation via nomograms was used: The particular volume ﬂow ˙V is determined from the pressure–
volume ﬂow map of the engine to be supercharged (for new designs one can take the displacement
and the desired speed range), for both the lowest and the highest full-load speed, possibly also
for one or two intermediate engine speeds, and under estimation of the necessary charge pressure.
These values are then used as entry into the nomograms shown in Fig.5.28.

83
The charge pressure conditions for the selected speeds obtained this way can now be correlated
with the initial estimates and corrected. It is obvious that such a rough, iterative process can no
longer satisfy today’s demands for the layout of the supercharging system for a new engine. This is
especially true if, e.g., in the case of pulse turbocharging, the exhaust manifolds have to be dimen-
sioned and combined under consideration of gas dynamics. Accordingly, nowadays numeric
simulation processes are utilized for the layout of supercharging systems.
Turbine selection via actual thermodynamic process simulation and maps
The physical basics and the corresponding mathematical models for such thermodynamic cycle
simulation programs were presented in Sect. 3.6 in detail.
For an actual exhaust gas turbocharger layout, ﬁrst the complete engine is modeled and then the
engine air requirement at the turbine design point is determined from the desired air-to-fuel ratio
(this will differ depending on the combustion process). In doing so, values for volumetric efﬁcien-
cy and speciﬁc fuel consumption are taken from similar engines and adjusted to the engine displace-
ment. Additionally, a ﬁrst estimation can be made for the necessary compressor pressure ratio (if
need be, considering charge air cooler pressure losses).
With this value, a cycle simulation can be started in the design point, using estimated turbo-
chargerefﬁciencies.Consideringthenecessarypowerequilibriumbetweencompressorandturbine,
the equivalent turbine area is adapted in iterative steps until the compressor reaches the desired
pressure ratio. Once this is done for several operating points in the map of the engine to be adapted,
the exhaust gas turbocharger dimensions can be scaled – again starting with actual charger data from
a similar engine, and then entering geometric changes of both compressor and turbine dimensions
(Fig.5.29) – i.e., its main dimensions can be speciﬁed, which will already be very close to the
actual design. For three speciﬁc cases taken from Fig.5.29, Fig.5.30 shows the resulting charger
performance data for speciﬁc scaling coefﬁcients.

Possibilities for matching the turbine
In today’s exhaust gas turbochargers of high-volume series production, usually a radial turbine is
applied. Therefore its free parameters are similar to those of a radial compressor. Figure5.31 shows
the most important major dimensions of a single-ﬂow radial turbine.
For the ﬁrst rough selection of the housing, the characteristic housing area AVolute at the inlet
to the volute is of great importance for the achievable turbine power.
Additionally, the so-called A/R ratio is used for characterization of the housing identiﬁcation.
A/R describes the ratio between the turbine entry cross-sectional area A (cm2) at the transition
from the turbine inlet area into the volute and the radius R (cm), which is deﬁned as the distance
from the center of the shaft to a theoretical mean ﬂow path in the ﬂow channel, by which the mass
ﬂow is halved (see Fig.5.31 with AS/RS). A/R therefore is a measure for the ﬂow capacity of the
turbine housing. In divided turbine housings (e.g., twin-ﬂow housing), A is the sum of both channel
areas. A/R has to be considered together with the so-called trim of the turbine.
Trim denotes the tuning of the contour of a turbine rotor for a speciﬁed ﬂow range. The trim
and the A/R ratio together fully characterize the swallowing capacity of the turbine for a constant
rotor diameter (Fig.5.32). Numerically, trim is deﬁned as
T = (d/D)2 · 100,
(5.34)
i.e., the ratio between the squares of two diameters, rotor outer diameter d and turbine rotor gas
outlet diameter D.
The compressor impeller-to-turbine rotor diameter ratio DC/DT is another main parameter
identifying the behavior of exhaust gas turbochargers. The turbine rotor diameter is chosen in such
a way that for a speciﬁed compressor performance the turbine operates at best efﬁciency.

This can be done by plotting the turbine efﬁciencies against the so-called turbine blade speed
ratio, deﬁned as the ratio between the circumferential rotor speed u and the theoretical gas expansion
velocity c0 which would be achieved if the exhaust gas were expanding without losses, in a nozzle,
from the turbine inlet pressure p3 to the static turbine outlet pressure p4stat.
Figure5.33 shows the efﬁciency behavior of a radial turbine in such a diagram, i.e., it shows the
isentropic turbine efﬁciency depending on the blade speed ratio S: S = u/c0. In this special case, c0
describes a particle velocity and the letter u was chosen to be comparable with the internationally
used notation of S.

Fig. 5.35. Flow losses of a turbine
Figure5.35 shows the ﬂow losses occurring in a turbine. For smaller exhaust gas turbocharger
turbines, the gap between rotor and housing represents a noticeable fraction of the total losses. For
turbines operated in a wide operating range, the ﬂow angles at the turbine inlet can signiﬁcantly
deviate from the optimum values, resulting in admission losses and ﬂow separation losses in the
turbine rotor (Fig.5.36).
In smaller turbines, which mostly are equipped with waste gates and therefore have smaller
turbine housing areas, friction losses also have a noticeable effect. Especially if the kinetic
energy (present in the form of pressure waves) in the exhaust ﬂow is of importance, for particu-
lar engine designs this can be achieved most effectively if a so-called twin-ﬂow turbine is uti-
lized. In such a turbine, the housing is separated into two symmetric inlet volutes, creating a
ﬂow division (Fig.5.37a). In contrast, double-ﬂow housings (Fig.5.37b) are only used for special
applications.
Layout and calculation of such a system, which has extremely effective ﬂow dynamics, requires
knowledge of the ﬂow characteristics of twin-ﬂow housings under transient operating conditions.
This has to be obtained using sophisticated measurement techniques, and the recent emphasis
on further improved efﬁciency of modern turbocharged engines has led to increasing interest in
this type of turbochargers. Figure5.38 shows a comparison between the ﬂow characteristics of
double-ﬂow and twin-ﬂow turbine housings for the case of nonsymmetric admission. Nowadays,
better measurement techniques, as well as more precise simulation software tools are available

for layout and tuning. This makes it possible to describe multiﬂow turbine housings, and their
nonsymmetric admission in the case of pulse turbocharging, with sufﬁcient accuracy, and to
characterize them via actually measured values.
However, with constant-pressure turbocharging the critical high pressure ratios mentioned
above cannot be reached in the turbine only. In this case the design target may be met by utilizing
a diffuser downstream of the turbine which allows to increase the expansion ratio in the turbine
by means of pressure recovery downstream of the turbine, which results in improved turbine
efﬁciencies (Fig.5.39).
In addition, circumferentially sectional admissions utilizing double-ﬂow or even triple-ﬂow
volute housings nowadays are common especially for medium-speed engines. For slow-speed
engines, for the most part axial turbines (diameter larger than 700mm) are utilized as the charger
drive, and sectional admissions are state of the art. Here too, the software programs mentioned are
an indispensable part of the development tools.
5.4.3 Compressor design and control
Compressor selection
To enable the selection and match of a compressor, standardized compressor maps are available
from the various compressor manufacturers. Figure5.3 displays an example of such a map. In
most cases, theoretical engine swallowing capacity functions for four-stroke engines are also
shown in these maps, so that the compressor selection can be made on the basis of the following
criteria:
–
in the lower speed range of the engine, sufﬁcient clearance to the surge limit,
–
athighenginespeeds,sufﬁcientclearancetothemaximumspeedofthecompressor,considering
a reserve for operation at high altitude (Fig.5.40).
A more precise compressor selection can be made via numeric simulations. Starting with a known
compressor map and knowing the exact engine data, the ideal compressor size for a speciﬁc engine
can be determined utilizing the scaling method described in Sect.5.4.2, i.e., by changing the
compressor dimensions in percentage increments. With these data, a suitable compressor can be

Compressor control possibilities
Inmostcases,theuseofacompressorwithoutcontrolfeaturesissufﬁcientforbothstationaryengine
and automobile use. With increasingly higher charge pressure ratios and additionally increased
speed ranges under load, the limits for compressors without controls have now essentially been
reached. For a turbo compressor, then, basically the following possibilities for inﬂuencing the
operating map exist: preswirl control, ﬂow stabilizing measures, adjustable diffusers and adjustable
compressor blades.
For preswirl control, the admission angle into the compressor impeller is varied with the help
of – ideally, continuously adjustable – inlet guide blades, and thus the onﬂowing air is forced into
a preswirl. Figure5.41 shows such a device with adjustable guide blades.
Since all the inlet and outlet angles of the compressor can be designed free of pulses for only a
particular ﬂow rate, with its relevant speed and pressure ratio values, it is obvious that the admis-
sion conditions can be adjusted via a preswirl in or against the turning direction of the compressor
impeller. This also reduces the danger of stalling, i.e., the surge limit is shifted, as clearly demon-
strated in Fig.5.42. This measure is especially effective at high pressure ratios.
In addition, the surge limit can be shifted “to the left” via a specially designed recirculation
from “upstream of compressor impeller outlet” to the compressor inlet, which nowadays is termed
a ﬂow-stabilizing measure. Figure5.43 shows such an arrangement which above all may also
help to eliminate ﬂow rate problems. Here, at low ﬂow rates a recirculation occurs around the
compressor, resulting in an effectively higher ﬂow rate and thus improved oncoming ﬂow to the
blades of the impeller. At high ﬂow rates, this bypass acts as an additional compressor ﬂow area,
resulting in a higher possible ﬂow rate before reaching the choke limit.
The same applies for an outlet diffuser equipped with ﬁxed or adjustable blades (Fig.5.44).
Here the volume ﬂow of the compressor and its limits can be inﬂuenced in a wide range by the
choice of the blade angle (Fig.5.45). In general, the following rule applies: The steeper the outlet
angle, the higher the ﬂow rate through the compressor (ﬂow area) and the smaller the pressure
gain.

Both preswirl control and diffuser blade pitch control – preferably in combination – are suited
to noticeably expand the usable map of ﬂow compressors. Thus, such compressors are suited for
high degrees of supercharging in applications with a wide ﬂow rate range, i.e., wide usable speed
range of the engine.
Compressor blade pitch control is only possible for axial compressors; this is not uti-
lized, however, even for the turbochargers of large combustion engines due to installed size and
costs.

5.5 Layout and optimization of the gas manifolds and the turbocharger
components by means of cycle and CFD simulations
5.5.1 Layout criteria
For engines with exhaust gas turbocharging, the tasks of thermodynamic cycle simulations during
the layout process can be subdivided into the following three areas (besides the engine itself, which
was discussed earlier):
–
intake system (manifolds, ﬁlter, charge air cooler, egr inductor, mufﬂer)
–
exhaust system (manifolds, catalysts, particulate ﬁlter, mufﬂer, egr tubing)
–
charge system (compressors, turbines, compound turbines, waste gate)
Besides inﬂuencing the engine itself, the manifolds of supercharged engines also inﬂuence the
operating behavior of the compressor decisively. High pressure losses within the charge air system,
upstream and downstream of the compressor, increase the pressure ratio necessary to achieve a
desired charge pressure level. Figure5.46a shows the consequences of such increased pressure
losses and, thus, pressure ratios for the compressor operating conditions (pressure loss of case B
greater than case A).
In the lower speed range, where automotive engines are operated at full-load close to the surge
limit of the compressor, higher pressure losses result in a shift of the engine full-load operating curve

towards this limit. This can have a negative effect on the operating safety of the compressor. At high
engine speeds close to the rated power, the operating range of the compressor is restricted by the
choke limit. Additionally, the mechanical speed limit of the charger is approached. Furthermore,
higher pressure losses may cause the maximum charger speed (e.g., at high-altitude operation) to be
unacceptably approached or even exceeded and thus may limit the operating safety of the charger

Fig. 5.47. Inﬂuence of pressure losses on the intake side on brake

under these conditions. And ﬁnally, the higher compressor pressure ratios require increased drive
power, which usually by itself requires higher turbine pressure ratios.
This results in increased exhaust work for the engine, reducing the mean effective pressure
in the engine due to pressure losses both on the intake and on the exhaust side. This is shown
in Fig.5.47 for a turbocharged engine at rated power. To compensate for these losses, at a given
air-to-fuel ratio for a speciﬁed combustion process, even more charge pressure is required. In this
way, a closed feedback loop of all the negative inﬂuences of higher pressure losses on the intake
side is formed, which ampliﬁes its initial disadvantage.
For this reason, for a turbocharged engine as well, the aim is to have minimum pressure losses
on the intake side, i.e., the charger cannot simply compensate for these losses. Besides minimizing
pressure losses, it is also important to design the piping for optimum ﬂow conditions, especially
close to the compressor intake. At this point a speed proﬁle as uniform as possible should be
aimed at.
Additionally, unintentional or uncontrolled swirls at the compressor intake must be avoided,
since they inﬂuence the velocity proﬁles and triangles at impeller blade entry and thus inﬂuence
the compressor operating conditions or the corresponding efﬁciencies. This fact can be indirectly
measured via the compressor outlet temperature. If it is signiﬁcantly higher than that derived from
intake temperature, map efﬁciency, and Eq.(2.14), the ﬂow entry into the compressor has to be
analyzed in detail.
For engines with charge air cooling, upstream of the compressor the charge air cooler has to
be dimensioned (rating of the required cooling capacity under consideration of the temperature
increase in the compressor and the simulated engine mass ﬂow at rated power). Further, the effect of
various cooler layouts – characterized, e.g., by their corresponding charge air cooler efﬁciencies –
has to be analyzed.
On the exhaust side, special attention has to be paid to the optimum conversion of the
exhaust gas energy in the turbine(s). That is, the pressure and wall heat losses between engine
and turbine must be minimized. As an example, on the engine side the exhaust ports may be
insulated with “port liners”. The manifolds themselves are often designed double-walled, with
air gap insulation. This keeps the exhaust gas temperatures upstream of the turbine at high
levels, which are necessary for early catalyst light off and efﬁcient working temperatures. Further,
it minimizes the heat radiation into the engine compartment, which in most cases is narrow and
poorly ventilated.
5.5 Layout and optimization
95
With regard to the geometric layout of the exhaust manifolds, several observations must be
made. On the one hand, short manifold lengths and compact areas transfer the kinetic energy of
the exhaust pulses optimally to the turbine. Depending on the engine layout and the ﬁring order,
this may result in a disadvantage for the gas exchange of the engine itself. Also, with increasing
gas ﬂows the narrow areas result in signiﬁcantly increasing pressure losses. Correspondingly, for
automotive engines a compromise has to be found between, on the one hand, sufﬁcient charge
pressure buildup and good response at lower speeds and under transient conditions and, on the
other hand, acceptable speciﬁc fuel consumption values at high speeds.
Figures5.48 and 5.49 show the results of such an analysis. In Fig.5.48, the speciﬁc fuel
consumption at rated power (stationary operation) is plotted in relation to the relative exhaust
manifold diameter. In Fig.5.49, the engine response is plotted for two different exhaust manifold
diameters.
Similar to the intake side, downstream of the turbine minimum pressure losses have to be
aimed at, since, at a given required turbine pressure ratio, otherwise the absolute exhaust gas
backpressure increases, and with it exhaust pumping work and fuel consumption. The turbine
itself must now be dimensioned in such a manner that sufﬁcient power is generated in the complete
engine operating range to drive the compressor such that the required degree of supercharging
is achieved. In doing this, the most important layout criterion for automotive propulsion is the
achievable charge pressure in the speed range below maximum torque. For chargers with ﬁxed
geometry, the design point must be ﬁxed in this speed range. For vtg chargers, the turbine size

has to be optimized with regard to its swallowing capacity and its turbine efﬁciency in this speed
range.
On the other hand, for stationary applications mainly with operation near full-load (trucks,
generator sets), speciﬁc fuel consumption and compliance with emission standards are the most
important design criteria for the turbocharging system. Accordingly, in these cases the design has
to aim at the best possible total system efﬁciencies under these load conditions. Thus, the turbine
conﬁguration has to be optimized in regard to efﬁciency, achievable charge pressure and thus com-
bustion air-to-fuel ratio, and minimum turbine inlet pressure for best possible gas exchange work.
After engine and turbocharging components have been designed in respect to their
thermodynamics, detailed engineering can start. Normally, during the actual realization of the

design, detail optimizations become necessary that exceed the prediction capabilities of 1-D cycle
simulations.
The 3-D cfd simulation which is then necessary covers all gas-containing components, e.g.,
the charge air manifold with the charge air cooler (Fig.5.50), the intake air plenum (Fig.5.51), the
internal ﬂow within the cylinder including variable parameters like pistons and valves (Fig.5.52),
and the exhaust manifold (Figs.5.53 and 5.54).
5.5.2 Examples of numeric simulation of engines
with exhaust gas turbocharging
4-cylinder, 4-valve gasoline engine with ﬁxed-geometry turbocharger
and waste gate (2.0 liter displacement)
The mathematical model shown in Fig.5.55 covers the manifold between exhaust valves
and turbocharger with pipe elements. The actual design of the ﬁxed-geometry turbine of the
turbocharger includes an integrated waste gate (turbine bypass for charge pressure control) in
such a way that the gas paths are very similar for the partial mass ﬂows through the turbine and
through the waste gate.
In the lower speed range as well as under part-load operation, whenever the waste gate is closed,
the turbine on the exhaust side can be described completely by its turbine map.
However, in operating points in which the waste gate is opened, the swallowing capacity
of the turbine seems to be increased, since a part of the mass ﬂow is channeled through the
waste gate. At the same time, the virtual turbine efﬁciency – which is related to the complete
mass ﬂow – is reduced, since only a part of the gas ﬂow is utilized to perform work in the
turbine.
Therefore, in the mathematical model a waste gate element must be placed parallel to the
turbine and between exhaust manifold and downstream exhaust pipe. As in the real component, via
a differential pressure sensor, a spring, and the anticipated attenuation characteristic, this simulates
the position of the control valve and thus its ﬂow capacity (Fig.5.56).
Experience proves that this approach is associated with signiﬁcant additional measurement
complexity (spring and attenuation characteristics, ﬂow coefﬁcient of the waste gate valve), and

the calibration of the mathematical model is very time-consuming. It is more practical to utilize the
compressor’s pressure ratios, either known (from measurements) or as desired, as control variables
for the turbine waste gate mass ﬂow. With these values, and the compressor mass ﬂow actually
calculated within the process simulation, the required turbine power and, thus, also the waste gate
ﬂow rate are known. In this way, even without exactly knowing the position of the control valve,
an adequate accuracy of the simulation can be achieved. However, if there is a need to get speciﬁc
data relating to the operating behavior of the valve (dynamics, impact due to exhaust pulsations,
etc.), an exact modeling is mandatory.
On the fresh air intake side, gasoline engines normally need a compressor bypass valve as well –
also called air circulation valve. It is not utilized for charge pressure control, however, but it is
opened during negative load variations, in order to allow appreciable compressor mass ﬂows when
the engine’s throttle is closed. It has to be considered that at a sudden closing of the throttle, due to
its inertia the charger decelerates only slowly, while the compressor mass ﬂow rapidly decreases
corresponding to the new throttle position. This would cause the compressor to stall, possibly
causing bearing damage. A sufﬁcient mass ﬂow can be assured with the air circulation valve, so
that the operating points in the compressor map stay in the stable range even during negative load
variations.
6-cylinder, 4-valve di diesel engine with vtg (2.5 liter displacement)
The increasing requirements put on supercharging systems, i.e., the achievement of high charge
pressures in a wide engine speed range, have led to the development of exhaust gas turbines with
variable turbine inlet geometry, i.e., with variable swallowing capacity. Figure5.57 shows the
numeric model of a direct-injection diesel engine with such a turbocharger.
In the simulation model itself, this variability is represented by a set of turbine maps, each
characterizing a distinct geometric position of the turbine. Typically, the maps are measured in ﬁve
steps, from “fully closed” via “1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 opened” to “fully opened” (Fig.5.58). In order to
be able to calculate the required characteristic data (swallowing capacity and efﬁciency) from the
maps, during cycle simulation additionally the actual turbine inlet guide blade position has to be
deﬁned.

Referring to the simulation model shown in Fig.5.57, it has to be noted that the pipe elements
connectingtheexhaustgasandfreshairsidesrepresenttheexhaustgasrecirculationmanifold.Since
exhaust gas recirculation only occurs in emissions-relevant map areas, in passenger car engines
this component has practically no inﬂuence on the full-load performance of the turbocharger.
6-cylinder, 4-valve di diesel engine with twin-ﬂow turbine (12 liter displacement)
Unlike the passenger car, under actual driving conditions the truck engine is very often operated
close to full load. Thus, emissions-reducing measures as well, especially exhaust gas recirculation,
must be correctly simulated under full-load conditions. Figure5.59 shows the simulation model of
a 12 liter truck engine with egr.
Depending on the engine layout and the ﬁring order, the pulse energy of the blow down pulses of
the individual cylinders can be better utilized in the turbine if the exhaust manifolds are combined
accordingly – in the case of the 6-cylinder engine, one manifold for cylinders 1, 2, and 3, as well as
a separate manifold for cylinders 4, 5, and 6. The two ﬂows in these manifolds inﬂuence each other

when they meet at the impeller inlet. In order to correctly reﬂect this behavior, the turbine map
must be described in a way that simulates a partial connection. This can be done by considering
the efﬁciencies and ﬂow resistances as a function of the individual manifold mass ﬂow conditions
(see Sect.5.4.2). Figure5.60 shows efﬁciency and ﬂow maps for a twin-ﬂow turbine.
A further special feature of the numeric model shown is the exhaust gas recirculation unit. It
consists of the connecting line between exhaust gas manifold and intake system, the egr cooler,
the control valve, and the egr inductor. This inductor can be designed, e.g., as a Venturi injector,
enabling egr into the intake system even at positive static pressure differences between the intake
and exhaust manifolds (Fig.5.61). The geometrical optimization of such an injector is a typical

5.5.3 Veriﬁcation of the simulation
The veriﬁcation of the simulation models can only be performed via a comparison of engine test
bench measurements with the corresponding simulation results. The standard measurements re-
corded on engine test benches can serve for this task: engine speed, air volume ﬂow, medium
temperatures per cycle, medium static pressures, fuel consumption, blowby mass ﬂow, and emission
data.
Especially for supercharged engines, the following additional measurement data should be
collected for veriﬁcation purposes:
cylinder pressure curves (high-pressure indications),
indicated pressure curves (against crank angle) in the intake and exhaust systems (low-pressure
indications),
ignition timing and injection nozzle needle stroke,
turbocharger speed.
Figure5.62 shows a compilation of the measured and the simulated steady state full-load
operating data of the passenger car di diesel engine with variable turbine geometry discussed in
Sect.5.5.2.
In general, well executed simulation models can reproduce actual engine operating data in the
complete map with a maximum deviation of 2%. It is important to check the model calibration in
the complete map, or at least in the total speed range at full load. Figure5.62 shows a comparison

engine with vtg.
The correct measurement of the gasdynamic processes in the intake and exhaust systems of
such an engine can now be made by means of the pressure indications mentioned above. The gas
exchange is of special interest, since it decisively inﬂuences – via the gas exchange work (integral
of p dV during the gas exchange) – the quality and quantity of the cylinder charge and of the
subsequent high-pressure process. Figure5.63 shows comparisons between such measured and
simulated pressure curves for the engine just mentioned.
As a basis for the optimization of transient processes, and to analyze the inﬂuence of individual
parameters during load changes, it is additionally necessary to validate the transient behavior of a

simulation model by means of measurement data. To make this possible, all mechanical inertias
of the turbocharger’s rotating assembly as well as the gasdynamic and thermal inertia effects have
to be modeled correctly. Especially the thermal behavior of the exhaust gas manifolds between
cylinder and turbine inﬂuences the transient response of the exhaust gas turbine.
For the same passenger car di diesel engine, Fig.5.64 shows a comparison between the
measured operating data during a load change and corresponding simulation data. The simulations
must be able to follow the changes in the combustion characteristics during the load change.
The correct acceleration characteristic of the turbocharger, and thus the response of the engine,
can only be simulated with correctly modeled thermal inertia effects of the exhaust manifold. When
modeling these effects, material and layout of the manifolds have to be considered (cast, steel pipe,
double-wall air gap-insulated pipes, conditions for convection at the pipe surfaces).
6 Special processes with use of exhaust
gas turbocharging
6.1 Two-stage turbocharging
Nowadays, most compressor impellers are made of aluminum. Their endurance strength allows
circumferential speeds of about 520m/s and thus pressure ratios of about 4.5. In exhaust gas
turbochargers for slow-speed engines, pressure ratios of more than 5 are obtained through the use
of titanium impellers, which allow even higher circumferential speeds. If the objective is to achieve
even higher pressure ratios, and with them engine mean effective pressure values of – or even higher
than – 30bar, at least for continuous operation, multi-stage supercharging becomes necessary.
The term two-stage turbocharging describes a layout where turbochargers are connected in
series, with charge air cooling between the chargers. On the other hand, a layout with two
compressor and turbine stages each on a single shaft is termed a two-stage charger group [160]. Due
to cost reasons, such two-stage charger groups today are no longer relevant. Nevertheless, such
layouts were at one time utilized in medium-speed diesel engines. Figure6.1 shows a compact
two-stage charger group by man, Fig.6.2 shows one by Hispano-Suiza.
In general, multi-stage – today mostly done as two-stage – turbocharging has the following
advantages compared to single-stage turbocharging:
–
a signiﬁcantly higher boost pressure level, enabling the achievement of very high mean effective
pressure values;
–
an improved charging efﬁciency, even at unchanged charge pressure, since the efﬁciencies of
compressorandturbinedecreasewithanincreasingpressureratioinasinglestage.Additionally,
the total efﬁciency can be further increased with an intercooler;

Fig. 6.3. Slow-speed two-stroke engine with two-stage turbocharging [Mit-
subishi]
–
wider compressor and turbine maps, and thus improved possibilities to adapt them to the desired
engine operating range.
These advantages are opposed by some signiﬁcant disadvantages:
–
a much worse acceleration and load response behavior, since two rotors of each turbocharger
have to be accelerated with the same exhaust gas energy;
–
need for larger installation space, signiﬁcant weight increase and with it higher cost;
–
increased thermal inertia of the exhaust system, associated with a worse situation for exhaust
gas aftertreatment (catalyst light-off behavior).
Two-stage turbocharging is more suited for slow-speed two-stroke engines than for four-stroke
engines, i.e., already at a lower gain in mean effective pressure, due to the following reasons:
Weight, installed space and cost of the second charger group, including ancillaries, are less
relevant in case of a very expensive large engine.
Since the swallowing characteristic of a two-stroke engine is comparable to that of a nozzle,
its part-load behavior causes fewer problems.
Due to the need for an adequate scavenging gradient, the exhaust gas turbocharger efﬁciency
strongly inﬂuences the achievable power.
Fuel consumption, decisively important in slow-speed engines, is reduced with increasing
turbocharger efﬁciency, to a greater extend than in four-stroke engines.
For this reason, such engines are in production today. Figure6.3 shows such a slow-speed
engine by Mitsubishi.
6.2 Controlled two-stage turbocharging
The disadvantages in the response behavior of multi-stage turbocharging systems, as mentioned
above, are not only avoided, but even turned into an advantage by a two-stage charger layout ﬁrst
introduced by kkk (now 3K-Warner). Figure6.4 shows the principal layout. It utilizes a small
high-pressure charger, whose turbine can be bypassed at high exhaust gas ﬂows, via a streamlined
and low-loss waste gate. The waste gate ﬂow is also routed to the downstream low-pressure turbine
of the low-pressure charger, i.e., it is utilized.

On the one hand, this results in a very fast response behavior of the small high-pressure charger.
In addition, the complete exhaust gas energy is utilized in both turbines. At higher loads and speeds,
this leads to high boost pressures at low charge air intake temperature into the engine (charge air
cooling is possible downstream of the low-pressure and high-pressure compressors). Figures6.5
and 6.6 show some striking results which were obtained with a 12 liter truck engine.
In 2005, bmw has launched mass production of a 6-cylinder diesel engine with controlled
two-stage (partly register) turbocharging. The exhaust and charging system is designed such that
negative effects during transients are widely eliminated, resulting in very attractive transient and
steady-state boost pressure characteristics. Due to the wide speed range of this engine, a second
waste gate is installed to bypass the low-pressure turbine. The details of this engine are presented
in Sect.14.2.

6.3 Register charging
For register charging, two layouts are used, namely, single-stage and two-stage register charging.
6.3.1 Single-stage register charging
For single-stage register charging, in the lower speed range of the engine one charger (or half of
the chargers used) is switched off and the total exhaust ﬂow is routed through the other charger
(or the other half of the chargers). For example, in an engine with two chargers, because of the
increased exhaust gas energy supply, the operating turbocharger achieves signiﬁcantly higher boost
pressures than would be obtained with both chargers in operation. Thus, in the lower engine
speed range, higher mean effective pressures are achieved. Figures6.7 and 6.8 show the principles

this process and, correspondingly, smaller basic engines can be used (Fig.6.9). An example are
hydrofoils, which have demanding requirements regarding their emerge torque. This design is in
series production at mtu for their high-speed high-power engines. Such charging systems have also
been utilized repeatedly for passenger car gasoline engines. A well-known example is the 6-cylinder
engine with register charging for the Porsche model 956. The principal schematics of the layout are
shown in Fig.6.10. The implementation of register charging facilitates signiﬁcant improvements

Figure6.13 shows the results of a numeric charger layout and an analysis of the operating
strategies in the entire full-load speed range of a truck engine. Starting from a desired mean
effective pressure curve of the engine, the operating behavior of the ﬁrst and the second
charger can be tracked in the map (Fig.6.13) with thermodynamic cycle simulations. Then
the switching points can be determined, for the bleeder control of the ﬁrst charger at around
680min−1, for the connection of the second charger at around 900min−1, and the chargers can be
preselected.
6.3.2 Two-stage register charging
Typically for two-stage register charging, very compactly arranged charger groups are connected
in series in order to achieve sufﬁciently high torque output in the complete engine speed range.

pressure exhaust gas turbochargers. Figure6.15 shows the switching strategy for the charge groups
in the pressure–volume ﬂow map. Figure6.16a shows mean effective pressure values up to 30bar,
achieved with this arrangement, and Fig.6.16b shows the fuel consumption values obtained with
and without register operation.
It is obvious that the very high mean effective pressure and the excellent torque curve result
in relatively high fuel consumption due to restricted peak ﬁring pressures (retarded combustion)
and high gas exchange losses. Such engine layouts are especially suited for high-performance
ship engines. Therefore it is suited for applications where the highest power densities and engine
performances are generally needed for only short periods.
6.4 Turbo cooling and the Miller process
6.4.1 Turbo cooling
As was discussed in Chap.2, the performance of a supercharged engine can be signiﬁcantly
increased by means of charge air cooling. However, this is limited by the temperature of the coolant,
since the charge air temperature cannot fall below it. For practical and economic reasons – e.g.,
intercooler size – in most cases the charge air temperature at full load is signiﬁcantly higher than
the coolant temperature. A method to further decrease the charge air temperature – independent of
the coolant – is turbo cooling. In this case, the charge air is ﬁrst compressed above the boost level
required by the engine, then cooled in the charge air cooler, and ﬁnally its temperature is further
decreased by expansion, e.g., in an expansion turbine. Figure6.17 shows a layout in which the
expansion turbine is located on the same shaft as the turbocharger. With this layout, patented for
Daimler Benz, the charger compresses more air than the engine needs. The excess air is expanded to
ambient pressure in the cooling turbine, resulting in a temperature much lower than the temperature

114
Special processes with use of exhaust gas turbocharging
downstream of the charge air cooler CAC1, and then it is utilized in the second charge air cooler
CAC2 to further decrease the charge air temperature.
The more the pressure upstream of the cooling turbine exceeds the required boost pressure,
the greater will be the temperature decrease achievable in the cooling turbine. Thus, the success of
turbo cooling also depends on the capability – i.e., the efﬁciencies – of the exhaust gas turbocharger,
especially its turbine.
Figure6.18 shows the inﬂuence of the exhaust gas turbocharger’s efﬁciency on the achievable
power increase. It is obvious that signiﬁcant power increases can be obtained only with very high
total efﬁciencies of the charger, along with minimal improvements in fuel consumption.
In spite of the advantages mentioned above, turbo cooling is not worthwhile for series pro-
duction diesel engines today. The complexity of the turbo cooling assembly and a second charge
air cooler, in relation to the limited back-up of the boost pressure – unless two-stage compression
with even higher complexity is used – is cost-prohibitive.
Turbo cooling is more promising for gas engines. In these, the achievable power usually is not
limited by the possible degree of supercharging, but by knocking combustion. The knock limit
depends much more on the compression end temperature – and thus, at a given compression ratio,
the charge air temperature upstream of the engine – than on the degree of supercharging.
6.4.2 The Miller process
This special method of charge air cooling was originally described by Miller [103]. Contrary to
common supercharging processes, it uses very early intake valve closing times which are variable
depending on the load (Fig.6.19). In this way, the cylinder is ﬁlled with fresh air only until the
intake valve closes. During the remaining intake stroke the fresh air expands and its temperature
decreases. Compression then starts – with a smaller charge – from a lower temperature level. There-
fore, it can be termed a work process with internal cooling.
Due to the shortened effective inlet phase, the expansion stroke automatically gets longer than
the intake stroke. This can also be seen as a process with elongated expansion, as described by
Atkinson. This characterization also explains the major application for such an engine process,
i.e., cases where process temperature limitations are advantageous, or high combustion chamber
temperatures result in negative effects. For example, in slow-speed natural gas engines the
temperature-dependent knock limit represents such a limitation.

6.4 Turbo cooling and the Miller process
115
The permissible maximum pressure during combustion is one of the most important
factors limiting the mean effective pressure of a supercharged engine, unless a deterioration
of fuel economy is accepted. Exhaust emissions, which in part strongly depend on the process
temperature – especially NOx emissions –, represent an additional problem. Therefore, the Miller
process could also be used to cool an internal or external exhaust gas recirculation.
Figure6.20 shows pV diagrams of an ideal supercharged four-stroke diesel engine in regular
conﬁguration and of an engine using the Miller process. It can be seen that – if both are to utilize
the same maximum process pressure (p3cyl, p4cyl) – the Miller process requires a far higher charge
pressure p2. In order to achieve the same charge air temperature at the intake valve, the Miller
process requires more extensive charge air cooling. Then the temperature at start of compression
(p1cyl) is lower for the Miller process, and thus the temperatures remain lower throughout the
process.

Special processes with use of exhaust gas turbocharging
Figure6.21 shows the inﬂuence of "intake valve closing" timing and turbocharger total
efﬁciency on the operating data of a supercharged engine with a peak pressure value of about
150bar.
For a speciﬁed power level, the Miller process therefore requires signiﬁcantly higher boost
pressures and turbocharger total efﬁciencies than the conventional engine process of a supercharged
diesel or natural gas engine. Its application is thus limited to two circumstances:
–
the highest permissible work pressure of the process, e.g., the mechanically permissible peak
pressure given by the engine design, has been reached, but the charging system still has pressure
reserves;
–
process limitations, such as the knock limit or high NOx emissions, have been reached and
require a decrease in peak temperatures.
6.5 Turbocompound process
By deﬁnition, the net power of an engine using a compound process is generated not only in
the cylinder but also in a downstream expansion stage. In this sense, the exhaust gas turbine or
another downstream turbine provides additional power to the crankshaft in a compound engine.
The purpose of the process is to utilize the exhaust gas energy to a larger extent, resulting in better
fuel economy.
Calculations [154] show that, at the design point of the engine, improvements in fuel economy
exceeding 5% may be reached when the compressor and turbine efﬁciencies are excellent. Since
this is true especially at high engine load, the most prominent examples of turbocompound
engines are found in maritime ships which operate at constant high load for extended periods.
Therefore, reduced fuel consumption, i.e., a further increase in efﬁciency, is of the utmost
importance.
Before the gas turbine came to dominate aeronautic propulsion, aircraft piston engines
constituted another turbocompound application, because of long hours of operation at constant
high load. The conditions were especially favorable at high altitude, due to the high compression
and expansion ratios in the charger and the turbines at low ambient pressure.
The most powerful gasoline piston engine for commercial aircraft was the Curtiss-Wright
compound aircraft engine, a double-row radial engine with 18 cylinders (Fig.6.22). Its rated takeoff
powerwas2,420kWat2,900min−1.Inthisdesign,thechargerwaspoweredfromthecrankshaftata
ﬁxed ratio, which was possible without disadvantages due to the propeller load characteristic. Three
exhaust gas turbines, arranged in angular spacing of 120◦were also connected to the crankshaft at
a ﬁxed ratio, supplying power to the crankshaft.

In addition to gasoline engines, aircraft diesel engines were also produced, e.g., the 12-cylinder
two-stroke compound powertrain Nomad by Napier (Fig.6.23).
However, ﬁnally the gas turbine, the powerful and high power-density propulsion unit also used
for propeller aircraft, has relegated the piston combustion engine to use in small airplanes, where at
most a simple exhaust gas turbocharger is affordable to achieve acceptable high-altitude operation.
Two methods for exhaust gas energy utilization are employed in today’s compound engines,
i.e., recovery by conversion into either mechanical or electric energy.
6.5.1 Mechanical energy recovery
Mechanical recovery into the engine is an application for maritime ships. A fraction of the exhaust
gases is branched off upstream of the turbine of the exhaust gas turbocharger and routed to a power
turbine (Fig.6.24). At part-load, this parallel ﬂow can be switched off via valves. The power turbine
feeds its power into the engine crankshaft via a step-down gear and a hydraulic vibration-absorbing
clutch. Figure6.25 shows such a design of a slow-speed engine by abb.
Recently, the compound diesel engine with mechanical recovery has also successfully been
utilized in trucks. However, to obtain a better dynamic response during load changes, the power
turbine is arranged downstream of the exhaust gas turbocharger (Fig.6.26).

Scania has equipped its 6-cylinder engine dtc 1101 (Fig.14.53) with a compound tur-
bine. Due to this, the fuel economy was improved under actual driving conditions by 1–3%.
The general energy balance is shown in Fig.6.27 in a truck map, expressed as a percentage gain
or loss in fuel economy. As can be seen, fuel economy improvements are only possible at high
loads.
The achievable improvements in efﬁciency essentially depend on the efﬁciencies of the
turbomachinery used. To convert the exergy in the exhaust gas into power, the power turbine
slightly increases the backpressure for the exhaust gas turbocharger turbine. This causes the gas
exchange of the engine to deteriorate. The compound turbine work, which is directly dependent on

efﬁciencies, for each operating point an optimum relationship can be established between exhaust
gas turbocharger turbine and compound turbine (Fig.6.28). Such analyses have to be performed
in all relevant load points in order to ﬁnd the best layout regarding lowest fuel consumption. The
analyses can also be supported by numeric simulation of part-load sections, in which the decreasing
contribution of the compound turbine to the total power output can be determined. After adaptation
of the turbocharger and the compound turbine, the potential for fuel economy improvements in the
total load range can be determined using thermodynamic cycle simulation.
In Figs.6.29 and 6.30, the potential for fuel economy improvements is projected, by numeric
simulation, for the part-load and full-load operation of a 12 liter hsdi (high-speed direct-injection)
diesel engine with and without turbocompound application.
6.5.2 Electric energy recovery
The layout favored today for slow-speed maritime engines is the electric turbocompound system,
also called controlled compound turbine-generator layout (Fig.6.31). In this case the compound

In addition, this solution is signiﬁcantly less expensive, since the compound turbine does not
have to be linked to the engine shaft, but can be operated at constant speed as dictated by the
frequency of the ship’s electric system. Figure6.32 shows the main components of this system. Mar-
itime powertrains with compound engines today achieve total efﬁciencies signiﬁcantly above 50%.
6.6 Combined charging and special charging processes
6.6.1 Differential compound charging
Differential compound charging is only meaningful for automotive applications. The layout of the
charger group includes a power split (Fig.6.33). One power branch of the differential or planetary
gearbox feeds into the vehicle’s transmission, the second branch powers the compressor. The

torques acting on transmission and compressor are in ﬁxed relation to each other, speciﬁed by the
gear ratio. The layout is aimed at the achievement of a boost pressure curve, and thus a torque
curve, which is similar to the traction hyperbola. Around 1960, Perkins Ltd. performed tests with
such a system [53]. Substantial torque back-up was achieved, close to constant power against the
speed range (Fig.6.34). In the end, the possible reduction in gears was opposed by a signiﬁcantly
higher engine and charge system complexity. The efﬁciencies of the complete system were
signiﬁcantly below those of a comparable conventional drivetrain. Improved fuel economy, the
actual target of the research, was not achieved.

with low exhaust gas opacity and low fuel consumption. Figure6.35 shows the principal layout and
Fig.6.36 the achievable improvement in the transient boost pressure and torque responses,
compared to a conventionally turbocharged engine.
In addition, by using only the mechanical charger during engine braking, this layout can po-
tentially result in very high braking power. Due to the signiﬁcantly higher air ﬂow, the engine itself
has correspondingly higher braking power; furthermore, the required compressor work augments
the braking power.
This is especially true if the engine is equipped with a constant throttle braking system,
such as Mercedes Benz uses as standard equipment in its heavy trucks. Figure6.37 shows
the braking powers achievable with various engine braking systems. Using the system described
above, braking power values as high as the maximum net horsepower of the engine are achieved
[122].

6.6.3 Supported exhaust gas turbocharging
The desire to support the exhaust gas turbocharger in critical operating ranges via additional driving
power is long standing. In fact, supported exhaust gas turbocharging is the logical and further
integrated advancement of mechanical auxiliary supercharging. The goals are identical. In general,
supported exhaust gas turbocharging aims at additional power supply to the charger. Several drive
systems, including switchable systems, are under intensive development. Two examples of systems
actually produced have to be mentioned: an exhaust gas turbocharger with hydraulic support drive
(Fig.6.38 shows the hydraulic support turbine located on the rotor assembly) and systems with

electric support drive. Similar to the hydraulic support turbine, the rotor of the electric support
motor is also located on the turbocharger shaft (Fig.6.39).
With such support drives, the air supply to the engine in the lowest speed range and during
transient operation can be signiﬁcantly improved. Since the enthalpy ﬂow of the exhaust gas is
also increased at the turbine, performance ratios (in reference to the energy supplied to the support
drive) signiﬁcantly above 1 (up to 1.4) are achieved. Accordingly, with such systems both goals
can be reached, i.e., signiﬁcant increases of the stationary engine mean effective pressures at low
speeds (Fig.6.40), and faster transient boost pressure buildup (Fig.6.41) [159].
6.6.4 Comprex pressure-wave charging process
The disadvantages of the exhaust gas turbocharger regarding its acceleration behavior and torque
buildup have been mentioned several times. They gave ample reason to look for ways to utilize the
exhaust gas energy for boost pressure generation which avoid these deﬁciencies. One of these is
to transfer the pressure energy in the exhaust in a gasdynamic process directly to the charge air.

Fig. 6.42. Diagram of a pressure-wave charger [37]
Such a charger, called Comprex, was developed to series production by Brown-Boveri. The
mode of action in a pressure-wave charger is based on the reﬂection behavior of pressure waves in
a pipe. A positive or negative pressure wave running in a pipe will be changed into its opposite at
an open end of a pipe, but will be ampliﬁed to double its amplitude at a closed end of a pipe.
In practice, the pressure-wave charger (Fig.6.42) consists of a cell rotor with open channels
arranged frontally at its perimeter. To control the process, the cell rotor has to be powered, but
requires only as much power as needed to override bearing and ventilation losses. On the one side
of the cell rotor the low-pressure and the high-pressure (or charge-pressure) fresh air ports are
arranged frontally; on the opposite side the identical low-pressure and high-pressure exhaust gas
ports are located. The compression energy for the charge air is extracted from the exhaust gas.
The processes in the cell rotor itself can best be understood by examining the unwound cell rotor
perimeter (Fig.6.43), where the intake and outlet ports of the ﬁxed housing are also shown.
The cycle starts at 1 in Fig.6.43. At this point, all cells are supposed to be ﬁlled with fresh air
under ambient pressure (intake state p0). The vertical bars indicate that at this point the gas is at rest.
The exhaust gases of the engine are collected in an exhaust plenum (A) and then ﬂow towards the
cell intake (HPE) at even and constant pressure. If now – due to the rotation of the cell rotor – a cell
ﬁlled with air under ambient pressure is connected to the high-pressure port, the higher-pressure
exhaust gas enters the cell and triggers a pressure wave in that cell which propagates at sonic speed
and compresses the cell air, accelerating it towards the charge air high-pressure port (HPA).
The pressure wave must reach the opposite end of the cell rotor at that instant at which – due
to the rotation of the cell rotor – the charge air port (HPA) is opened. Thus, the compressed air
can ﬂow into the charge air plenum (B) and from there to the engine. The cell reaches the closing
edge of the high-pressure port at a time when it is ﬁlled with exhaust gas for about two thirds of its
length, thereby preventing further entry of high-pressure exhaust gas. At this point, the cell channel
is ﬁlled with a mixture of about 2/3 exhaust gas and 1/3 air, at a pressure which is lower than the
exhaust gas pressure in HPE, but higher than in HPA. On its way to the low-pressure port system
the exhaust gas–air mixture in the cell comes to rest (2).
As soon as the cell – in its further rotation – passes the edge of the low-pressure exhaust port,
the exhaust gas–air mixture can leave the cell in the direction of the gas housing, triggering a
low-pressure wave which propagates into the cell. At optimum cell rotor speed, this low-pressure –

and thus suction – wave reaches the opposite cell end just at the instant in which the low-pressure
air channel is opened. Now the cell is again ﬁlled with air from the intake system, while the exhaust
gas continues to ﬂow towards the outlet. When exhaust gas and mixed gas have left the cell, i.e.,
the cell is completely scavenged, the process starts again.
From this description it is obvious that the process can provide satisfactory charge pressures
and efﬁciencies only if it is exactly controlled (the problems with the practical application of
pressure-wave charging were formerly control related). Obviously, the process strongly depends
on the sonic speed, and thus on the exhaust gas and air temperatures, but not on any load or speed
conditions of the engine. However, since the cell rotor drive had to be linked in some form to the
engine and thus to the engine speed, complicated additional gasdynamic processes were necessary
to optimally adapt the process to the engine conditions. Also, the pressure-wave process is very
sensitive with regard to the exhaust gas backpressure in the exhaust system.
Present research on pressure-wave chargers has eliminated the ﬁxed ratio connection to the
engine, but uses a small electric motor to power the cell rotor, since the required drive power is
insigniﬁcant (Fig.6.44). The speed of the electric motor-cell rotor group is controlled dependent
on the exhaust gas temperature. Similar to the turbocharging systems with various additional drives
discussed in Sect.6.6.3, the Comprex charger achieves considerable increases in boost pressure in
the lowest speed range, i.e., at small absolute mass or volume ﬂows (Fig.6.45).

Whether or not the pressure-wave charger will make a comeback, will depend on the results
of this development. In the meantime, the vtg exhaust gas turbocharger is used by practically all
manufacturers of supercharged diesel engines. Results from a pressure-wave charged passenger
car diesel engine will be discussed in Sect.14.2.
6.6.5 Hyperbar charging process
To achieve an exhaust gas turbocharger and thus engine response as fast as possible (to meet
especially high requirements for torque, i.e., boost pressure buildup), a combustion chamber can
be added upstream of the turbine. With the injection of the fuel, the enthalpy supply to the
turbine can be signiﬁcantly increased instantaneously. Such a layout (Fig.6.46) is termed the

Hyperbar charging process [100]. However, the faster response of the charging system has to be
paid off by a deterioration in the total efﬁciency of the system due to the afterburner process. The
fuel consumption is increased so dramatically that the process was never introduced into series
production.
6.6.6 Design of combined supercharging processes via thermodynamic
cycle simulations
Two-stroke engine with combined supercharging
In contrast to four-stroke engines, two-stroke engines cannot force the gas exchange via piston
movement, since the exhaust and intake strokes of the piston are absent. Accordingly, in a two-
stroke engine the exhaust gas has to be expelled and the fresh gas inducted with the help of an
external scavenging pump.
In order to achieve a desired torque curve in a two-stroke engine it is important to match the
gas exchange and the charging system of the engine, especially in the lowest full-load speed range.
There, the low gas cycle scavenging efﬁciency demands relatively high air delivery ratios and
thus mass ﬂows. Therefore, for a two-stroke automotive engine the design point of a mechanical
scavenging or supercharging compressor must be in that speed range.
In addition, for the two-stroke engine, turbocharging is an indispensable method to increase
its power density. If the efﬁciencies of the turbocharger are high enough such that a positive
pressure gradient is maintained between intake and exhaust manifolds, a scavenging pump becomes
unnecessary. For this, the total efﬁciencies of the charger have to surpass approximately 55%, which
are common values for slow-speed two-stroke maritime diesel engines.
Besides the requirements of the scavenging process and the supercharging system, also
sufﬁcient cooling of the combustion chamber – especially the exhaust valve(s) – must be considered
particularly for medium- and slow-speed two-stroke engines. This can be achieved by late closing
of the valve. A signiﬁcant fraction of the induced fresh gas mass is scavenged through the engine
in this way (scavenging efﬁciency of only 0.6–0.7) and the components are very effectively cooled
by the passing charge air.
Additionally – with regard to the scavenging and supercharging systems for slow-speed
engines – due to the high turbocharger efﬁciencies, mechanically driven compressors are usually
only utilized at part-load (or during engine startup), unless electrically driven turbochargers are
available. Here, charge air cooling is also indispensable to obtain the best efﬁciencies and to meet
maximum durability requirements.
On the other hand, the efﬁciencies of turbochargers for small passenger car engines are much
lower. Therefore, the small two-stroke engine always needs a scavenging pump in addition to the
turbocharger. The pump assures the necessary scavenging pressure gradient between the fresh gas
and exhaust gas sides. In general, such a layout is called a combined charging and scavenging
system.
Various layouts are possible for such combined scavenging and charging systems:
1. turbocharger upstream of scavenging pump without charge air cooling
2. turbocharger downstream of scavenging pump without charge air cooling
3. options 1 and 2 with charge air cooling directly upstream of the engine
4. options 1 and 2 with charge air cooling between the two compressors
5. options 1 and 2 with charge air cooling between the two compressors and directly upstream
of the engine.
130
Special processes with use of exhaust gas turbocharging
Options 1 and 2, without charge air cooling, have minimum design complexity, but – as mentioned
above – also minimum power density. They will hardly be used in the future. If charge air cooling
is used directly upstream of the engine (option 3), the speciﬁc power and the torque of the engine
can be increased, both by increasing the charge air density (up to 40%) and by reducing the thermal
load. Additionally, NOx emissions are reduced, making charge air cooling practically indispensable
for achieving low engine-out emission levels.
The advantage of option 4 is the lower required drive power for the second compressor. The
charge air cooler located downstream of the ﬁrst compressor lowers the inlet temperature into the
second compressor by up to 100K (depending on the pressure ratio). This reduces the drive power
for the second compressor by up to 25%. Consequently, the speciﬁc fuel economy of the engine is
also improved. Option 5 combines the advantages of the other options, but adds the disadvantages
of high design complexity and very high system costs.
The design of the scavenging and charging systems must be carried out under consideration
of the layout of gas exchange timing. Usually, this is done with the help of thermodynamic
cycle simulations. Design criteria are the scavenging pressure and, especially, the exhaust
backpressure, i.e., a sufﬁcient scavenging pressure gradient. Low scavenging gradients require
relatively elongated opening periods for the gas exchange control devices (ports or valves). These,
however, result in a deterioration of the fresh gas scavenging efﬁciency at low speeds. Therefore,
as a ﬁrst step the inﬂuence of port or valve timing has to be analyzed, and then the timing has to
be selected according to the desired torque characteristic (Fig.6.47).

Once the timing is selected, the scavenging compressor and the turbocharger can be
dimensioned. Both ﬁxed-geometry chargers and vtg chargers may be used. By closing the inlet
guide blades of a vtg, it is possible to signiﬁcantly increase the ﬂow resistance of the turbine
especially in the lower speed range. This reduces the scavenging losses and signiﬁcantly improves

the vtg is shown in Fig.6.48 for a full-load low-speed operating point of a 3-cylinder passenger
car two-stroke diesel engine, as obtained by numeric cycle simulations (avl-boost).
Four-stroke engine with combined supercharging
For four-stroke engines as well, low end torque requirements are a very important design criterion
for the supercharging system. The minimum turbine swallowing capacity is the criterion for the
dimensioning of turbines with ﬁxed as well as with variable geometry. When comparing various
chargers, the boost pressure and thus the mean effective pressure buildup in the lowest speed
range, and the engine full-load fuel consumption at high speeds, can be simulated and evaluated
(Fig.6.49).
Combined supercharging of four-stroke engines offers additional possibilities for increasing the
mean effective pressures at low engine speeds. In this case it is advantageous for the turbocharger
compressor to be supported by the mechanical charger, thus less turbine power is necessary. In this
way, larger turbines can be applied, which signiﬁcantly improve, on the one hand, the engine’s fuel
economy, especially at high speeds, and on the other hand, the speed range of the engine.
The layout of such complex supercharging systems can always be supported by numeric
simulations. These are also used to determine the gear ratios for mechanical chargers (Fig.6.50).
7 Performance characteristics of supercharged
engines
7.1 Load response and acceleration behavior
The air ﬂow through the engine is nearly independent of the load and strictly determined by the
engine speed in a naturally aspirated diesel engine. With this characteristic it exhibits the best
possible load response behavior. Its power and torque increase only depend on the rate of increase
in the amount of fuel injected – if injection timing and combustion efﬁciency are considered
nearly constant and the speed change is small in comparison to the change in the amount of fuel
injected.
The exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine represents the opposite, i.e., the worst case.
In gasoline engines with external mixture formation, load is controlled by mixture quantity,
which is controlled by throttling the amount of mixture aspirated. Therefore, at low load, low
pressures (down to 0.5bar) occur in the complete manifold system downstream of the throttle,
and the speed of the turbocharger drops signiﬁcantly due to the low amount of exhaust gas
supplied.
The entire process used to achieve full load, i.e., full torque, as fast as possible in this engine
is very complex and especially time-consuming. By opening the throttle, the pressure in the intake
system downstream of it has to be raised to ambient pressure, and in parallel the amount of fuel
injected has to be increased.
In the course of this process, the amount of exhaust gas and its temperature also rise, increasing
the turbine power of the exhaust gas turbocharger. The charger’s rotating assembly is accelerated
and the boost pressure increased. After that, the process accelerates progressively, since the turbine
power increases faster then the required compressor power. As can be seen, the complete process
cannot occur in a very short period of time.
Figure7.1 shows an example. From an initial vehicle velocity of 40km/h, i.e., low part load,
full load is applied. First, the intake manifold is ﬁlled to ambient pressure. This process takes about
0.2s – the same would be the case in a naturally aspirated gasoline engine. In the case of the exhaust
gasturbochargedengine,subsequentlytheexponentialboostpressurebuildupjustdescribedoccurs,
in this extreme case taking another 5s.
For the same vehicle, Fig.7.2 shows a transient engine acceleration from an initial operating
point which approximately corresponds to ambient pressure in the intake manifold. It can be seen
that, without ﬁrst having to ﬁll the intake system and with a higher baseline exhaust gas energy, the
boost pressure buildup occurs much faster, i.e., in about 0.6s.
Engines with mechanically powered and ﬁxed coupled chargers react like naturally aspirated
diesel engines; if a clutch between charger and engine is included in the layout, the pressure buildup
also depends on the clutch characteristic.

7.2 Torque behavior and torque curve
For any turbocharged engine, the achievable torque depends on the state of the charge air, i.e.,
its pressure and temperature, and on the excess air required for the actual combustion process.
Against speed, engine torque is therefore determined by the charger characteristic. In an exhaust
gas turbocharged engine, an equilibrium is reached between turbine power supply and compressor
power need, increased by the charger’s power loss.
These relationships were described in Sect.2.6 for stationary processes. According to this,
mechanically supercharged engines have maps as, e.g., shown in Fig.7.3. For exhaust gas
turbocharged engines the pressure–volume ﬂow maps are valid as summarized in Fig.7.4,
depending on the mode of operation. Figure7.4a shows the map of an uncontrolled exhaust gas
turbocharger of a truck diesel engine with a limited speed range. The map of an exhaust gas
turbocharged passenger car diesel engine is plotted in Fig.7.4b, followed by Fig.7.4c with the
wide map of an exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine, the last two both with waste gate. Due
to the thermodynamic coupling to each individual engine type, a pressure equilibrium is reached,
which results in far better boost pressure curves against engine speed than a turbo compressor
could achieve with ﬁxed speed coupling.
Thus, the torque curve of exhaust gas turbocharged and mechanically supercharged diesel
engines is primarily deﬁned by the given fuel injection quantities against speed. For the gasoline
engine, with its approximately constant air-to-fuel ratio against load and speed, the torque curve
is determined by the boost pressure curve (see Sect.8.6.2).

7.3 High-altitude behavior of supercharged engines
Looking at their behavior at high altitude, distinctions have to be made between mechani-
cally supercharged and turbocharged engines. As described in detail in Chap.4, both displace-
ment and turbo compressors can be utilized for mechanically driven chargers with ﬁxed speed
ratio.
As is generally known, turbo compressors are characterized by their nearly constant pressure
ratios (depending on speed) between surge limit and choke limit. At high-altitude operation, and at
unchanged speed, such a charger will maintain the pressure ratio and deliver the volume ﬂow which
can be aspirated by the engine. However, due to the reduced ambient pressure at high altitude, the
boost pressure decreases (at unchanged charger speed) and the engine power is reduced by the
same degree as it would be reduced in a naturally aspirated engine.
Contrary to the turbo compressor and in accordance with their speed characteristic curves,
displacement compressors supply nearly any pressure ratio at a given speed. But, due to the lower
136
Performance characteristics of supercharged engines
ambient density of the intake air at high altitude, the mass pumped per volume unit is reduced and
thus also the achievable engine power.
In summary:
–
The displacement compressor supplies a constant volume ﬂow through the engine, and therefore
can also generate higher pressure ratios. At high altitude, however, it would have to aspirate
more volume, i.e., to be operated at a higher speed, in order to maintain the engine power
independent of altitude.
–
The turbo compressor can supply nearly any required volume ﬂow – independent of speed –
but for the higher pressure ratios desired at high altitude its speed would have to be increased
correspondingly.
For the exhaust gas turbocharger, which is coupled to the engine only thermodynamically, the
situation is different.
At ﬁrst, with increasing altitude and thus decreasing ambient pressure the utilizable turbine
expansion ratio T increases, due to a decrease in p4. All other data assumed constant, this leads
to an increase in turbine power and thus automatically to an increase in compressor power which,
naturally, can only be transformed into an increased compressor air ﬂow at increased pressure ratio.
This results in a nearly full compensation for the reduced air density at the intake of the charge air
into the engine.

Therefore, the power of an exhaust gas turbocharged engine is more or less independent of the
altitude – at least as long as the compressor and turbine efﬁciencies stay about constant and the com-
pressor and turbine maps show sufﬁcient ﬂow reserves.
For an exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine, Fig.7.5 shows the changes which occur in the
charger map at an altitude of 2,500m. The volume capacity increases by about the same amount as
the density decreases, and the same increase is seen for the resulting pressure ratio. It can also be
seen that at this altitude the speed limits of the charger are reached.
Nowadays, for truck and passenger car diesel engines, high-altitude compensation is
implemented up to about 2,500m. At higher altitudes, torque and power are reduced – by injecting
less fuel in such a way that the exhaust temperature remains approximately constant – to avoid
excessive speeds of the charger. In the exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine, in which the boost
pressure has to be controlled in any case, speciﬁed absolute boost pressure levels are maintained
through the control of the required fuel quantity. Here too, the exhaust gas temperature is the
decisive parameter.
While for naturally aspirated and, as discussed earlier, mechanically supercharged engines,
according to the decrease of the air density, which reaches about 9% per 1,000m, the engine output
decreases at the same percentage, the exhaust gas turbocharged engine is able to compensate this
change in ambient conditions.
For these changes in ambient conditions, Table7.1 provides some guiding lines regarding the
change of important operating parameters in exhaust gas turbocharged four-stroke diesel engines
(at constant fuel injection quantity).
7.4 Stationary and slow-speed engines
The transient behavior of the exhaust gas turbocharging system is also of importance for stationary
and slow-speed engines. Here, sudden load changes also occur, by load addition or changes in
operating status. As mentioned, each change in the boost pressure of the exhaust gas turbocharger
is necessarily linked to a change in speed. Thus, in these engines signiﬁcant accelerations occur
very frequently as well, from low idle (lowest permissible engine speed) to peak torque at medium
speed or even to rated power, i.e., highest torque at rated speed. To achieve this, the exhaust gas
138
Performance characteristics of supercharged engines
turbocharger has to be accelerated to higher speeds via an increased exhaust gas quantity as well
as a correspondingly increasing exhaust gas temperature. Here, air delivery lags behind the power
requirement.
The acceleration behavior of various exhaust gas turbocharger designs is the ﬁrst parameter
to be analyzed. This can be done by either applying a reference value developed by Zinner [160,
161], or by numeric simulation of the transient behavior (see Sect.7.5).
At a sudden increase in power demand, the exhaust gas turbocharger lag will be the larger
the higher the degree of supercharging is chosen. For example, if the mean effective pressure of
a turbocharged four-stroke diesel engine is 20bar, and assuming that such an engine in naturally
aspirated conﬁguration could reach about 9bar, the power deﬁcit at a sudden load increase is 11bar.
In this case, and this applies to all quality-controlled engines, it is not possible to immediately
release the full-load injection quantity, but it has to be adjusted to the instantaneously available
boost pressure.
This used to be done with a so-called charge-pressure-dependent full-load stop. Today, with
electronically controlled injection pumps, the boost pressure status of the engine is continuously
monitored and the injection amount is adjusted to the actual boost pressure. At the same time, for
improved charger acceleration, the air-to-fuel ratio λ is electronically controlled down to a tolerable
minimum. In any case, depending on engine size and design, it takes some time until full load is
obtained.
7.4.1 Generator operation
For slow-speed engines, load increase in generator operation represents a critical situation.
Figure7.6 shows how the electric and engine data react if a load is suddenly applied to the generator.
Although, due to the inertia of the system, the current requirement I can be met immediately, the
full recovery of engine and charger speed takes about 6s. Improvements can be achieved especially
by a reduction of the charger inertia – i.e., possibly a layout with several chargers with smaller
rotors instead of one large charger – as well as increases in the compressor and turbine efﬁciencies.

Fig. 7.7. Comparison of load response for pulse and
constant-pressure turbocharging [159]
AsFig.7.7shows,foranenginewithquasi-constant-pressureturbocharginganda3-pulseturbo-
charging system, the layout of the charger group itself can signiﬁcantly contribute to an improved
load response. The speed undershoot is signiﬁcantly minimized at pulse turbocharging –
duration of about 5s and speed decrease of about 8% – compared with that at constant-pressure
turbocharging – duration of about 9s and speed decrease of 15%.
7.4.2 Operation in propeller mode
The acceleration capability of the powertrain is also very important for propeller operation. Here
the load is predetermined by the power-consumption capability of the ship or aircraft propeller. In
addition, during transient operation of the system, speciﬁc standards for both noise and pollutant
emissions must also be met.
For a medium-speed, highly supercharged four-stroke diesel engine with a power of about
4,000kW, Fig.7.8 shows an acceleration process, with a comparison of pulse turbocharging and
constant-pressure turbocharging. Starting from idle at 135min−1, the time was measured to reach
full-load mean effective pressure of 16bar at 400min−1 by releasing the fuel injection quantity
permissible at any given time. The advantage of utilizing gasdynamic processes in exhaust gas
turbocharging is apparent.
As a second example, an acceleration process is shown in Fig.7.9 for a slow-speed two-stroke
engine that is directly connected to a ship propeller. The engine is equipped with constant-pressure
turbocharging, and its piston bottoms are utilized as additional mechanical air pumps. At low loads,
the additional air is directly routed to the charger via injectors. At higher loads, it is routed parallel
to the exhaust gas turbocharger, directly into the charge air manifold. With constant-pressure
turbocharging, at part load the turbine can generate only very little energy. Therefore, without the

additional piston bottom pumps, the positive scavenging gradient necessary for scavenging could
not be maintained. The injection of the additional air into the charger is also necessary to prevent
compressor surging.
It can be concluded that the acceleration process is relatively slow, on the one hand, due to
the large masses of the exhaust gas turbochargers, with compressor diameter of 760mm, on the
other, due to the very low turbine excess power of constant-pressure turbocharging systems (also
see Sect.7.4.3).
7.4.3 Acceleration supports
The acceleration support methods discussed here are especially suited for slow-speed engines.
They are only meant to support acceleration and for adjustments when sudden load changes are
required. They can be classiﬁed as follows:
–
acceleration support necessary only at start and under sudden load increases from idle (rare
utilization);
–
acceleration support frequently needed which justiﬁes certain additional design complexity
(Sect.7.4.4).
For the ﬁrst group, preferably additional compressors, either externally powered or driven by the
engine, or alternatively the addition of pressurized air from a tank can be considered. However, the
additional air quantity acts differently for two-stroke and for four-stroke engines.
The pressure–volume ﬂow map of a two-stroke engine is shown in Fig.7.10. Here, at low
loads an additional air mass, b2, causes a push back of the air mass a1, supplied by the exhaust
gas turbocharger, into the surge area of the compressor. At high loads, this additional air mass is

tolerated. A1 is left of the surge limit. Therefore, in a two-stroke engine the induction of additional
air – for the optimum acceleration of the exhaust gas turbocharger at the low end – has to be done
via injection into the compressor (Fig.7.9). Only at high loads, direct injection upstream of the
engine is feasible.
For a four-stroke engine, the conditions are exactly opposite (Fig.7.11). In the idle range,
additional air induction is accepted by the turbocharger compressor. At high loads, its induction
would force the compressor into the surge range (A2 is left of the surge limit). Therefore, in a
four-stroke engine the additional air must be added directly into the charge air manifold, only in
the lower speed and load range.
7.4.4 Special problems of turbocharging two-stroke engines
For two-stroke engines it is especially important that acceleration support systems, with their
increased design complexity, be constantly available. Depending on the actual layout, their exhaust
gas turbocharger may not provide the necessary positive scavenging gradient (the boost pressure
must be higher than the pressure upstream of the turbine) for all operating conditions. In order to
solve this problem, a ﬁrst possible method is the addition of a mechanically powered compressor
in series with the compressor of the turbocharger. At low exhaust energy, i.e., insufﬁcient scavenge
pressure by the turbocharger, the mechanical compressor takes over. With increasing engine power,
the exhaust gas turbocharger’s fraction of the compression work increases, while that of the
mechanical compressor decreases. An example of this setup in an automotive engine is described
in Sect.6.6.6.
An especially elegant but complex solution is powering the exhaust gas turbocharger from the
engine crankshaft via a transmission and a freewheel clutch (Fig.7.12). General Motors used this
solution in their two-stroke locomotive engines emd 567 and 645. At low engine power, when
the exhaust gas energy is not sufﬁcient, the shaft of the exhaust gas turbocharger is powered by
the engine. With increasing engine power the exhaust gas turbocharger covers an ever increasing
fraction of the compressor power. Once the compressor power is completely supplied by the exhaust
gas turbocharger, the mechanical connection is disengaged by the freewheel clutch.
In slow-speed two-stroke engines, e.g., man models ksz and kez (Fig.7B), an electrically
powered auxiliary supercharger is utilized which automatically engages or disengages at a speciﬁc
load point. With this layout, the use of the piston bottoms as auxiliary pumps can be avoided. As an

alternative, Siemens has developed an electric motor directly coupled to an exhaust gas turbocharger
shaft. Governed by power electronics, it is engaged at startup and part-load operation. Under all
other conditions it runs, without using power, without being disconnected.
The described systems offer possibilities for transient performance improvements to be utilized
in future, modern engine designs with the most sophisticated charger technology. This especially
since new emission standards in marine port areas may very soon require additional steps to reduce
exhaust emissions at low loads. More information on this follows in Chap.13.

7.5 Transient operation of a four-stroke ship engine with register charging
Not only for on-road vehicles but also for other applications the transient operating behavior of
supercharged engines is of substantial importance in meeting operational requirements. A high-
power ship powertrain and its dynamic operating behavior are discussed here as an example
[55]. The complete system (Fig.7.14) consists of the combustion engine and four two-stage reg-
ister charging groups. Additionally, water-cooled charge air coolers are arranged between the com-
pressor stages of each group. For transient operating processes, the individual register groups can
now be connected with the exhaust gas manifold via corresponding control elements.
Figures7.15 and 7.16 summarize the control strategy for the engagement and disengagement
of the various register groups, the resulting response of the engine, and the acceleration and de-
celeration of the ship. It has to be mentioned that such a rapid acceleration and deceleration of the
engine is only possible in interaction with a variable-pitch propeller.
8 Operating behavior of supercharged engines
in automotive applications
The term “automotive” covers not only on-road vehicles but also off-road vehicles, tractors, and,
e.g., locomotives. Here we ﬁrst will only differentiate between passenger car and truck re-
quirements. Off-road and tractor concerns can be treated as a subgroup of truck requirements.
And requirements for locomotives largely correspond to those of stationary engine operating
conditions. The special requirements of the latter vehicle categories will be discussed in
Sect.8.3.
For the application of a supercharged reciprocating piston combustion engine in a vehicle, it
is totally insufﬁcient to simply increase its speciﬁc power and torque. Far more criteria have to be
met, as Table8.1 tries to characterize even if it is certainly not exhaustive.
Therefore, we have to analyze what requirements today’s engine designs pose on a super-
charging system and to what extent the supercharging systems described here can meet these
requirements.
In this context, the term “engine” is actually too limited. What’s more, the criteria listed have
to be met in various vehicle categories, e.g., passenger cars or trucks. Depending on the use, the
criteria have to be weighted quite differently or, if need be, must be augmented. Then they can
be summarized in a list of speciﬁcations for new engine concepts and can be checked against
their anticipated use. In relation to the supercharging system, such requirement speciﬁcations are
explained in the following sections.
8.1 Requirements for use in passenger vehicles
Already now, but even more so in the future, passenger cars require quite high driving performances.
These are linked to equally high requirements regarding their driving and operating comfort, i.e.,
harmonic power curve and buildup, wide drivable speed range, high engine elasticity, and excellent
smoothness of operation.

8.2 Requirements for use in trucks
145
In addition, high economy must be achieved at low acquisition and lifecycle costs and at
extremely low fuel consumption, which is one of the main reasons for supercharged passenger car
engines.
Achievement of exhaust emission standards, with some safety margins, is naturally a prerequi-
site. These standards will certainly become even more stringent in the future. On the basis of the
scenarios brieﬂy discussed above, the – again strongly abbreviated – requirements for a super-
charging system can be summarized as follows:
–
a wide capacity range of the compressor, due to the wide speed range of passenger car engines;
–
an only limited torque increase from the lowest full-load speed, to achieve a controllable
starting and drive-off behavior;
–
a relatively ﬂat torque curve, to achieve acceptable drivability via the gas pedal, independent
of the engine speed;
–
low cost of the supercharging system.
8.2 Requirements for use in trucks
Trucks are used for quite more purposes than passenger cars – from delivery trucks to long-haul
18-wheelers. Here we will concentrate on the long-haul scenario. In this application, the maximum
speeds permissible have to be maintained wherever possible, which requires high excess engine
power and high braking power. In addition, the lowest possible fuel consumption values must be
realized. This is economically of the utmost importance – for a long-haul truck, fuel cost represents
up to 30% of the operating costs. Furthermore, it must be possible to start – fully loaded – on an
incline, which poses high demands on the torque curve and torque response. Further indispensable
requirements are low initial cost, durability, long maintenance intervals, and high reliability.
Thus,differentrequirementsapplyregardingtheapplicationofsuperchargingsystemsintrucks:
–
A narrow capacity range of the charger, due to the narrow power speed range of truck engines;
–
high to very high attainable pressure ratios, from 3.5 to 4.5, which approach the strength
limit of today’s aluminum cast radial compressors, due to the high degree of supercharging
required and the signiﬁcant torque back-up desired, up to 30%;
–
a durability of the supercharging system that is compatible with the durability of the engine,
nowadays at least 0.6 to 1 millionkm.

Operating behavior of supercharged engines in automotive applications
Plotting these requirements in a pressure–volume ﬂow map, which is the relevant diagram to
characterize superchargers, for passenger car applications a wide and ﬂat map and for truck
applications a narrow and high map are obtained (Fig.8.1).
8.3 Other automotive applications
In addition to the requirements listed above for truck engines, engines for agricultural applications
must meet the following requirements with regard to their supercharging system: Large torque
increase at falling engine speeds all the way down to the lowest full-load speed, in order to avoid
engine stall at load peaks (e.g., when plowing).
If this is not feasible, engines with higher rated power have to be utilized, whose normal load
response can deal with such load peaks.
For locomotive applications, a distinction has to be made between diesel-hydraulic and diesel-
electric powertrains.
For the diesel-hydraulic powertrain, largely the same requirements as for truck engines apply,
especially the need for a torque increase at lower speeds. Here this is necessary to approach the
traction hyperbola in the individual transmission gears as closely as possible.
In contrast, the diesel-electric powertrain is mostly operated along the load curve, and therefore
the criteria established for stationary engines apply.
Depending on the design of a ship, to some extent very diverse requirements apply for maritime
applications. For example, under normal operating conditions, at least the additional acceleration
power for engine, powertrain, and propeller must be generated, while for hydrofoils additionally
the emerge resistance has to be accommodated.
8.4 Transient response of the exhaust gas turbocharged engine
What do the requirements mentioned above mean for an exhaust gas turbocharging system? For
turbocharged automotive engines, the problems with load response, described in Sect. 7.4.1 and
more closely speciﬁed above for automotive applications, are especially inconvenient, because they
can interfere with the operator’s desire to control the power and torque of his vehicle by means of
the gas pedal. This is especially true in critical starting situations.
But also under other (perhaps even critical) driving situations, the driver of a road vehicle
depends on the predictability of his powertrain. An example is a passing maneuver. For such a
situation, naturally aspirated or mechanically supercharged engines are best suited. This is one
reason why passenger cars with gasoline engines today are predominantly equipped with naturally
aspirated engines.
Further, in some engine designs, e.g., the supercharged gasoline engine, the boost pressure has
to be limited to avoid knocking combustion.
As a consequence of the above statements, for supercharged automotive engines, or any other
supercharged engines with predominant transient operation, the boost pressure buildup and the
control of the boost pressure are of major importance. This applies especially for the time needed
to increase the boost pressure when the load is increased.
To take a closer look at this problem, comparative load response tests were performed utilizing
a very fast-reacting Comprex pressure-wave charger (Sect.6.5.4) and a ﬁxed-geometry exhaust gas
turbocharger equipped with waste gate. Figure8.2 shows the typical differences in boost pressure
buildup when the load is increased, once from low part-load (exhaust gas temperature of 150 ◦C),
8.4 Transient response of the exhaust gas turbocharged engine
147
and once from medium part-load (exhaust gas temperature of 450 ◦C). As can be seen, with buildup
times of about 0.5s the pressure-wave charger shows excellent results.
Following up on these results, load change response tests were performed for typical truck and
passenger car application patterns. Both bench tests and road tests with the corresponding vehicles
were performed. The resulting driving impressions were characterized and discussed on the basis
of the boost pressure buildup characteristics.
8.4.1 Passenger car application
The power and torque curves of a passenger car diesel engine, equipped once with a pressure-wave
charger and once with an exhaust gas turbocharger, are shown in Fig.8.3. The engines have the
same power output, and – at least under steady-state conditions – the pressure-wave charger does
not have a signiﬁcantly different torque curve.
Figure8.4 shows the results of transient acceleration in ﬁrst and fourth gear on a test bench. Here
signiﬁcant differences in load response can be observed. While it takes the exhaust gas turbocharg-
er about 3s for full boost pressure buildup, the fast pressure-wave charger can perform this in
about 1s.

The impact of this on the driving performance of a passenger car is very signiﬁcant as plotted
in Fig.8.5. It shows the starting and acceleration behavior of a vehicle, equipped with both engine
variants and a 4-speed automatic transmission. Again, in the case of the pressure-wave charger
the boost pressure buildup occurs within 1s. This results in a harmonious power increase and
accordingly harmonious speed increase with approximately constant acceleration. Since this is
what the driver expects, it is rated as good driving behavior.
When the vehicle is equipped with the exhaust gas turbocharged engine, the full boost pressure
buildup does not only take about 3s but also is nonlinear. This results in a signiﬁcant dip in
speed increase and acceleration which the driver neither expects nor accepts. It is obvious that the
pressure buildup characteristics of the supercharging system play a decisive role in an application
in a passenger car. In short, for passenger car applications of supercharging systems the following
rule applies:
In passenger cars, supercharging systems with boost pressure buildup times signiﬁcantly
larger than 1s result in a nearly unacceptable load buildup behavior.
It is therefore imperative to reduce the boost pressure buildup times of the exhaust gas
turbocharger by suitable measures.

Fig. 8.7. Load response bench test of the engines shown in Fig. 8.6, with pressure-wave charger (dash line); with exhaust

test is summarized in Fig.8.7. While the pressure-wave charger can quickly build up its full boost
pressure – i.e., the boost pressure resulting at a given engine speed under steady-state conditions –
in about 1s, the exhaust gas turbocharger takes about 4s for this task. This is an immense
difference.
Figure8.8 shows a starting process, at an incline and with full payload, with both engine
conﬁgurations in identical vehicles. As can be seen, due to the large mass of the truck the seemingly
sluggish boost pressure buildup of the exhaust gas turbocharged engine is practically unnoticeable
in the two lower gears. In contrast, the bad driveability in the third gear becomes very obvious –
caused by the exhaust gas turbocharged engine’s lack of torque at low speeds.
With this, the following conclusions can be drawn with regard to the exhaust gas turbocharged
truck engine:
–
high torque at low speeds is very important to assure power continuity on upshifts;
–
in comparison to a good torque curve, the load response time of the exhaust gas turbocharger
is not very critical for driving performance;
–
for the starting process itself, fast boost pressure increase is only necessary if the basic torque
of the engine, i.e., its naturally aspirated torque, is not sufﬁcient for starting under difﬁcult
conditions.
Of course, for a complete engine assessment, these summarized conclusions have to be augmented
by additional criteria, e.g., pollutant emissions, lowest possible fuel consumption, noticeable power
dip of turbocharged engines while shifting, and engine braking behavior.

8.5 Exhaust gas turbocharger layout for automotive application
8.5.1 Steady-state layout
Engine exhaust gas temperatures change with changing engine speed. This represents a layout
problem for the automotive application of turbochargers since it means that the turbine has to
process larger and highly ﬂuctuating volume ﬂows in comparison to the compressor. Turbines with
ﬁxed geometry are limited in their capability to do this (Fig.8.9), i.e., to provide for volume ﬂow
ratios of 3:1 and also for similar full-load speed ratios. This can easily be recognized by the fact
that the turbine pressure ratio exceeds the compressor pressure ratio. Figure8.10 shows an actual
exhaust gas turbocharger compressor map of a ﬁxed-geometry charger, into which – corrected for
the different volume ﬂow – the correspondingly occurring turbine pressure and turbine pressure
ratio curves are also plotted.
For this reason, so-called relief (blowoff) or waste gate control is often utilized for engines
with a wider speed range, i.e., passenger car and small truck engines.
Waste gate control describes an arrangement in which a valve is located in the exhaust manifold
upstream of the turbine. Whenever required, a certain exhaust gas quantity can be routed by the

valve directly into the low-pressure exhaust system, bypassing the turbine. This leads to a reduction
in turbine volume ﬂow. However, compared to a turbine designed for rated power, for the remaining
exhaust gas this has the disadvantage of a higher turbine inlet pressure, with which the turbine still
has to generate the power required to drive the compressor. A principle diagram of a compressor
and turbine map with possible layout strategies for the turbine is sketched in Fig.8.11.
Figure8.12 shows a sketch of the principle and Fig.8.13 an actual compressor and turbine
map of an exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine equipped with a waste gate turbocharger. It
is obvious that the boost pressure has to be reduced with increasing volume ﬂow, i.e., power, to
avoid negative pressure gradients between charge air and exhaust gas ﬂow.
Considering the facts discussed up to now, it can be concluded that typically a ﬁxed-geometry
turbine can be effectively matched to an engine – provided it is for minor volume ﬂow ranges of
about 3:1, i.e., for truck applications. For volume ﬂow ratios above 4:1, even with waste gate
control, either high boost pressure cannot be realized in the low-speed range or the turbine cannot
handle the ﬂow rates at high engine speeds (i.e., due to volume ﬂow and turbine inlet pressure
reasons, p3 becomes intolerably high). This is even more so if the boost pressure has to be limited –
which for turbocharged passenger car engines is always the case due to powertrain stress or
combustion problems (knocking combustion in gasoline engines).
It was therefore necessary to look for an effective solution which on the one hand increases the
exhaust gas turbine power at low exhaust gas ﬂows and low exhaust gas temperatures. On the other
hand it should generate the required turbine power at high engine speeds, preferably utilizing the
total exhaust gas mass and with the lowest possible exhaust gas turbine inlet pressure. A solution
already in series production for some time is a variable turbine geometry (vtg).
In an exhaust gas turbocharger with variable turbine geometry the ﬁxed-geometry turbine
housing is replaced by one with adjustable blades. With this, the conditions for ﬂow entry into the

turbine can be varied to a large extent. As a result, such an exhaust gas turbocharger can already
generate high boost pressures at low full-load speeds. Further, at high volume ﬂows the required
turbine power can be achieved with comparatively good efﬁciency, i.e., low exhaust gas turbine
inlet pressures. This is shown in Fig.8.14 in comparison with a waste gate charger.
Nowadays, nearly all passenger car diesel engines are using a vtg turbocharger in series
production. The ﬁrst truck engines with vtg are also in series production and more will soon
follow. Figure8.15 shows an actual compressor and turbine map of a small truck engine. Boost
pressure and exhaust gas turbine inlet pressure are tuned for minimum fuel consumption at full load.

state operating conditions has been examined. However, for many applications mostly transient
operating conditions dominate the load histories.

As was discussed as an empirical test result in Sect. 8.4, besides generating the rated boost
pressure, this also addresses the time needed to build up the pressure when sudden load increases
occur. In addition, the effects on the driving behavior which have been established in tests must be
analyzed. To do this, let us examine the diagrams in Fig.8.16.
Figure8.16a shows the compressor power (thick line) required for the desired boost pressure
curve, plotted against the mass ﬂow, which itself is approximately proportional to the engine speed.

Operating behavior of supercharged engines in automotive applications
Additionally, the power curves for two extreme turbine layouts are shown.
The right-hand limiting curve describes a turbine layout which can achieve the required com-
pressor power only at maximum air ﬂow, i.e., rated engine power (see its intersection with the
power curve of the compressor). The left-hand limiting curve represents a turbine layout which, at
maximum blowoff quantity along the choke limit of the turbine, would be barely able to generate
the maximum compressor power.
As can be seen, even this smallest turbine with waste gate cannot generate the compressor
drive power required for the desired boost pressure at lowest engine speeds, i.e., the engine can be
operated only with less torque than desired. The power deﬁcit is shown in light grey. On the other
hand, it can be seen that sufﬁcient excess power at the turbine, necessary for acceleration of the
charger, is achieved only at relatively high mass ﬂows. In addition, the diagram shows the turbine
excess power requirements, necessary for speciﬁc turbocharger speed acceleration values and thus
pressure buildup time spans.
The value Pacc,1, plotted in Fig.8.16a, represents the acceleration power required for boost
pressure buildup in 1s. Transferred to Fig.8.16b, this results in the ﬂow range in which this rapid
boost pressure change can be realized. In our example, this would be possible from about half of
total air ﬂow, i.e., from about half of rated engine speed.
Examining the situation for an exhaust gas turbocharger with variable turbine geometry in the
same diagram setup (Fig.8.17), it becomes obvious that the conditions are signiﬁcantly improved,
both for the generation of sufﬁcient boost pressure at low engine speed and for the excess power
required for rapid boost pressure buildup.
Figure8.18 shows acceleration bench tests comparing a ﬁxed-geometry exhaust gas turbo-
charger, a pressure-wave charger (known for its rapid response and here taken as benchmark), and
a vtg exhaust gas turbocharger, utilizing the same passenger car diesel engine and for accelerations
in ﬁrst and fourth gear. As can be seen, at pressure buildup time spans of about 1s in both gears, the
vtg charger can reduce the corresponding values of the ﬁxed-geometry turbocharger by about 2/3.

Extended driving tests lead to the conclusion that pressure buildup times of about 1s are
considered pleasant by normal drivers. Therefore, a torque buildup time of 1s must be aimed at.
With the exception of the starting phase, this target value can be reached by using a vtg charger.
Thus, the transient layout criteria can be summarized as follows:
–
If mostly transient conditions are of major relevance, both for truck and passenger car appli-
cations the layout of an exhaust gas turbocharger leads to certain problems. However, these
problems differ in trucks and cars:
In truck applications, due to the high degree of supercharging utilized today, which result in
pressure ratios of C = 3.5–4.5, the turbine and compressor map is narrow.
In passenger car applications, due to the wide speed range of modern engines, the full utilization
of the turbine and compressor maps becomes problematical.
–
In addition, the turbine layout, with or without waste gate, must accommodate these
requirements:
at maximum speed a sufﬁcient distance has to be maintained from the choke limit of the turbine;
an adequate speed reserve for high-altitude operation has to be provided;
at low engine speeds a boost pressure as high as possible has to be achieved.
–
As a ﬁnal basic requirement, the turbine must be able to provide sufﬁcient acceleration power
for short pressure buildup times.
Naturally, waste gate and vtg chargers are most successful in meeting all these requirements.

8.5.3 Numerical simulation of the operating behavior of the engine
in interaction with the total vehicle system
The support of the preliminary layout of supercharged engines by numerical simulations is not
limited to the charger layout and control itself, but – by using suitable methods – can be expanded
to include the complete powertrain. Appropriate program systems enable the modeling of the
complete vehicle (gpa [125], cruise [35]), or the required simulation models can be created via
methods such as matlab-simulink.
An example for complete system modeling with the simulation tool avl-cruise is shown
in Fig.8.19. Here, a passenger car powertrain with a 2.5 liter di-diesel engine is modeled.
Such complete system models have to be veriﬁed by comparison with measurement data. Since
these methods are preferentially used for the assessment of complete concepts (e.g., regard-
ing their fuel consumption and emissions values in a driving cycle), the comparison between
simulation and measurement data has to include not only the thermodynamic conditions but also
the bench test emission values. Table8.2 shows such a comparison for the mentioned vehicle.
8.6 Gasoline and natural gas engines

8.6 Special problems of supercharged gasoline and natural gas engines
8.6.1 Knocking combustion
In a gasoline engine, knocking combustion may occur according to the following process. At full
load, after normal ignition at the spark plug, the combustion propagates at a high pressure level and
even increases further. Thus, the unburned mixture located ahead of the ﬂame front is compressed
isentropically. Its temperature is increased and it either self-ignites or ignition is caused by a “hot
spot” in the combustion chamber. The mixture fraction which has until then remained unburned
now combusts extremely rapidly, similar to a detonation. This causes pressure vibrations in the
combustion chamber which are in some cases very violent. Such detonation waves are characterized
by very high heat transmission coefﬁcients. This leads to mechanical and thermal damage of
the engine. Therefore, knocking combustion has to be avoided by all means. It thus limits the
supercharging capability of gasoline engines.
In an examination of knocking combustion, the following main parameters have to be
considered:
mixture condition (λ, cylinder charge)
compression ratio
ignition timing
combustion chamber geometry
For supercharged engines, the ﬁrst three parameters are of special importance since they strongly
inﬂuence the process via pressure and temperature upstream of the turbine. Their impact was
analyzed utilizing an exhaust gas turbocharged 2.8 liter engine at an especially knock-critical
speed.
The mixture condition in the cylinder of a spark-ignited engine is deﬁned by the parameters
compression end temperature T2cyl, compression end pressure p2cyl, the relative air-to-fuel ratio
λ, the amount of residual gas in the cylinder, and the fuel octane number. These parameters,
systematically varied, lead to the relationships shown in Fig.8.20.
Here, the boost pressure p′
2 possible at the knock limit is plotted against the mixture temperature
T ′
2 upstream of the intake valve, for the two air-to-fuel ratios of λ = 0.9 and λ = 1.1 and for two
fuel octane numbers, RON = 91 (regular gasoline) and RON = 100 (premium gasoline). The strong
inﬂuences of both octane number and charge air temperature can be clearly seen.
We would normally anticipate that the compression ratio ε would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the tendency towards knocking due to its effect on the compression end pressure and temperature.
However, in tests where ε was reduced from 8:1 to 6:1 the knock tendency did not decrease as much
as expected. A rough estimation of the compression end temperature according to the equation
T2cyl = T1cylεκ−1 ∼= T2εκ−1
(8.1)
shows that a signiﬁcant decrease in the compression end temperature and, thus, the knock tendency
could theoretically be expected.
It becomes obvious that when the amount of residual gas is taken into account, the compression
end temperature decreases much less with decreasing compression ratio ε than when residual gas
is not taken into account. This is caused by the relative increase in the amount of residual gas
at reduced compression ratio (increase in combustion chamber volume), which results in higher
charge temperatures.

Fig. 8.21. Boost pressures achievable at knock limit, depending on octane number and charge air intake temperature,
against compression ratio ε (for an exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine)
For the same test engine, the boost pressures achievable at the knock limit, depending on octane
number and charge air intake temperature are shown in Fig.8.21 as a function of the compression
ratio ε. As can be seen, due to the relationships discussed above, a reduction in the compression ratio
onlyallowssmallboostpressureincreasesiftheengineisnotequippedwithchargeaircooling.With
the application of an efﬁcient charge air cooler, however, the inﬂuence of the compression ratio on
theachievableboostpressuresigniﬁcantlyincreases.ThiscanbeseenintheuppercurveinFig.8.21.
Regarding its inﬂuence both on combustion knock and the efﬁciency of the high-pressure cycle,
ignition timing is a signiﬁcant factor. Figure8.22 shows the inﬂuence of ignition timing on the
achievable mean effective pressure, depending on the boost pressure and both with and without
charge air cooling.
Even at a very low compression ratio of 8:1, the best ignition timing can be selected only up
to a boost pressure of 1.4bar. Due to the knock limit, higher boost pressures can only be realized
with retarded ignition timing. Here too the dominant inﬂuence of charge air cooling can be seen.
Together with the intake port and valve geometry, the shape of the combustion chamber of a
modern gasoline engine has to assure that sufﬁcient mixture motion is achieved. To avoid knocking
combustion, intensive mixture motion is especially effective. On the one hand, it mixes and thus
cools down the residual gas mixture fractions, on the other hand, it increases the ﬂame velocity.
Nowadays, by designing the intake ports accordingly, a “tumble” is created in the combustion
chamber.
Besides selecting the optimum combustion chamber shape, it is also necessary to assure
sufﬁcient and targeted cooling of the valves and walls of the combustion chamber. This will avoid
any hot spots in the chamber where the mixture could prematurely ignite or at least could heat up
signiﬁcantly.

The four-valve technology of today’s gasoline engines offers the best boundary conditions
for supercharging since it enables a signiﬁcantly better cooling of the hot exhaust valves due to
increased valve seat and valve shaft areas, especially if the given potential for cooling has been
fully exhausted and is augmented by piston cooling. In this context, further advanced research and
development is necessary.
8.6.2 Problems of quantity control
As is generally known, the gasoline engine can only be operated within a relatively narrow range of
the air-to-fuel ratio λ; with the 3-way catalyst – which is nowadays indispensable – only at λ = 1.
Therefore, load control cannot be attained in the same way as in the diesel engine, i.e., by only
changing the amount of fuel at constant air ﬂow (quality control), but it has to be done via changing
the amount of mixture at constant λ ≈1 (quantity control).
Accordingly,amappingofswallowingcurvesagainstenginespeed,asischaracteristicfordiesel
engines, is not applicable for supercharged gasoline engines. As Fig.7.4 shows in comparison to
diesel engines with and without waste gate, the boost pressure in the intake manifold downstream
of the throttle is kept at the desired pressure level, as long as possible, by the boost pressure control
device. The reduction in the aspirated mixture mass – due to a load reduction – is achieved by
closing the throttle located between the turbocharger and cylinder.
Only when the boost pressure cannot be maintained any longer due to lacking turbine power,
the characteristic curve in the compressor map drops down. As can be seen in the map, for different
engine speeds this occurs at different times. This leads to diesel-like operating curves, which,
however, only reﬂect the different air ﬂows necessary to overcome the power losses at the various
engine speeds.
Admittedly, these remarks are only valid if the throttle is located downstream of the charger.
The layout with the throttle upstream of the compressor will be discussed in Sect. 9.2.2.
Therefore, boost pressure control is of much greater importance for the supercharged gasoline
engine than for the diesel engine. Naturally, this is especially valid for the exhaust gas turbocharged
gasoline engine.

philosophies for ﬁxed-geometry and VTG
chargers
First the most important deﬁnitions regarding control processes should be given. They are deﬁned
by the German Industry Standard DIN 19226.
–
Open-loop control: One or several input parameters inﬂuence one or several output parameters
in a system, based on regularities which are relevant to the system and are either measured or
predeﬁned.
–
Closed-loop control: The parameters being controlled are constantly measured. The result is
compared with the reference variables and then the parameters are adjusted correspondingly.
Each control loop contains at least one series connection of controller (governor) and control path.
In a control loop, a distinction has to be made between command response and disturbance response.
–
Command response is the reaction of the controlled parameter in the control loop to a change
in the command (target) value.
–
Disturbance response is characterized by the reaction of the controlled parameter to a change
in the disturbance variable.
9.1 Basic problems of exhaust gas turbocharger control
The exhaust gas turbocharger is only thermodynamically coupled to the engine. This is an inherent
advantage, but also a problem of turbocharger systems. Once the compressor and turbine have
been selected, a speciﬁc boost pressure curve results in the entire speed range of the engine,
dependent on the load only. The curve corresponds to the turbocharger main equation (equilibrium
between turbine power and the sum of compressor power and friction losses).
Therefore, the boost pressure can only be controlled via the control of compressor or turbine
power, as was discussed in Sect. 8.5.
At an airﬂow rate given or required by the engine, the compressor power can be controlled
either by changes in the compressor efﬁciency or by changes in the air quantity, e.g., by means of
a compressor bypass.
Several possibilities exist for controlling the turbine power:
–
change of turbine volume ﬂow by means of an exhaust gas waste gate;
–
change of turbine inlet ﬂow conditions by means of variable turbine intake geometry, i.e., the
vtg turbine;
9.2 Fixed-geometry exhaust gas turbochargers
163
–
change of engine parameters which inﬂuence the combustion efﬁciency, e.g., varying the air-
to-fuel ratio or the combustion process (heat release) and thus the exhaust gas temperature.
In order to utilize these possibilities for a targeted and meaningful change in charger behavior
and of the pressure and volume ﬂows provided by the exhaust gas turbocharger, a control system
is necessary. If transient engine operation is of special relevance, the need for control of the
turbocharger intensiﬁes. For the adaptation of all modern exhaust gas turbocharger systems it is
therefore also necessary to know the possible or acceptable control systems and philosophies.
9.2 Fixed-geometry exhaust gas turbochargers
Control measures possible for exhaust gas turbochargers with ﬁxed turbine inlet geometry will
be discussed ﬁrst. This covers both turbine volute housings for radial turbines and corresponding
intake housings for axial turbines.
9.2.1 Control interaction possibilities for stationary operating conditions
All the possibilities mentioned are effective for turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines operating
under steady-state conditions. They are: relief (or blowoff) valve at air intake side, exhaust gas
waste gate, bypass valve at air intake side.
Air blowoff via a relief valve represents the simplest way to obtain a speciﬁed boost pressure.
For today’s mixture formation and engine control systems, which measure the amount of intake
air, this design is not suitable. It is ineffective since engine power is wasted due to an unnecessary
high exhaust gas turbine inlet pressure. Figure9.1 shows a possible simple layout.
If the boost pressure is to be controlled dependent on load conditions, e.g., in a gasoline engine,
this valve can be utilized for this task by connecting the intake manifold pressure to the spring
chamber (see Fig.9.2).
For exhaust gas waste gate control, a bypass with a valve is installed which allows to route a
part of the gas ﬂow around the turbine. Provided that the desired boost pressure is lower than the
pressure achievable with fully closed waste gate, its power and thus the desired boost pressure for
a speciﬁed load point can be adjusted by control of the amount of exhaust gas ﬂowing through the
turbine. Further, a waste gate layout has the ability to extend the virtual volume ﬂow range of the
turbine – by circumventing it.

However, it has the disadvantage that – in order to be able to achieve sufﬁcient turbine power –
the reduced amount of exhaust gas actually ﬂowing through the turbine must have a higher turbine
inlet pressure.
The waste gate, which is a blowoff valve, may be arranged separately in the exhaust manifold
upstream of the turbine (Fig.9.3). However, nowadays it is generally designed as a disc valve and
integrated into the turbine housing. Figure9.4 shows an example of the gas ﬂow through the turbine
and the waste gate, as designed by 3K-Warner. This valve is either controlled by the boost pressure

itself or – preferably – controlled electronically in accordance with a predetermined boost pressure
target value.
If the spring chamber (Fig.9.3) is also subjected to the boost pressure, the basic module for a
very simple boost pressure control system is created (see Sect.9.2.2).
Inﬂuencing compressor power by changing efﬁciency and air ﬂow via a bypass valve on the
intake side is frequently utilized in slow-speed engines. In these highly turbocharged engines, this
control system can assure a sufﬁcient distance between engine operating curve and surge limit, and

it can shift the engine operation line into a range with improved compressor efﬁciencies. Figure9.5
shows the principal layout of such an engine, including power, mass ﬂow, pressure, and temperature
data at 50% load, with and without bypass. Figure9.6a shows the changes in volume ﬂow in the
compressor map, and Fig.9.6b shows the corresponding advantages and disadvantages at part-load.
9.2.2 Transient control strategies
For steady-state engine operation, boost pressure control is necessary for power and torque
adjustment. As we have seen in Chap.8, for transient engine operation, control of the transient
behavior of exhaust gas turbocharged engines is absolutely necessary in order to achieve an
acceptable load response. Partially, the control modules already described can be used for this
task. However, and this will be discussed in more detail later, the control measures and strategies
are changing.
General control options for turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines
Here, those possibilities will be discussed which can be applied independent of the type of the
basic engine.
The waste gate described previously, which circumvents the turbine, can be utilized not only
to control the boost pressure but also to improve the transient behavior of diesel engines. In doing
so, the selected turbine must be as small as possible, accepting certain efﬁciency losses. This
results in higher available turbine power and thus shorter charger speed buildup times in the lower
engine speed range. Figure9.7 shows this for an exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine. The
disadvantage is the unavoidable increase in fuel consumption at high engine speeds.
Control options for turbocharged gasoline engines
In gasoline engines, the control options mentioned above assure knock-free combustion and
compliance with the map limits of both compressors and turbines, by specifying a maximum
possible or desired boost pressure value in predeﬁned maps. In exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline
engines, additional controls can improve the transient behavior further. Due to quantity control via
the throttle, even at part load high boost pressures are generated and only the mixture mass ﬂow is
adjusted to the load.

Fig. 9.8. Compressor bypass valve [kkk, now 3K-
Warner]
The simplest measure is a bypass valve (Fig.9.8), which serves several functions. On the one
hand, by providing a virtual increase in compressor volume ﬂow it allows a higher boost pressure at
the surge limit. Thus, when the load is increased, a priori a higher charge pressure is available. On
the other hand, it is absolutely necessary if the throttle is arranged downstream of the compressor.
If this throttle is closed instantaneously during engine operation at higher load and speed, the air
ﬂow through the engine becomes negligible, but due to the inertia of the rotor assembly the exhaust
gas turbine still provides excess power, at least for a short time. This would result in very high
boost pressures at very low mass ﬂow rates, i.e., operation of the compressor in the surge range.
To avoid this, the spring-loaded bypass valve (Fig.9.8) opens – when the predetermined
differential pressure between compressor outlet and intake manifold downstream of the throttle
is reached and routes air back to the compressor intake. This reduces the boost pressure and
again results in a virtual increase of the compressor volume ﬂow, which prevents surging of the
compressor.
A very effective measure to improve the load response is the arrangement of the throttle
upstream of the compressor. Due to the quantity control of the engine described above, a
corresponding amount of exhaust gas energy (and thus the same turbine power) is always available
at part load, determined by exhaust gas mass and pressure.
The control of the mixture mass required for the actual part-load point is always obtained
by throttling. This may be done upstream or downstream of the compressor. The compressor
always delivers a certain volume ﬂow, while the engine requires a particular mixture quantity.
According to the equation
V = m/ρ,
(9.1)
the volume of this mixture quantity depends on its density. Therefore, considering the state of the
air, e.g., at compressor outlet, the actual mass ﬂow corresponding to the volume delivered by the
compressor can be determined. Figure9.9 schematically shows the layout of throttles upstream and

and downstream (dash line) of the compressor and
the resulting pressure conditions in the intake system
downstream of the compressor, and the resulting pressure traces in the intake manifolds. In both
cases, ambient pressure p0 prevails at the air ﬁlter. At low loads, this pressure is higher than the
pressure p2 in the intake manifold upstream of the engine. In case of a downstream arrangement of
the throttle, the compressor aspirates the air at ambient pressure. Then the air is compressed to an
interim pressure p∗
2 downstream of the compressor, from where it is throttled to the required intake
manifold pressure p2.
In Fig.9.10, corresponding typical operating points are plotted in a compressor map for bmep
values of 2.4 and 6bar at points A1–A3.
If the throttle is arranged upstream of the compressor, air is throttled from p0 to an interim
pressure p∗
1 which is lower than the pressure p2 in the charge air manifold (Fig.9.9). Here the
air has less density and a correspondingly larger speciﬁc volume (points B1–B3 in Fig.9.10) at
which it ﬂows into the compressor and is then compressed from p∗
1 to p2. As Fig.9.10 clearly
shows, this occurs at better efﬁciencies, far away from the surge limit, and at higher compressor
speeds. Therefore, it provides better takeoff conditions for sudden load increases. Figure9.11
shows the differences between the two control strategies – throttle upstream or downstream of the
compressor – at various loads, as well as the resulting compressor speeds, against engine speed.
Compressor speed increases of up to 10,000min−1 are achieved.
However, the discussed layout of the throttle upstream of the compressor is associated with
two problems.
–
For operation at inlet pressures signiﬁcantly below ambient conditions, it requires a charger
designed with an effective depression compressor housing oil seal. Even today this represents
a challenging task and, of special signiﬁcance, results in additional cost.
–
If a charge air cooler with its pipes is added downstream of the compressor, the charge air
system volume increases dramatically. This volume has to be drained at part load and ﬁlled
at load increases, deteriorating the load response of the engine.
For steady-state natural gas engines, the layout with the throttle upstream of the compressor is state
of the art today, since it allows the induction of the gas upstream of the compressor, which results
in a very well homogenized mixture.

9.2.3 Part-load and emission control parameters and control strategies
Gasoline and natural gas engines
It is necessary to ensure that the full-load boost pressure limit is not exceeded. In an exhaust gas
turbocharged gasoline engine with the control throttle located downstream of the compressor, the
pressure upstream of the throttle must not increase too much at part load. The throttle controls the
engine load exactly by throttling the boost pressure.
If the boost pressure and, thus, the pressure ratio at small mass ﬂows is too high, the operating
point drifts into the instable range of the charger map, to the left of the surge limit. This can be
avoided by using the pressure upstream of the throttle as control pressure in the waste gate actuator,
as shown in Fig.9.12.
As long as sufﬁcient turbine power is available, this control system limits the boost pressure
upstream of the throttle to a constant maximum or predetermined value – also at part load. The
advantage of this layout is the constant pressure upstream of the throttle with its good load response
at sudden load increases. This results in engine operating characteristic curves as shown in Fig.9.13.
However, part-load fuel consumption is increased due to the high turbine power required for the
load-independent supply of the full boost pressure.
Therefore, it may make sense to utilize the pressure downstream of the throttle – in a gasoline
engine a direct indication for the load – as control variable. This leads to the layout with a part-load
waste gate sketched in Fig.9.14.
Pressures higher than desired and even unstable pressures can thus be avoided. However, the
load response suffers somewhat, since the waste gate also opens at part load. By reducing the
part-load compressor power, the fuel consumption is also reduced. Figure9.15 shows the layout as
well as the pressure sensors for the part-load blowoff control, and also the schematic layout of the
electronic pressure control in the upper chamber of the waste gate via pressure pulse valves (pulse
width modulation valves).
This allows an engine operation with a constant pressure gradient at the throttle, which may
be advantageous for the control system. In order to achieve a buildup of boost pressure as fast and
precisely as possible, and an exact control of the load-determining boost pressure at part load, it
is worthwhile to combine all the measures discussed up to now in a waste gate boost pressure

boost pressure upstream of the throttle until the desired boost pressure downstream of the throttle –
i.e., the load-determining boost pressure value – is achieved. This arrangement avoids a creeping
opening of the valve at small differences between target and actual boost pressure, which would
be associated with the disadvantage of exhaust gas pressure losses. The waste gate is fully closed.

On the other hand, with such a layout any desired value below the maximum possible boost
pressure (waste gate fully closed) can be reached. This is also used to control the air-to-fuel ratio
at part load of modern diesel engines. In gasoline engines it is used for load control in the entire
boost pressure operating range.
However, this requires a suitable control layout, as described in Sect. 9.3.6.
Diesel engines
Besides full-load control, a supercharged diesel engine also needs control at part-load operation.
On the one hand, this is aimed at reducing its exhaust emissions, on the other, at improving its
load-response out of part load.
For example, the part-load boost pressure can be optimized for minimum emissions of one
or several exhaust gas components. Then these values are entered into a map, which subsequently
is used to control the waste gate for optimal boost pressure. Obviously, only a reduction of the
maximum pressure achievable without activation of the waste gate is possible. To improve the
9.3 Exhaust gas turbocharger with variable turbine geometry
173
boost pressure buildup and thus the load response of the engine under these operating conditions,
the full closing of the waste gate, already described, must in any case also be possible.
The turbine size of a turbocharger with a waste gate is also a very important factor contributing
to reduced emissions. The choice of a rather small turbine, associated with high waste gate gas ﬂow
rates, offers the possibility of generating a high exhaust gas turbine inlet pressure. This can be used
for exhaust gas recirculation, which needs a driving pressure gradient between exhaust system and
charge air manifold. As was the case with part-load boost pressure control, this measure may be
associated with a – possibly substantial – increase in fuel consumption.
Special control interventions for engine braking
For engine braking, all ﬁxed and waste gate charger systems must be equipped with an exhaust
brake throttle downstream of the turbine. During engine braking, this causes high pressures in the
exhaust system and an associated, essentially undesirable, reopening of the exhaust valves. It also
creates high pressures in the turbine housing, with all the associated problems for the proper sealing
of the charger bearings.
9.3 Exhaust gas turbocharger with variable turbine geometry
9.3.1 General control possibilities and strategies for chargers
In a charger with variable turbine geometry (vtg), the boost pressure can be easily changed during
operation and thus controlled. This is achieved by adjusting the inlet blades of the turbine, i.e., by
changing the gas entry angle into the rotor. Figure9.16 shows such a charger. The advantage of the
vtg charger is that the total exhaust gas quantity can always be utilized for power generation in
the turbine. This has a very positive impact on turbine efﬁciencies since it signiﬁcantly widens the
usable ﬂow rate range of the turbine (Fig.9.17). The necessary exhaust gas turbine inlet pressure,
particularly in comparison with waste gate control, is signiﬁcantly reduced. In order to fully utilize
this advantage, the position of the turbine inlet blades has to be controlled on the basis of suitable
control parameters.
9.3.2 Control strategies for improved steady-state operation
Since gasoline engines with vtg chargers are not yet in mass production, the following remarks
refer to engine quality control of the diesel engine. With vtg, for any engine operating point the

quantity and pressure of the charge air can be widely varied by changing the turbine inlet area, i.e.,
by changing the turbine power.
By choosing a particular angular position for the inlet blades, described here as relative blade
position, that airﬂow rate can be chosen which, e.g., offers lowest fuel consumption. As shown
in Fig.9.18, a deviation from the optimum setting results in increased fuel consumption. This is
caused by the following reasons: At greater relative blade positions – which in this context means
a larger turbine area – the delivered air mass and thus the air-to-fuel ratio λ decrease, resulting in a

slower combustion process, the combustion duration is extended and the wall heat losses increase.
Evidence of this is an increased emission of particulate matter.
At smaller relative blade positions, i.e., at decreased turbine areas, the gas exchange losses,
due to negative scavenging pressure gradients, will be increased. The air ﬂow rate and thus blade
angle resulting in the lowest fuel consumption is that which leads to the best compromise between
air-to-fuel ratio and scavenging pressure gradient.
9.3.3 Control strategies for improved transient operation
Ingeneral,thetwocriteriamentionedabovearealsoapplicableundertransientoperatingconditions.
In early controller layouts as sketched in Fig.9.19, simple pi controllers were used to control p′
2
in such a way that at a load change the new, higher boost pressure is achieved as fast as possible.
Such controllers showed unsatisfactory results when tested under transient conditions (Fig.9.20).
Figure9.20b shows the boost pressure curves for a ﬁxed geometry charger and a vtg charger with
p2s control. With the vtg charger, the boost pressure increases much faster than with the ﬁxed
geometry charger.
However, as plotted in Fig.9.20a this can result in a totally unacceptable characteristic of the
increase in engine torque, which lags for about 2s far below even that of the ﬁxed-geometry charger.
The reason for this can be seen in Fig.9.20c. When adjusting for the most rapid boost pressure
increase, the turbine area is reduced to its predetermined minimum. As a result, the turbine
inlet pressure signiﬁcantly increases, which leads to high negative gas exchange mean effective
pressures. These have to be compensated by the engine, resulting in a loss of torque available at
the ﬂywheel. Therefore, at a load increase, it is not sufﬁcient only to adjust the turbine inlet blades
to their minimum position until the desired boost pressure is achieved. Rather, it is important that
in the process of adjustment to a new boost pressure value, at sudden load increases certain limits
(Fig.9.21) are not exceeded.
As shown in Fig.9.21, a load increase can be subdivided into four phases. Starting from a steady-
state part-load condition (1), e.g., 20% of full-load, the demanded load is increased instantaneously
to 100% (shown in Fig.9.21 by the accelerator pedal travel, i.e., load requirement, curve). In this
phase (2), the vtg is closed to a speciﬁed minimum area (Fig.9.21a). At the same time, it is
important that the air-to-fuel ratio λ does not fall under a speciﬁed limit, primarily determined by
the exhaust gas opacity value. In addition, a too large negative gas exchange scavenging pressure
gradient(p′
2 −p3)cannotbetolerated,atleastnotforalongerperiod.Thisiscontrolledbyreopening
the vtg in phase 3, although the desired boost pressure may not yet have been obtained.
The full boost pressure, λ, and the scavenging pressure gradient approach their ﬁnal values
only in phase 4. Numeric cycle simulations are also an excellent tool for the development of

solid line, vtg with map-based pilot control
However, currently it is not yet possible to measure these parameters directly with sensors of
sufﬁcient durability and low cost. A possible solution is to expand the pi controller, which was
mentioned before, via load- and speed-dependent maps for the integral and proportional fractions
to be selected, combined with a vtg actuator with pilot control (Fig.9.22). With this improved
vtg controller, satisfactory pressure and speed buildup times can be obtained. Figure9.23 shows
this for a full-load application at low engine speed, and Fig.9.24 at high engine speed.
A further improvement is possible for vehicle applications, especially for trucks. During gear
shifts, due to insufﬁcient exhaust gas mass ﬂow the ﬁxed-geometry charger signiﬁcantly drops
in speed, and thus the boost pressure. If at that point the vtg inlet guide blades are closed, the
speed drop, and boost pressure loss, is signiﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the air-to-fuel ratio λ
which occurs when load is reapplied after the gear shift is improved. This is important for transient
exhaust emission tests. Figure9.25 shows the effect of such a gearshift vtg control, resulting in a
signiﬁcantly reduced boost pressure drop during the shift, an improved load response after the shift,
and thus improved vehicle acceleration. Further details regarding controller layout will follow in
Sect.9.3.6.
9.3.4 Special control strategies for increased engine braking performance
Due to advancements in supercharging technology, desired power and torque values can be realized
with ever decreasing engine displacements. When such modern high-power engines are utilized

in trucks, an additional problem arises: The small-displacement engine has to generate higher
speciﬁc braking power. Further, such higher engine braking power is required at relatively low
engine speeds, in order to enable braking for adjustment of the vehicle speed to the trafﬁc ﬂow
without gear shift down. vtg technology can offer solutions to this problem, provided the following
conditions are met:
–
Even when the vtg area is small, it still must assure sufﬁciently high turbine efﬁciencies.
–
These small turbine inlet areas must be controlled accurately and with smallest hysteresis.
The vtg must be able to mechanically withstand the resulting high exhaust gas turbine inlet
pressures (including the sealing of the turbine and bearing housings).
During braking, very high pressure ratios occur at smallest turbine areas (Fig.9.26), since
only in this way the turbine power necessary for high air ﬂows during engine braking can be
provided.

The higher air ﬂow rates which can be achieved in this way during engine braking result in
a signiﬁcant increase in the braking performance (Fig.9.27), as desired, even at a lower thermal
engine load, due to lower exhaust gas temperatures.
9.3.5 Special problems of supercharged gasoline and natural gas engines
Additional problems arise if vtg charger technology is applied to gasoline engines. On the one
hand, the high exhaust temperatures during full-load and during part-load operation, and on the
other hand, the signiﬁcantly increased demands on control accuracy and speed, caused by the
gasoline engine’s quantity control are critical. The complete control strategy for an exhaust gas
turbocharged gasoline engine poses high demands on the layout and architecture of an electronic
control system, due to
–
throttling at low load,
–
controlled exhaust gas recirculation in the lower- and medium-load range,
–
the need for precise load control by controlling the boost pressure in the higher-load range
(otherwise high gas exchange losses would occur, resulting in increased fuel consumption),
–
cold-start and warmup problems in connection with the necessary λ control and the control of
the catalyst temperature.
9.3.6 Schematic layout of electronic waste gate and VTG control systems
In general, of course we have to distinguish between the diesel engine’s quality control and the
gasoline engine’s quantity control.
Gasoline engines
The controller architecture becomes very complex for exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engines.
However, due to ever improving simulation tools supporting the controller layout (Sect.9.3.7),
no unsolvable difﬁculties remain. Figure9.15 shows a principal diagram of an electronic control
system for an exhaust gas turbocharged gasoline engine with waste gate charger. Here, for an engine
equipped with two turbochargers, the full boost pressure upstream of the throttles is measured and
fed into the control unit as an input variable. Additionally, this measured signal is routed to a
pulse valve assembly which generates a control pressure via pulse width modulation valves for
two-directional ﬂows.
This control pressure is measured and controlled by the control unit via pulse timing in such
a way that a force equilibrium is achieved in the waste gate control assembly (e.g., a membrane
pressurized on both sides and under spring pretension), resulting in the waste gate position which
corresponds to the desired boost pressure p2.
Diesel engines
The advantages of vtg chargers described above – e.g., widely adjustable boost pressure, better
load control in case of gasoline engines, mutual tolerance adjustment of charger and engine – can
only be utilized in combination with a powerful electronic control system. Here, in any operating
point the actuator must be able to set the turbine inlet blades to any position. The characteristics
of the actuator and the control loop are decisive for the dynamics of boost pressure buildup and
the control performance.
Since the system and thus the system characteristics depend only on the exhaust gas ﬂow, a
non-linear control path results for the actuation of the inlet blades.
180
Charger control intervention
Additionally, other limiting relations inﬂuence the control system and thus may result in
control oscillations. These limitations include the air-to-fuel ratio λ, particulate emissions, exhaust
backpressure, and control functions for a harmonic torque rise of the engine. The control unit
must be able to handle these non-linearities and to assure a stable boost pressure or boost pressure
buildup in the complete load and speed range of the engine, with good control dynamics. As the
discussion in chapters 9.3 and 9.4 has shown, this cannot be achieved with simple pi or pid control
units. In addition, the control unit has to compensate for tolerances in the charger itself as well as
for deteriorations in charger performance within its lifecycle.
For these reasons, vw applied for their vtg diesel engines, e.g., the tdi engine rated at 81kW, a
pdi control unit with adaptive parameter selection and additional disturbance stabilization in order
to further improve the dynamics and stability of the control loop. As research has clearly proven
[75], an adjustment of the control parameters to each individual load point is absolutely necessary.
Figure9.28 shows the structure of this boost pressure control unit. The control parameters are
determined in engine bench tests, then deﬁned for all operating ranges and stored in the control
unit. A main adaptation parameter is the fuel consumption, calculated from injection quantity and
engine speed. To avoid an overshoot of the boost pressure at full load, a disturbance stabilization
is added, utilizing the values used for the calculation of the fuel consumption – and augmented by
the ambient pressure and the charge air temperature.
If the vtg charger is to become established in truck engines, further control parameters have
to be included, e.g., controlled exhaust gas recirculation, or even vtg-controlled engine braking.
As an example, Iveco introduced its Cursor-9 diesel engine with vtg charger utilizing the
control structure as shown in Fig.9.29.
Other manufacturers are also engaged in the development of vtg chargers for truck
applications. Such vtg chargers will allow not only to control or even increase the braking

9.3.7 Evaluation of VTG control strategies via numerical simulation models
As an example for numeric simulation, we will discuss the control process for a vtg turbine using
the 6-cylinder passenger car engine introduced in Sect.5.5. For such a study a simulation model
veriﬁed with extremely precise measurements should be used (Fig.9.30).
Within the scope of numeric simulations, the turbine position can be optimized in each phase
of the load increase. Target parameters may include, e.g., the charger response time, the air-to-fuel
ratio, the cylinder peak pressure, the gas exchange work, and the speciﬁc fuel consumption. In
the example discussed here, the ﬁrst version of the charger control system shows the vtg control

strategy discussed above, which is only seemingly target-oriented: Immediately after the sudden

and model-based pid control system (dot line) [29]
Once the limitation by either mean effective pressure or peak pressure or transmission torque
is reached, a further boost pressure increase would result in increased fuel consumption (retarded
ignition timing to limit peak pressure, high gas exchange work due to high exhaust backpressure).
Therefore, in this phase of the load change, the inlet blades of the variable-geometry turbine can
be further opened. Thus, also the air-to-fuel ratio does not increase into a range which would be
associated with higher fuel consumption. This approach is accompanied by improved speciﬁc fuel
consumption, e.g., a fuel quantity reduction of 3.6% for the example shown in Fig.9.31, which
simulates a vehicle acceleration in 5th gear from 80 to 120km/h.
With this control strategy, driving cycle simulations resulted in a fuel consumption improvement
of about 1.5% in the European mveg cycle (Fig.9.32).
In addition to an optimum control strategy, the layout and optimization of the control algorithms
is as important for the achievement of best engine operating conditions. Reference 29 describes
such a layout of a control algorithm, especially with regard to the minimization of boost pressure
overshoot, common to vtg chargers (as described in Sect.9.3.6; Fig.9.33).
By switching from a standard pi control loop to a model-based control algorithm, these
pressure overshoots can be signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig.9.34). This is important not only for the exact
adjustment of the air-to-fuel ratios during transient processes, but also in order to stay within given
peak ﬁring pressure limits of the engine, which could be exceeded in case of extreme overshoots
of boost pressure.
10 Instrumentation for recording the operating
data of supercharged engines on the engine
test bench
The importance of veriﬁcation of simulation models and results with measured data was mentioned
in Chap.9. Various measurement parameters are considered for such veriﬁcations, e.g., pressures,
temperatures, mass ﬂows, power, and speed. In this chapter we present a very compact overview
of the preferred measuring techniques and devices used for data acquisition. For a more detailed
study of this subject we refer to the pertinent literature [110].
Prior to more detailed presentation of the measurement techniques and methods, the parameters
to be measured have to be deﬁned. Figure10.1 shows a typical setup of the measuring points for a
bench test of a supercharged diesel engine, identifying these parameters.

10.1 Measurement layout
At the air inlet into the intake system, the ambient temperature T0 and the relative humidity PHI
are measured. The subsequent gas meter (e.g., by rgm Messtechnik GmbH) measures the volume
ﬂow. For that, besides the ambient pressure p0, also the air temperature TA at the intake into the
volume ﬂow measurement device is important, since the air mass ﬂow is calculated with these
parameters. The pressure and temperature change up to the compressor (e.g., in the air ﬁlter) is
recorded via the pressure and temperature parameters T11 and p11. Downstream of the compressor,
the compressor efﬁciency can be determined by measuring the pressure p21 and the temperature
T21 (here the measuring point has to be carefully selected). To evaluate the efﬁciency of the charge
air cooler as well as to calculate the volumetric efﬁciency of the engine, reduced to intake manifold
conditions, the measurement of p22 and T22 in the intake manifold is necessary.
On the exhaust gas side, it is advantageous to measure the individual cylinder exhaust gas
temperatures Tcyl,1–Tcyl,n in order to be able to compare the uniformity of the individual cylinders.
Pressurep3 andtemperatureT3 (indices31and32incaseofatwin-ﬂowturbine)shouldbemeasured
as close as possible to the inlet of the turbine. This allows an assessment of the turbine operational
characteristics, and the wall heat losses of the exhaust manifold.
Downstreamoftheturbine,besidesthetemperatureT41,thepressurep41 isofspecialimportance
for the determination of the backpressure caused by catalyst and mufﬂer. The exhaust gas sample
probes, which are necessary for the measurement of the raw emissions including particulate matter,
are collected in the exhaust system downstream of the turbine.
On the engine itself, besides speed n, torque T, and the inlet and outlet temperatures of the
coolant TW,int and TW,out, the lubrication oil inlet temperature Toil, and the oil pressure poil also have
to be measured continuously. Further important parameters which must be continuously recorded
are the fuel mass ﬂow ˙mF and the blowby volume ﬂow ˙V blowby.
Measurement parameters especially linked to the supercharging system are the speed of the
turbocharger, the position of the variable blades (compressor preswirl, diffuser blading, and turbine
guide blades), position of relief, blowby, and waste gate valves and pressure indications in the
cylinders and at carefully selected locations in the intake and exhaust systems.
Table10.1 shows a summary of an extended measurement data set for a typical engine
development test bench.
10.2 Engine torque
Engine torque represents a control measuring parameter for any engine test. Under steady-state
operation, it can be derived from the brace torque of the engine test bench. The bracing force
acting via a lever arm is measured via strain gage load cells or via precision balances. Depending
on the intended use and engine-power class of the supercharged engine to be tested, various test
benches may be utilized. The most common passive systems are eddy current brakes (Fig.10.2)
and hydraulic brakes (Fig.10.3). Eddy current brakes are utilized in wide power (10 to 1,000kW)
and speed (up to 20,000min−1) ranges. Hydraulic systems are favored for very large, medium- and
slow-speed engines.
In addition, the development of modern engines mandates that the transient behavior of the
engine can be already tested on the test bench. Accordingly, for this purpose electric 4-quadrant test
benches were developed, including control units, which enable both braking operation in generator
mode and electrically powered operation. In this case, torque can be transferred to the engine

Figure10.4 shows a cut-away view of such a 4-quadrant power brake.
The latter power brakes are even used for the development of F1 racing engines. To execute
the actual speed gradients, coasting and braking powers of 1,000kW must be covered. The speed
range of these power brakes extends up to 22,000min−1 (utilizing a reduction stage). The maximum
possible speed gradient is about 30,000min−1/s.
10.3 Engine speed
Engine speed is often measured electrically inside the power brake of the test bench. On the other
hand, corresponding measuring devices can also be ﬁtted to the engine itself. Optical measuring
instruments, either reﬂecting or absorbing infrared light signals from a measuring disc equipped
10.4 Turbocharger speed
187
Fig. 10.4. Cut-away view of an electric 4-quadrant power brake (up
to 800 kW)
with angle or trigger markers, are favored. The change in light intensity is transformed by the
infrared sensor into a pulse signal. After digitalization of the signal, the speed can be determined
from counting the pulse signals per time unit. The angle marker signal can additionally be used
to control measured parameters which must be resolved by angle, e.g., pressure indications.
Figure10.5 shows such an angle transmitter for speed measurement of rotating components.
10.4 Turbocharger speed
Measuring devices such as the angle transmitter using discs with markers are not suited for the
measurement of turbocharger speed. The very sensitive rotor dynamics of the turbocharger would
be severely disturbed by the slightest changes in the rotor assembly. Therefore, optical methods
are usually used for turbocharger speed measurement. Such sensors, specially developed for
turbocharger speeds up to 200,000min−1 without affecting the charger, are suited for measurements
under both steady-state and transient engine operating conditions. A laser beam is targeted on the
compressor impeller, where it is reﬂected once per revolution from a reﬂecting marker. The sensor
receives the signal and converts it into an output value consisting of a periodic sequence of voltage
signals which then can be utilized for further signal processing (e.g., avl Trigger Box TB350 for

enables measuring without an impact on the intake air ﬂow.
10.5 Engine air mass ﬂow
A further essential measuring parameter is the engine air mass ﬂow. Usually, it is determined
indirectly via a volume ﬂow measurement, combined with a determination of the density of the
intake air. Experience shows that sound and exact results are obtained with rotary piston gas meters,
especially if a damping chamber is added as a buffer volume just downstream of the gas meter.
Figure10.7 shows an example of such a measuring device.
The perfect suitability of these devices for the volume ﬂow measurement of the engine air ﬂow
is emphasized by their very minor measuring error (<1% between 5 and 100% of the maximum
measuring range) and their small pressure losses (up to 5mbar at maximum ﬂow rate).

Fig. 10.8. Fuel balance for gravimetric fuel consumption measurement
10.6 Fuel mass ﬂow
The fuel mass ﬂow has to be measured very precisely since it directly inﬂuences the corresponding
speciﬁc fuel consumption of the engine. In principle, this measurement can also be performed
indirectly on the basis of a volume ﬂow measurement. Due to the additional inaccuracy in the
determination of the fuel density, this way of measurement could include a relatively large margin of
error. Therefore, the measurements should preferably be performed using the gravimetric principle.
Here, the fuel mass consumed per time unit, i.e., the ﬂow rate, is directly determined by a balance
(deﬂection according to change in mass). With known characteristics of the balance, this assures
a consistent accuracy of the measurement in the complete measuring range, i.e., also at very low
absolute fuel ﬂow values. Figure10.8 shows a sketch of a fuel balance operating to this principle.
10.7 Engine blowby
A further mass ﬂow to be determined during bench tests is the engine blowby. As experience has
proven, an indirect measurement is most appropriate, where the pressure loss at a calibrated oriﬁce
associated with a particular volume ﬂow is measured. Figure10.9 shows the schematic layout of
such a measuring device.
10.8 Pressure and temperature data
Especially for supercharged engines, the measurement of the pressure and temperature data in
the intake and exhaust systems is important. Generally, this means the time-averaged data, i.e., the
mean values during the engine cycle. Due to the cyclic behavior of piston engines, the instantaneous
values, resolved by crank angle, deviate substantially from these averaged data. This was shown in
Sect.5.5.3 by means of measured and calculated intake and exhaust manifold pressures. Thus, in
addition to the average values, the variations in time have to be measured via pressure indications.
These indications are especially important in the combustion chamber, since they enable a direct
analysis of the engine high-pressure cycle.

For these measurements, angle resolutions of 0.1 to 0.2◦crank angle should be chosen. On the
one hand, this will result in a sufﬁcient density of the signal data allowing, if needed, data ﬁltering.
On the other hand, for the analysis of the cylinder high-pressure signal (e.g., determination of the
combustion characteristics) it will provide exact information regarding the pressure gradients.
For the determination of the average values (in the intake and exhaust systems), the static
pressures are acquired via pressure bores in the pipe wall. The signal is converted by a pressure
transducer (usually based on a strain gage sensor) into a voltage signal which is proportional
to the pressure. Depending on the sensor characteristics and calibration, the signal can then be
linearized and analyzed. The transient (dynamic) pressure indication is performed via special
pressure pickups, often piezoelectric sensors (pressure application leads to a charge change in a
crystal) or strain gage load cells. The location of these sensors must be very carefully chosen, since
ﬂow disturbances (separation effects) may lead to signiﬁcant errors in the measurement signal.
Figure10.10 shows possible installation locations in the combustion chamber as well as a cross
section of such a sensor.
Up to temperatures of 300 ◦C, mean temperatures are measured via Pt-100 sensors. Mean
temperatures up to 1,000 ◦C can be measured using NiCr-Ni thermocouples type K. The Pt-100
sensors are based on the principle of resistance thermometers, which show a direct proportionality
between the temperature and the resistance of the sensor. In contrast, the NiCr-Ni sensors operate
on the basis of the principle of thermocouples, which – at the joining of different metals – generate
an increasing voltage when the temperature is increased. Figure10.11 shows typical characteristics
of resistance thermometers and thermocouples.
With temperature measurement data, as well as the corresponding simulation data, it generally
has to be considered that the instantaneous temperatures ﬂuctuating around the mean value –
especially pronounced in the exhaust system – also occur at differing mass ﬂows. This also

Therefore, the simulation values for the corresponding measurement points should be weighted by
Eq. (10.1) before they are compared to the actually measured data.
10.9 Emission data
Finally, for a full assessment of the engine operating behavior it is also necessary to measure and
analyze the engine’s emission data. A distinction is made between the gaseous exhaust emissions
and the soot and particulate matter emissions.
192
Instrumentation for operation data recording
In the broadest sense, the group of gaseous emissions covers the following:
all unburned hydrocarbons
carbon monoxide
all nitrogen oxides NOx (sum of NO and NO2)
fraction of non-methane hydrocarbons
methanol and formaldehyde fractions
The latter two components relate to special rules and regulations in the United States and
have to be measured only for corresponding applications. When measuring the gaseous emission
components, all or a part of the engine exhaust gas is mixed with a calibrated dilution air mass
ﬂow. The emission concentrations in the total gas ﬂow are related to those of the known dilution
mass ﬂow. Additionally, the dilution simulates after-reactions of the exhaust gas in the atmosphere
and prevents water condensation during the measurement. Subsequently, the gas mixture is either
collected in exhaust gas collection bags – whose contents are measured after the test via gas
analyzers for CO, CO2, and NOx concentrations – or is routed to a continuously operating exhaust
gas analyzer. In contrast to this, the HC measurement is performed via a separate, heated, probe,
which routes the exhaust gas directly to a continuously measuring hfid (heated ﬂame ionisation
detector).
Soot and particulate matter emissions are determined via the black smoke number and exhaust
gas opacity, and as emissions of particulate matter. The ﬁrst is measured via the calibrated optical
density of a ﬁlter paper, under both steady-state and transient operating conditions. Opacity
measurements are based on a (calibrated) reduction of the translucence of the exhaust gas by soot,
fuel, lubricating oil, and water vapor particles. It enables a continuous measurement, allowing
a very good resolution of dynamic processes. Particulate matter is measured gravimetrically, by
weighing the mass of soot and its attached soluble (fuel and lubricating oil) and insoluble (sulfur
compounds, water, ash and wear particles) components deposited on a ﬁlter.

Finally, particulate matter analysis methods should be mentioned which are capable of
measuring particulate emissions – under steady-state and transient engine operating conditions – in
respect to the number of particles and their size, in form of size spectra (particle size as a function of
particle size class). Mobility spectrometers are capable to perform such measurements (DDMPS,
dual differential mobility particle spectrometer, or TDMPS, transient differential mobility particle
spectrometer).
Figure10.12 shows the layout principle of such an exhaust emission measurement system.
11 Mechanics of superchargers
This chapter will cover especially the mechanical and production engineering-related topics of
superchargers.
11.1 Displacement compressors
Displacement compressors particularly are piston compressors of different shapes (e.g., rotary
piston compressors), screw-type compressors and spiral compressors. As an example, Fig.11.1
shows a spiral charger (Ecodyno) for two delivery volumes. This again shows clearly that the
overall size of a displacement compressor increases about linearly with increasing volume ﬂow.
Figure11.1a shows the model S-100/35, rated at a geometric delivery volume of about 700cm3.
Figure11.1b shows the model S-100/50 with a geometric delivery volume of about 1,000cm3,
about 40% more than the S-100/35. If the effective compressor length of the smaller compressor
is deﬁned as 100%, the length of the larger compressor is increased by about the same percentage.
11.1.1 Housing and rotors: sealing and cooling
With the exception of the spiral charger, all displacement compressors are rotary piston chargers,
either with or without internal compression. Today, housings and rotors of these are mostly
manufactured by pressure die casting.

11.2 Exhaust gas turbochargers
195
The machining of the charger rotors poses problems primarily for two reasons. First, in order
to reduce noise emissions, the blade conﬁgurations in most cases are highly twisted and partially
interlocked. Second, the thermal expansion of the housing and of the rotors is different. This makes
it difﬁcult to achieve a good sealing between rotor and housing, and between the rotors themselves,
which is a mandatory requirement for high efﬁciencies and small gap losses. To increase its rigidity,
the housing itself is designed with ribbings, which additionally complicates the goal of similar heat
dissipation of housing and rotors in order to obtain similar component heating and thus similar
component expansion.
Today, sealing between housing and rotor as well as between the rotors is mostly accomplished
by applying an abrasive lubricating layer (graphite-containing paste) on the rotors and/or housing.
In the initial break-in phase of the charger, abrasion of the sealant layer achieves a uniform and very
narrow gap between housing and rotor, and from rotor to rotor. This play adjusts itself corresponding
to the maximum expansion differences and the highest temperature differences occurring during
compressor operation, but only stays constant as long as no excessive component heating occurs,
e.g., by overloading the charger. Thus, the narrowest gaps are optimally adjusted only for the most
adverse operation case, and all other operating points must manage with these sealing gaps.
The charger type therefore also has to be selected under consideration of the number and size
of sealings in the frontal and circumferential areas of the charger, and the maximum glide speeds
occurring during operation. Today, maximum glide speeds of about 60m/s are allowed.
11.1.2 Bearing and lubrication
For rotary piston and spiral chargers, only ball bearings are used today. On the one hand, this is
due to their extremely small bearing width, which also inﬂuences the possible sealing gap size, on
the other hand, because of better lubrication conditions.
11.2 Exhaust gas turbochargers
In the discussion of exhaust gas turbocharger designs and their production methods, one has to
distinguish between the small chargers as used in passenger cars and trucks, which are produced
in large numbers and must be very inexpensive [98], and the large (heavy-duty) chargers produced
in small quantities and developed with the goal of highest efﬁciencies and pressure ratios, which
are used in medium-speed and slow-speed heavy-duty engines.
11.2.1 Small chargers
11.2.1.1 Housing: design, cooling and sealing
Today, in mass production, the housing of exhaust gas turbochargers consists of three parts: the
actual bearing housing with the mounted compressor and turbine wheels and the housings for
compressor and turbine attached to it.
Compressor housing
The compressor housing surrounds the impeller and additionally contains the inlet for the air into
the charger, the diffuser (generally without blades), the volute, which is the air-collecting plenum,
and possibly additional air and recirculation channels for ﬂow-stabilizing measures. Nowadays,
most compressor housings are cast from aluminum or magnesium.
196
Mechanics of superchargers
Turbine housing
The turbine housing correspondingly surrounds the turbine wheel, mostly a centripetal rotor.
Additionally, it contains the exhaust gas intake and, for ﬁxed geometry chargers, the turbine inlet
cone integrated into the housing, as well as (in most cases) the waste gate. For vtg chargers,
the turbine inlet blades, including their adjustment mechanism, are mounted on a special disc-
shaped shield which is connected to the bearing housing. Turbine housings are cast. For special
applications, e.g., marine, where the surface of the complete exhaust system may not exceed a
speciﬁed temperature limit, water-cooled housings are used (see bearing housing, below).
The materials to be used have to be selected depending on the actual exhaust gas temperatures.
For temperatures up to 750 ◦C, GGGX-SiMo51 is used today; this covers most diesel engine
applications. For higher temperatures up to about 850 ◦C, mostly GGG NiCr 20 2 (D2) is used. For
highest exhaust gas temperatures up to a maximum of 1,050 ◦C, i.e., gasoline engines, GGG NiCr
35 5 2 (D5) is used. If a compressor impeller or turbine rotor bursts, the debris must not penetrate the
corresponding housing. This mandates sufﬁciently dimensioned wall thicknesses of both housings.
Compliance with this requirement is tested in a so-called containment test. Here, the rotor is
accelerated to the point of bursting. Then the containment safety of the housings is analyzed. With
the rotor materials mentioned above, the bursting speed is approximately 50% above the maximum
acceptable operating speed.
Bearing housing
The bearing housing contains the bearings for the rotor assembly, the corresponding lubricating and
cooling oil circuit, the shaft seals towards compressor and turbine housings, and the thermal pro-
tection shields of the bearings. In most cases the bearings are located inside, i.e., between the com-
pressor and the turbine. Due to the small distance between the bearings and the hot turbine housing,
substantial heat ﬂows occur to the bearing next to the turbine – increased by the heat ﬂow inside the
charger shaft. With insufﬁcient thermal protection, this can lead to oil coking and, consequently,
failure of lubrication and/or solid material friction, in any case in increased bearing wear. Depending
on the highest occurring temperatures, the following design variants help to avoid such problems.
With an appropriate bearing housing design (Fig.11.2), the bearing block located next to the
turbine has to be thermally decoupled by maximizing the length of the heat conduction path. For
example, the connection between the bearing block and the bearing housing can be designed in such
a way that it is routed towards the compressor side and behind the oil intake. Further improvement is
achieved by a so-called heat shield arranged in the back of the turbine rotor, which to a large extent
prevents direct contact between the hot exhaust gases and the bearing housing. An additional oil-jet
cooling on the hot side of the charger shaft reduces the heat input by the shaft into the bearing.
Cooling
For gasoline engines, where the exhaust gas temperatures are 200 to 300 ◦C higher than for diesel
engines, charger housings mostly are equipped with additional water cooling (Fig.11.3). In this
case, the bearing housing is integrated into the cooling circuit of the engine. If problems with heat
accumulation occur, e.g., when the engine is stopped immediately after operation at high load,
a small thermostat-controlled auxiliary water pump has to be utilized to ﬂush the water-cooled
bearing housing also after the engine and, thus, the main water pump were stopped.
The thermal stability of a charger is veriﬁed by a start–stop test in which the charger is equipped
with temperature sensors at typically critical locations. Then the engine is operated at full-load and
immediately stopped, which is repeated for a speciﬁed number of cycles. The test is passed when

neither the maximum acceptable component temperatures are exceeded nor noteworthy amounts
of oil carbon are found.
Sealing system
At the shaft passage, the bearing housing has to be sealed off, on the one hand to prevent oil losses
both on the compressor and on the turbine side, on the other hand to prevent the hot exhaust gases
from ﬂowing from the turbine into the bearing housing. Mass-produced chargers are equipped with
one piston ring each, which sits in a corresponding groove of the rotor shaft (Fig.11.4). These piston
rings do not rotate but are rigidly held in the bearing housing and thus form a kind of noncontact
labyrinth seal.
In special turbocharger applications, e.g., for natural gas engines, the throttle, as the load-
controlling device, is often located upstream of the compressor. The reason for this is an improved
homogenization of the gas in the compressor, which results in better mixture formation. In this
case, substantial pressure drops below ambient conditions can occur in the compressor housing,
which cannot be handled adequately by the piston ring labyrinth seal described above. Here, an
additional seal, generally a carbon slip ring, has to be applied.
There are functional tests for all of these sealing systems. On an actual engine, the charger
performance is checked in the entire map. For the test of the sealing ring on the compressor side,
the pressure at the inlet to the compressor is lowered to a value which could occur in case of a
soiled air ﬁlter. To test the sealing on the turbine side, the engine crankcase pressure is increased

such that a plugged crankcase ventilation system is simulated. In both cases, no oil should leak
towards the corresponding rotors.
11.2.1.2 Rotor assembly: load and material selection
Independent of the turbocharger’s size and layout, the rotor assembly is the critical component. It
consists of the shaft, the compressor impeller attached to one side, and the turbine rotor attached to
the opposite side. For small turbochargers, used in passenger car and truck engines, mostly radial
compressor and turbine rotors are used; more recently, also mixed-ﬂow turbines are utilized, a
design combining axial and radial ﬂow characteristics.
Compressor impeller
Aluminum cast alloys are exclusively utilized as material for the compressor impeller. This includes
not only today’s passenger car and truck mass-produced chargers, but also larger high-speed
engines with several chargers. The acceptable circumferential speeds reach about 550m/s. If
reduced durability can be tolerated, higher circumferential speeds are possible. Further increases
are possible by applying measures to reduce stress peaks in the rotor, e.g., reinforcing the rotor
back in the vicinity of the hub (Fig.11.5). Fully machined rotors made of forged aluminum are
only utilized in special cases.
Turbine
Up to a diameter of about 150mm, turbines are today exclusively designed as radial or mixed-ﬂow
tangential turbines. With decreasing diameter, this design shows better efﬁciencies than comparable
axial turbines. Additionally, in combination with turbine housings without inlet guide blades, it can
be produced at low cost. Due to the high turbine inlet temperatures, the materials used must still
offer sufﬁcient strength to carry the stresses caused by the circumferential speeds as required for the
compression process. Nowadays, for mass-produced turbines essentially two materials are utilized:
–
gmr 235 for exhaust gas temperatures up to approximately 850 ◦C at the turbine inlet, i.e.,
primarily for applications with diesel engines,
–
Inconel713(73%Ni,13%Cr)forexhaustgastemperaturesupto1,050 ◦C,i.e.,forturbocharged
gasoline engines.
The main components of both castable alloys are nickel and chromium.

11.2 Exhaust gas turbochargers
199
11.2.1.3 Bearing, lubrication, and shaft dynamics
The rotors of the mass-produced turbochargers described here reach speeds of up to 200,000min−1.
At the same time, their durability should be guaranteed for up to 1 million km (truck applications).
Only specially developed ﬂoating bearing systems can satisfy these stringent requirements reliably
and at low cost.
Radial bearing with ﬂoating bushing
In this design, ﬂoating bearing bushings are arranged between the compressor- and turbine-side
bearing blocks in the bearing housing. Within these bushings, the shaft can rotate, without wear,
in an oil ﬁlm. The bushing itself also rotates in an oil ﬁlm between bearing block and bushing, in
such a way that the bushing, made of brass, rotates at about half of the shaft speed, i.e., it ﬂoats.
Thus, the friction speed in the bearing can be halved. In addition, the double oil ﬁlm acts as an
improved damper, resulting in more stable dynamics of the rotor shaft (Fig.11.2).
With the proper choice of the lubrication gap widths between bearing block and bushing and
between bushing and shaft, the hydrodynamic load capacity of the bearing and its damping behavior
can be optimized. Here, the lubrication gap width between shaft and bushing is dimensioned under
the aspect of load capacity, while the gap between bushing and bearing block is dimensioned
under the aspect of optimized damping. Increasing lubrication gap widths increase the damping
and reduce the load capacity.
Single bushing bearing
Single bushing bearings are regaining importance in mass-produced turbochargers. Here, the rotor
shaft rotates within a single, long and ﬁxed bushing, which on its outside is surrounded by oil
(Fig.11.6). In this case, since there is no rotation, the outer gap of the bearing can be especially
optimized for bearing damping. The bushing is recessed on both sides in its center part. This design
makes a smaller bearing span in the bearing block possible, which results in a shorter total length
of the turbocharger. The assembly is easier, resulting in lower production costs.
Neither the ﬂoating bushing nor the single bushing bearing carry forces in axial direction.
However, as a rule, compressor and turbine rotors are subject to different gas forces, which would
lead to a lateral movement of the rotor assembly. To prevent this, a further bearing, the axial bearing,
is necessary.
single bushing bearing
Fig. 11.6. Design example of a ﬂoating single bushing bearing
200
Mechanics of superchargers
Axial bearing
The axial bushing carries forces in axial direction. Today, it is mostly designed as a wedge surface
friction bearing. Two discs serve as stop face. These are rigidly connected to the shaft, while the
axial bearing itself is mounted in the housing. An oil deﬂection plate prevents too much oil from
getting close to the shaft seal.
Lubrication
Today, all turbochargers are lubricated with engine oil and integrated into the engine’s oil circuit.
Thus, the necessary lubricating oil enters the bearing housing at a pressure of about 4bar, where a
throttle reduces the pressure to about 2bar before it is routed to the bearings. Oil drainage occurs at
ambient pressure. To assure an unobstructed oil drainage, the drainage pipe must be dimensioned
correctly and the oil feedback position into the engine must be located above the engine’s oil level.
Balancing
Rotor assemblies – such as those in a turbocharger – rotating at very high speeds naturally have to
be balanced particularly well. The components – the turbine rotor with shaft and the compressor
impeller – are individually prebalanced. After assembly, they are ﬁne-balanced in the completed
turbocharger (also see Sect.11.2.1.4).
Rotor dynamics
During operation, the rotor assembly of any turbocharger is inﬂuenced in its rotary motion by
the pulsating admission of exhaust gas into the turbine, its own residual imbalance, and by the
mechanical vibrations of the combustion engine. This may excite vibrations in the rotor assembly.
Nowadays, these rotor dynamics and the associated shaft shift paths of the rotor assembly
are carefully simulated and also measured. The goal is to avoid excessive deﬂections of the rotor
assembly in the bearings, which – especially in combination with low lubricating-oil pressures and
high oil temperatures – may lead to instabilities and metallic contact, resulting in increased bearing
wear.
Turbine blade vibrations
The excitations mentioned above may cause similar problems for the turbine blades as were
discussed for the rotor dynamics. This can lead to undesired blade resonance vibrations,
endangering both the charger’s reliability and durability. The dynamic loads of the turbine blades
occurring under full-load engine operating conditions are therefore measured via suitably arranged
strain gage load cells; then they are analyzed, and the blades are optimized in regard to their
vibration behavior.
11.2.1.4 Production
On the one hand, function and operating conditions of turbochargers are demanding high production
precision and quality. On the other hand, the complete charger is subject to strong cost pressure.
Since turbochargers are produced in ever larger quantities, their production processes have been
continually improved and reﬁned. At the same time, the production costs decreased signiﬁcantly.
Therefore, within the scope of this book, the production sequence can only be covered brieﬂy and
with few examples. The special production know-how that has rendered today’s turbochargers into
cost-efﬁcient, durable, and reliable products, essentially is the manufacturers’ domain.
11.2 Exhaust gas turbochargers
201
Production of the turbine rotor and connection with the shaft
As previously explained, turbine rotors are made of high-temperature nickel alloys which must
be melted and cast under vacuum. The necessary ceramic shell forms are produced utilizing the
lost-wax casting process. First, the wax models necessary for each rotor are combined, at 1:1 scale,
in cast clusters. Then, by dipping them several times into a ceramic slurry and subsequent sanding,
they are covered with a 6–10mm thick, ﬁreproof ceramic shell. After the drying and setting of the
shell, the wax models are melted out and the resulting casting molds can be baked. The actual raw
parts are cast in these molds, which are heated during casting. After cool-down, the shell can be
removed, the castings can be cut off the cluster, and they can be machined.
The cleaned and occasionally reworked turbine rotor is connected to the charger shaft via
friction welding. The shaft is coupled to a ﬂywheel mass and accelerated to a speed of about
1,000min−1. Then the drive and ﬂywheel mass is disconnected and the shaft is pressed against the
stationary rotor with a predetermined force. The resulting friction heats up the shaft and rotor to
such an extent that both components are welded to each other.
After friction welding, the next steps are stress-free annealing and subsequent machining
of the shaft. The bearings are hardened and the complete rotor is subjected to further heat
treatment. The ﬁnal dimensions are achieved by grinding, where especially strict requirements
for dimensional accuracy and roundness have to be met. Then the outer contour of the turbine
rotor is ground and the grooves for the sealing piston rings are machined. Finally, utilizing special
machines, the completed turbine–shaft combination is balanced by countersinking the back of the
turbine.
Production of the compressor impeller
The production of the compressor impeller starts with a master form produced on a 5-axis milling
machine. On the basis of the master form, a master mold – a hollow form – is produced from
which the so-called work models – made of rubber – are extracted. Mounted on a worktop, the
rubber work model is used to produce hard plaster models. After drying, the rubber model must
be extracted from the plaster model. This is done by a rotary motion of the rubber model, where
the model must not be damaged.
This production manner of course inﬂuences the form of the elastic rubber model and
accordingly that of the possible compressor impeller and its contours. The hard plaster models
are then clamped between plates, where they act as casting molds for the aluminum die cast of
the impellers. The machining of the compressor impeller starts with the insertion of the center
bore where concentricity between impeller molding blank and bore is assured by special clamping
ﬁxtures.
Subsequently, impeller back and contour are machined. When ﬁnished, the compressor impeller
is also balanced.
Production of compressor and turbine housings
The molding blanks of both housings are cast from the respective materials chosen. Subsequent
machining encompasses lathing, drilling, and milling, performed on cnc machines (computer
numerical control). Final machining, which includes the milling of the ﬂange faces as well as
insertion of bores and screw threads, is performed using circular transfer machines. Since the
compressor housings are mostly made of aluminum die cast, due to their high cast accuracy and
good surface quality, they only need minimal ﬁnal machining. At the end of machining, the turbine
housings are deburred and preserved to prevent corrosion.
202
Mechanics of superchargers
Machining of the bearing housing
Similar to the turbine housing, the machining of the bearing housing – which is cast in gray
iron – is performed on multiple-spindle cnc machines. The connecting ﬂanges on both turbine
and compressor sides have to be lathed, and the bearing bore has to be drilled and either ground or
honed. The bearing housing is protected against corrosion as well.
Assembly
The assembly process is divided into the core assembly and the ﬁnal assembly. In between, the
complete rotor assembly is again ﬁne balanced at high speed in the core assembly. This core
assembly consists of bearing unit, rotor assembly and compressor back wall. During assembly,
ﬁrst the bearings are installed into the bearing housing, then the turbine rotor–shaft combination
including the sealing piston rings is inserted into the bearing. The axial bearing is installed and the
compressor back wall is attached with bolts. Subsequently, the compressor impeller is slipped on
the still-open shaft end and braced with a shaft nut. In mass production, the complete core assembly
is performed automatically.
In the following ﬁnal assembly, at group-work stations the compressor and turbine housings
are assembled and, if needed, the waste gate or vtg mechanisms attached and tuned. This ﬁnalizes
the production of the turbocharger and it is delivered as a supplier component to the engine
manufacturer.
11.2.2 Large chargers
In applications with medium-speed and slow-speed heavy-duty engines, rated between 1,000 and
nearly 10,000kW per cylinder, the exhaust gas turbocharger – today exclusively used here – is
an essential design element which signiﬁcantly inﬂuences power, fuel consumption, and installed
size. Both its conceptual design and its production are, therefore, subject to considerations totally
different from those for the previously discussed mass-produced charger. Between these two
extremes, naturally many intermediate stages exist. Within the scope of this book, only the other
extreme, the truly large charger, will be discussed.
11.2.2.1 Design, housing, cooling, sealing
Design
While the assembly of small chargers generally involves four components – the rotor assembly,
bearing housing, turbine and compressor housings – the design of a large charger is much more
complex. Fully machined compressor impellers and bladed diffusers are used, as well as axial
turbines with external intake and central exhaust gas outlet, which necessitates a totally different
design for the bearing housing (see below). As an example for a large charger, Fig.5.39 shows a
na/s charger by man.
Bearing
The bearing is also quite different to that of a small charger. While small chargers are
designed exclusively with "inside" bearings, large chargers predominantly use "outside" bearings.
Figure11.7 shows a layout principle. Further, in most cases roller bearings with their own oil supply
are used, for the following reasons:
lower power losses at normal speeds
high short-term overload capability of the roller bearings

The forces acting on the rotor assembly of a turbocharger are shown in Fig.11.8. Looking at
these forces and considering the durability requirements of slow-speed engines, it can be easily
seen that signiﬁcantly higher effort has to be invested in the bearing design of these chargers than
for the small chargers.
As an example, Fig.11.9 shows a compressor-side double-ball roller bearing with dampening
intermediate layer at the outer rings and its own splash-disc oil pump. Besides this design, so-called
four-point bearings are also utilized, as shown in Fig.11.10 in combination with an oil-jet pump,
or regular double-ball bearings (Fig.11.11) in combination with a hollow-shaft oil pump and a
gear-oil pump.
Compressor housing
The compressor housing is the ﬁrst especially complex component of large chargers to be discussed
here. Usually, it consists of a ring-shaped and strongly tapered air intake to the compressor. On the
intake side, a coaxially arranged lamella mufﬂer is attached to dampen the compressor noise and
to stabilize the intake air ﬂow (Fig.11.12).
204

Fig. 11.12. Compressor housing (left), exhaust gas plenum housing (center) and turbine housing (right) of a large charger
with intake mufﬂer
Inside the housing, which is reinforced by molded support struts, the compressor-side bearing,
dampened at the outer ring, is installed close to the compressor impeller; the housing also includes
the integrated oil pump and the oil tank. In most cases a double-ball bearing is used, which also
carries the axial forces of the rotor assembly. The generally bladed outlet diffuser with subsequent
air plenum is a further component which is additionally used as a connection to the exhaust
plenum.
11.2 Exhaust gas turbochargers
205
Exhaust gas plenum
The exhaust gas plenum (Fig.11.12) collects the exhaust gases ﬂowing from the axial turbine
towards the compressor housing and usually routes the gas upwards into the exhaust gas manifold.
Together with the compressor housing, it represents the load-bearing element of the charger. It
is water-cooled in order to avoid thermal distortions, since those would negatively inﬂuence the
viable gap dimensions between compressor and compressor housing as well as turbine and turbine
housing. Additionally, distortions could lead to bearing alignment problems. The exhaust gas
plenumhasaninnerprotectivelinerwithﬂange,concentrictothechargershaft.Itisdirectlyattached
to the turbine housing to assure bearing alignment. This arrangement protects the penetrating
charger shaft from excessive heat loading. The turbine housing is located on the other side of the
exhaust gas plenum.
Turbine housing
Also the turbine housing (Fig.11.12) has a concentric, towards the axial turbine tapered (cone
shaped), exhaust gas intake. The inlet guide blade ring and the outer turbine ring are attached to
it. Via a concentric neck it assures an aligned connection to the compressor housing. Thus it also
closes the manifold to shield it from exhaust gas.
The turbine-side roller bearing is arranged inside the turbine housing. Usually, it is an axially
movable and also dampened roller bearing, in order to accommodate the thermal expansion of the
charger shaft. It also features its own lubricating oil supply including pump and reservoir. The
complete housing is water-cooled. A double labyrinth seal on the charger shaft protects against
exhaust gas entering from the turbine into the bearing housing.
Charger shaft
The charger shaft is also much more complex than that for small chargers. Due to the out-
side bearings, which enable a larger distance between the bearings, the shaft must be care-
fully calculated and optimized regarding bending and torsional vibration modes and natural
frequencies. Since high power must be transmitted into the compressor impeller, the connections
have to be dimensioned carefully. On the turbine side, the shaft carries the rotor wheel for
the axial blades, which are usually supported in the wheel via self-centering ﬁr-tree dovetail
connection.
Cooling
Theoretically, ample cooling of all hot components seems to be extremely desirable to limit
distortion and assure proper bearing alignment, as well as to guarantee cool bearings and oil
supply. However, considering the fact that the use of heavy oil is mandatory for large low-speed
engines and this is usually associated with the danger of coking and contamination, attention has
to be paid that the contamination-endangered components remain at sufﬁciently high temperatures
to avoid coking. Therefore, the cooling system must be strategically designed to result in a desired
and particular coexistence of insulation and cooling measures.
11.2.2.2 Rotor assembly
Compressor impeller
In order to optimize efﬁciency, the ﬂow guiding components as well must be machined as precise
as possible. Production costs are of much lower importance. Also in this case, all impellers are
radial and mostly manufactured from titanium; they are machined from solid metal by means of

5-axis milling machines. Strongly twisted and backswept blades with reset intermediate blades are
state of the art (Fig.11.13).
Circumferential speeds of up to about 600m/s are possible. The described high-power compres-
sor impellers are more and more combined with proﬁle-bladed diffusers for further efﬁciency
increase. The compressor efﬁciencies, thus, achieve values of up to 88%.
Turbine
The turbine of large chargers is for the most part designed as an axial turbine. This design exhibits
explicit advantages in efﬁciency in comparison to a radial turbine at diameters of more than
300mm. The turbine can be optimally adjusted to particular supercharging requirements with
relatively simple changes in blade length. Today, turbine efﬁciencies of up to 85% can be achieved
(Fig.11.14) in combination with an upstream guide ring equipped either with molded blades
or – more and more – with variable-geometry blades, as well as downstream exhaust diffusers.
Various design variants for attaching exhaust manifold branches to the turbine housing are shown
in Fig.11.15.

11.2.2.3 Production
Large chargers described in this chapter are always manufactured in very small numbers. They are
produced in the most modern machining centers, where the highest demands regarding production
accuracy, low tolerances, and reproducibility can be met.
12 Charge air coolers and charge air cooling
systems
As shown in Chap.2, charge air cooling plays a decisive role in the design of supercharged engines
with high power density, low fuel consumption, and low emissions. Therefore, special attention
has to be paid to the layout of charge air cooling systems and their components for speciﬁc engine
concepts and applications. For this purpose, knowledge about different cooler designs and suitable
charge air cooling systems is as important as knowledge about their respective characteristics.
12.1 Basics and characteristics
The density of the air aspirated by the engine depends on its pressure and temperature (ρ = ρ/RT).
Therefore, the objective is to achieve high boost pressures at a temperature increase as low as
possible.
Real compressors feature efﬁciencies ηs-i,C < 1 (as compared to the ideal isentropic
compression process). Therefore, the actual compression of the air results in a signiﬁcant
temperature increase. This increase depends on the pressure ratio selected and on the compressor
efﬁciency, as shown in Fig.12.1. It can be described by the following equation:
T = T2 −T1 = (T2 −T1)s/ηs-i,C = T1

(p2/p1)(κ−1)/κ −1

/ηs-i,C.
(12.1)
As can be seen, even at very good efﬁciencies of ηs-i,C = 0.8, the temperature is increased at a
pressure ratio of  = 3 by approximately 135 ◦C.
Consequently, a density increase ρ2/ρ1 of only about 2 can be achieved (Fig.12.2) at the
selected pressure ratio.
If the density is to be increased as much as possible, the charge air must be cooled down to
achieve a density recovery. Air and water can be utilized as coolants. The intercooler efﬁciency
is the characteristic used to assess the quality of the charge air cooling. It is deﬁned as the ratio
between the actual and the maximum possible heat removal:
ηCAC = (T2 −T 2
′)/(T2 −TC),
(12.2)
where T2 and T 2′ describe the charge air temperature up- and downstream of the charge air cooler
and TC describes the coolant temperature.
As an example, again assuming a compressor efﬁciency of ηs-i,C = 0.8, a pressure ratio of 3,
and an ambient, i.e., coolant, temperature TC of 20 ◦C, an increase in the density ratio up to 2.7 is
possible (Fig.12.3) depending on the intercooler efﬁciency ηCAC.

ηρ = ρ/ρmax.

12.2 Design variants of charge air coolers
In principle, charge air coolers (intercoolers) consist of a number of heat transfer areas which route
the charge air and coolant ﬂows in such a way that no mixing occurs between the media and the heat
transfer is as good as possible. To achieve this, ﬁns are arranged in the respective ﬂow channels to
increase their surfaces and thus increase the heat transfer. The heat transfer occurs directly via the
described walls and ﬁns. Therefore, they have to be made of a material that effectively conducts

Fig. 12.5. Design of charge air heat exchangers: (a) single-cross-ﬂow
heat exchanger, (b) double cross-counter-ﬂow heat exchanger
heat; in general, metal is used. To minimize the design complexity, the ﬂows of the media are
routed according to either the cross- or the cross-counter-ﬂow principle (Fig.12.5). The charge air
cooler should transfer, i.e., conduct, heat at a transfer rate as high as possible. The heat transfer
rate is calculated as follows:
˙Q = k · AC · T,
(12.4)
where k describes the heat transfer coefﬁcient and AC the cooling surface. Both factors, k and AC,
depend on the intercooler size and design, while T exists as a boundary condition.
kAC is termed the heat transfer value. It depends on the following factors:
αin heat transfer coefﬁcient on the coolant side
αout heat transfer coefﬁcient on the charge air side
Ain cooling surface on the coolant side
Aout cooling surface on the charge air side
δ thickness of the transferring wall
λ thermal conductivity of the transferring wall
The relationship is as follows:
1
kAC
=
1
αinAin
+ δ
λ +
1
αoutAout
.
(12.5)
The equation shows the inﬂuences of charge air, coolant, and the walls in relation to the heat
transfer. The magnitude of this value is determined by the summands in the denominator, which
themselves depend on the intercooler:
size of the cooling surfaces Ain on the coolant side and Aout on the charge air side
heat transfer coefﬁcients αin and αout
quotient δ/λ of wall thickness and thermal conductivity of the wall
From Eq. (12.5) it can also be derived that the product αA has to be as large as possible to achieve
a high value of kAC, i.e., a high heat transfer value. This fact determines the intercooler design and
size. Accordingly, due to very differing properties of the possible coolants, air or water, the design
and layout of corresponding intercoolers is quite different.
Due to the similar order of α values on the coolant and charge air sides in air-to-air intercoolers,
the cooling surfaces Ain and Aout also must be about the same size.

For air-to-water intercoolers, the ratio of the α values between water and air is about 10:1.
Thus, the cooling surface on the air side always represents the limiting critical value. No ﬁns are
necessary on the water side.
Therefore, depending on the choice of coolant, very differing intercooler designs are possible.
Particularly if the operational inﬂuences of air and water as coolants are considered, especially
contamination and corrosion.
12.2.1 Water-cooled charge air coolers
Depending on the design, a distinction is made between round-tube and ﬂat-tube intercoolers.
Round-tube intercoolers
The core of the round-tube intercooler consists of a multitude of ﬁn plates which are crossed by
the tubes (Fig.12.6). The tubes are connected to the plate ﬂanges such that conduction of heat is
supported as good as possible. The connection is produced either by hydraulically or mechanically
expanding the tubes or by soft-soldering the plate ﬂanges to the tubes. The heat transfer quality of
these two methods is not signiﬁcantly different. However, there are major differences in view of
possible material combinations. When hydraulic expansion is chosen, nonsolderable combinations
can also be connected with sufﬁcient heat conductivity, e.g., stainless steel, copper, brass, or titan
(tubes) with ﬁns of copper or aluminum. Round-tube intercoolers are mostly used if the coolant is
untreated water or ocean water (most severe operating conditions). In this case, the coolant at least
has to be ﬁltered before entering the intercooler, and the intercooler has to be cleaned at regular
intervals. Further, due to contamination and corrosion, minimum and maximum water ﬂow rates
have to be observed and maintained, and occasional erosion damages at the tube inlets have to be
monitored.
In regard to their efﬁciency factor ηcyc,CAC = ˙Q/pLoss, round-tube intercoolers reach certain
limits. These can be signiﬁcantly extended if ﬂat-tube intercoolers of the same dimensions are
applied.
Flat-tube intercoolers
Due to the ﬂow efﬁcient shape on their charge air side, ﬂat-tube intercoolers generate less pressure
loss there. Thus, they can be equipped with a higher ﬁn density. However, the relatively narrow
tube channels are not suited for contaminated water and thus should only be used in closed-loop
cooling systems (Sect.12.3). Two designs exist for ﬂat-tube intercoolers.

Fig. 12.7. Flat-oval-tube lamella intercooler without interior ﬁns [115]
Fig. 12.8. Flat-tube intercooler in rod-sheet design [115]
In a combination of ﬂat-oval tubes with thin-walled tube bottoms (Fig.12.7), the tubes (with or
without internal ﬁns) are soldered to the air lamellas, side frames and tube bottoms. At the ends of
the intercooler cores, water plenums are welded or bolted on. This design requires special stamping
tools for the tube bottoms. Therefore, it can only be used economically in mass production.
In a combination of tube wall sheet metal and terminal ledges (Fig. 12.8), the completely brazed
intercooler block consists of sheet metal, rods and support lamellas, which together constitute the
water channels, as well as air-side lamellas and their side frames. The water plenums are welded
to the block ends. Since no expensive model-speciﬁc tools are necessary, this design is also suited
for low-volume production.
12.2.2 Air-to-air charge air coolers
For applications in aircraft or on-road as well as off-road vehicles where water is not directly
available as coolant, air-to-air charge air coolers have to be utilized. In these, in contrast to the
water-cooled intercoolers, the charge air ﬂows through ﬂat tubes, which in most cases are ﬁnned
on the inside. Cooling-air lamellas are arranged between these tubes. Figure12.9 shows such an
intercooler in rod-sheet design with interior-ﬁnned ﬂat tubes; Fig.12.10 shows one in ﬂat-oval-tube
lamella design, also with interior-ﬁnned ﬂat-oval tubes.
12.2.3 Full-aluminum charge air coolers
In order to further optimize the capacity, weight and production costs, intercoolers in increasing
numbers are made fully of aluminum. Here too, two differing designs can be chosen:
–
intercooler design with small block depth (about 30mm) and tubes without internal ﬁn, for
medium charge air mass ﬂows;
–
design with block depth of about 50 to 100mm, with turbulence inserts in the tubes, for
especially high-capacity requirements at high compactness.

Figure12.11 shows the capacities of various tube–ﬁn combinations for different block depths.
With these designs, it is also possible to combine several heat exchanger components in one unit –
a so-called monoblock.
12.3 Charge air cooling systems
The cooling systems always consist of the charge air cooler itself, the corresponding piping or
connections, and any additional components which may be needed for charge air heat management.
Two systems are primarily utilized: direct charge air cooling, with air or water as coolant, or indirect
charge air cooling with corresponding intercooler combinations.
Figure12.12 shows a layout principle of a direct charge air cooling system. If air-to-air cooling
is applied, the achievable temperature reduction and, thus, the achievable density recovery mainly
depend on the intercooler size and on its efﬁciency. T values of about 15–20 ◦C above the ambient,
i.e., coolant temperature, can be achieved. In systems with untreated water or ocean water cooling,
values of 5–10 ◦C above coolant temperature are even possible. A charge air heat management
system (e.g. cooling only at high loads or similar controls) can only be achieved with signiﬁcant
additional effort. On the other hand, the basic system is simple, robust, and low-cost.

Fig. 12.13. Principle layout for indirect charge air cooling [85]
Figure12.13 shows the indirect charge air cooling system. The actual charge air cooler is
designed as air-to-water charge air cooler, in a layout as compact as possible. It is cooled via
a second cooling circuit. Thus, with limited cooling surfaces in a vehicle, a higher temperature
reduction with improved density recovery becomes possible, accompanied by a smaller pressure
loss in the charge air system. Further, the charge air temperature can be effectively inﬂuenced via
a valve-controlled connection to the engine coolant circuit. This enables a very ﬂexible engine
heat management system. The necessity of an additional coolant pump is a clear disadvantage.
Altogether, the system is more complex, heavier, and more expensive.
13 Outlook and further developments
in supercharging
This chapter will examine potential future developments – based on the actual state of the art of
supercharging system design – using scenarios which are as realistic as possible.
13.1 Supercharging technologies: trends and perspectives
As mentioned in the historic overview, with the exception of inexpensive engines, i.e., very small
engines and the passenger car gasoline engine, practically all internal combustion engines are
supercharged today.
It is especially important for supercharging designs to be cost-effective. In the near future,
dramatic changes may occur. More stringent legislative boundary conditions and regulations for
internal combustion engines will limit noise and pollutant emissions, and will require improved
fuel economy.
The situation with medium- and heavy-truck, but also modern direct-injection passenger car
diesel engines may serve as an example. Without supercharging and charge air cooling, both of
these engine types could no longer comply with the pollutant emission standards imposed by law.
On the vehicle side, new features and functions are demanded, e.g., trucks with highly increased
engine braking power and passenger cars with further improved transient behavior. All this will
lead to a shift of the cost away from the basic engine, which must become less expensive, to more
powerful, multifunctional supercharging systems. Moreover, the constant cost pressure will lead
to higher degrees of supercharging. The passenger car gasoline engine will also have to follow the
trend towards supercharging, especially since here the potential for reduced fuel consumption is
by far greater than for diesel engines.
13.2 Development trends for individual supercharging systems
13.2.1 Mechanical chargers
Mechanical supercharging, i.e., supercharging by means of a displacement compressor
mechanically powered by the engine, is presently experiencing a remarkable renaissance in the
classic gasoline engine. On the one hand, the reasons for this can be found in the inherent problems
of exhaust gas turbocharging the gasoline engine, as was discussed at length. On the other hand, in
most cases the supercharged engine only represents the peak-power version of an engine family,
so that the supercharching system must be designed as an add-on. This can much more easily be
achieved with a supercharging system which does not have an impact on the hot side of the engine,
as compared to exhaust gas turbocharging.

Fig. 13.1. Map (a) and rotor pair (b) of a modern screw-type (Lysholm) compressor
Further, the mechanical charger can feature advantages with regard to its installation.
Marketing is an additional aspect. In the emotionally inﬂuenced passenger car market, a
component branding “Compressor” seems to be more attractive than the widely used exhaust
gas turbocharger, which is linked to truck and passenger car diesel engines.
In any case, supercharging via a mechanically powered displacement compressor makes sense
for small gasoline engines if the displacement compressors are further developed in view of
their natural boost pressure curve against engine speed, and their achievable pressure ratios and
efﬁciencies. Furthermore, another open problem of mechanical supercharging systems is the noise
emission.
All open challenges of mechanical supercharging could be effectively solved, e.g., by utilizing
a well developed screw-type compressor (Lysholm compressor). On the one hand, it can achieve
high pressure ratios, on the other (due to its high internal compression and its quasi-continuous
delivery) high total efﬁciencies (Fig.13.1a), and this at low noise levels.
Figure13.1b shows the rotor pair of such a compressor. Its success will depend on
whether such a precision charger can be produced with sufﬁcient durability, with small
tolerances, and at acceptable costs. With further development regarding cost and tolerances,
the so-called spiral charger (Fig.11.1) may indeed be a solution for future small supercharged
gasoline engines.
We do not yet know, whether the current Roots blowers will need a variable speed connection
to the engine, via a variable belt drive or at least a shift gear, to improve their boost pressure curve
against engine speed. This certainly will never be an inexpensive solution.
13.2.2 Exhaust gas turbochargers
As mentioned several times, the exhaust gas turbocharger is now applied for nearly 100% of the
market for all diesel engine sizes down to those for light trucks, i.e., to displacements of about
3–4 liters.
Its development continues in a way previously deemed impossible. The passenger car diesel
engine is now practically exclusively turbocharged, and only mass-produced gasoline engines, up
to now rather rarely turbocharged, await this development.

Fig. 13.3. Large engine vtg for natural gas operation [abb]
The further development of variable turbine geometry (vtg) will certainly play an important
role with regard to both its function and its cost. As an example, Fig.13.2 shows a low-cost sliding-
ring vtg design developed by 3K-Warner.
This is also true for medium-speed engines and slow-speed engines. Figure13.3 shows a vtg
charger for a medium-speed natural gas engine, and a two-stage vtg axial turbine of a large charger
is sketched in Fig.13.4.
A similarly important role will be played by compressor-related measures to increase the
pressure ratio with simultaneous extension of the usable map. For example, Fig.13.5 shows the
advances in possible maximum compressor pressure ratios from 1946 to 1990.
More advances will also be made regarding the permissible exhaust gas temperatures. Here,
ceramic turbine materials are promising. Figure13.6 shows a possible connection between a
ceramic turbine rotor with a metallic turbocharger shaft.
Sheet-metal turbine housings with small heat capacity are under development for the purposes
of reduced response times of charger and catalyst.
13.2.3 Supercharging systems and combinations
In the future, more speciﬁc charging systems will be utilized in order to even better satisfy the
differing requirements for the application of supercharging in truck and passenger car engines.

Register charging
Register charging is commonly used in slow-speed engines already. But it also could gain
signiﬁcance for truck applications if the vtg charger cannot meet the durability demands required
under these conditions. However, in this case new operating strategies have to be considered.
In vehicle applications, charger switching in the main operating range of the engine is difﬁcult
for safety reasons (power loss in critical driving situations). A possible switching strategy could
be that the start-up range is covered using only one charger – with much higher torque – and under
all other driving conditions two chargers are used. Furthermore, the operational speed range of an
engine can be extended with this charging system.
For modern 4-valve engine designs, in combination with variable valve control, it might be
desirable to provide a separate exhaust port branch for each valve to optimize the gasdynamic
conditions – twin-ﬂow and cylinder combinations – for both chargers.
13.2 Trends for individual supercharging systems
219
Two-stage controlled supercharging
Two-stage controlled high-pressure supercharging has at least the same chance for future success
as register charging. It can achieve not only very high boost pressures at low engine speeds but
also improved load response and – due to the higher possible air excess ﬁgures – reduced pollutant
emissions. Especially large high-speed engines can take advantage of this in the future, since in this
engine category already today highly developed and correspondingly expensive charging systems
are utilized.
Two-stage exhaust gas turbochargers
Currently, designs are under development which combine two-stage chargers in one housing,
powered by one turbine. This would result in signiﬁcant installation advantages.
Turbocompounding
Turbocompound operation is sporadically applied today for heavy-duty truck engines – i.e., a
smaller segment of the entire automotive powertrain market. However, its further implementation
strongly depends on the one hand on future fuel cost, as well as on further efﬁciency increases of
the ﬂow components, and on the other on future emission levels and reduction strategies, because
the negative pressure gradient between intake and exhaust manifold of a compound engine makes
exhaust gas recirculation much easier. Furthermore, at least in the truck sector, the rule of thumb
regarding the application of all these efﬁciency-increasing exhaust gas energy recovery systems is
that the additional cost must be amortized by the customer within one year. A further prospect can
be seen in single-stage compound turbocharger operation, which will be described below.
For slow-speed engines, compound operation is also of great signiﬁcance. Here, economy is the
decisive factor, i.e., the lowest possible operating costs, especially fuel costs. However, mechanical
solutions have recently been abandoned in favor of electrical energy recovery (i.e., the secondary
turbine directly powers a generator, efﬁciently feeding the electric supply system on board at low
price). A new problem, caused by the further increased efﬁciencies of the basic engine, has arisen:
When a secondary turbine is used, the remaining exhaust gas energy is too low to preheat the heavy
oil sufﬁciently.
Supporting the exhaust gas turbocharger
At present, much research is directed toward a signiﬁcant improvement and extension of the
functionality of turbocharging systems by supporting the exhaust gas turbocharger. Here, a
distinction must be made between applications, i.e., passenger car, truck, stationary engines and
slow-speed engines.
For applications in passenger cars, the primary goal is to eliminate the “turbolag” of
turbocharged engines which exists even when a vtg charger is used. Naturally, at start-up only
the aspirated torque of the basic engine is available, since boost pressure can only be generated
after an increase in the demand for torque, i.e., an increase in the amount of fuel injected into the
engine.
A possible solution could be an additional charger which can be inexpensively integrated into
the intake and charge air system. Electricity from an onboard battery would be sufﬁcient to power
such an auxiliary charger. It would operate for short periods only. At low engine speeds, as soon as
vehicle acceleration is demanded by the driver, the additional charger would be powered, thereby
increasing the boost pressure. Pressure ratios of about 1.4 to 1.6 would be sufﬁcient to double
220
Outlook and further developments

the start-up torque. Turbodyne/Honeywell was developing such a start-up system under the name
Turbopac (Fig.13.7).
Further advantages may be achieved with such a system during the cold-start and warm-up
phases of diesel and gasoline engines. It would preheat the intake air. In a gasoline engine this
could lead to a signiﬁcant reduction or even abandonment of start-up enrichment. In a diesel engine
it could result in improved cold-start behavior and possibly lead to a reduction of the compression
ratio necessary for cold starts. Thus, also reduced peak ﬁring pressures could be achieved during
normal operation.
For applications in trucks, the problem of start-up necessitates the use of engines with
sufﬁcient displacement to start on an incline with only the aspirating torque. Thus, an additional
charger could provide a signiﬁcantly improved start-up characteristic. But there are even further
interesting application aspects for trucks, supporting an additional drive mechanism for the
exhaust gas turbocharger which is in any event necessary. If the exhaust gas turbocharger can
be mechanically or electrically coupled to the total system in the entire load and speed range of the
engine, this will possibly improve its load response, as a single-stage compound operation, and its
engine braking behavior.
Independent of the exhaust gas energy available, the turbocharger is accelerated during positive
load steps by an electric motor – either arranged on the charger shaft or connected to it via a clutch –
to a speed which enables it to generate the boost pressure desired in the actual operating point (e.g.,
start-up of a fully loaded truck at an incline). The time during which this support is needed will
usually be very short, since once boost pressure is available, the turbine power increases rapidly
and can cover the power requirements of the compressor.
Besides utilizing an electric motor located on the turbocharger shaft as an additional drive
(also for the purpose of increasing the boost pressures in the low-speed range), in single-stage
compound operation this unit can be used also as a generator. Under all those operating conditions
in which, e.g., a waste gate is used to control the boost pressure, the charger speed (and thus the boost
pressure) can be reduced via the generator, and the recovered electric power can be fed back into the
onboard electric system. However, for this suitable controls, power electronics and energy storage
components are necessary. Further, the turbines utilized have to meet this additional requirement.
Even under the changed pressure–mass ﬂow conditions they must feature high efﬁciencies since
the turbocharger speed signiﬁcantly deviates from the freewheeling speed. Theoretically it would
also be possible to reroute the electrical energy back to the drivetrain, e.g., via an electric booster
motor or a crankshaft starter generator. The success of all such systems depends on the efﬁciencies
of the components, especially the electric components. Figure13.8 shows a possible layout for
such an electric compound system.

If the described self-sustaining electric charger drive is also used under engine braking
conditions, the engine braking power can be signiﬁcantly increased since a far higher airﬂow
through the engine is obtained. The airﬂow can be transferred into higher braking power, e.g., via a
constant throttle, as it is now utilized in mass production already. Further, the electric power of the
generator turns into additional braking power. Additional functions of such a system are feasible,
e.g., a preheating of the charge air at cold-start via prestart air circulation. A similar system may
also be designed mechanically, but this will not be further discussed here.
Mechanical additional charging
Systems combining a mechanical charger with an exhaust gas turbocharger have already been
introduced by DaimlerChrysler and Volvo for truck engines. Recently vw has introduced such a
system for its 1.4 liter tsi direct-injection gasoline engine; see Chap. 14.1 (Figs.14.22–14.24).
However, such combinations represent a very complex system and, possibly, may be less reliable
with two different charger designs. Therefore, for various reasons including cost, they will only be
used in special cases.
The situation is totally different for two-stroke engines. Especially in medium-speed and low-
speed engines, this combination of mechanical scavenging auxiliary supercharger and turbocharger
(Fig.14.59) is state of the art today.
13.3 Summary
Supercharging of reciprocating internal combustion engines has become established as the most
straightforward way to increase their power density and efﬁciency while also reducing their
pollutant emissions. It will also signiﬁcantly impact the gasoline engine market when more stringent
requirements for lower emissions, and at the same time for increased efﬁciency, are demanded by
society and politics. As soon as today’s minor disadvantages of exhaust gas turbocharging under
dynamic operation are eliminated, it will further promote a meaningful downsizing of engines
especially for highly dynamic vehicle applications.
14 Examples of supercharged production
engines
14.1 Supercharged gasoline engines
The history of supercharged gasoline engines started with automobile racing applications. As early
as in the 1920s, but especially in the 1930s, remarkable speciﬁc power output levels of about
120kW/l were achieved via mechanical supercharging of Auto-Union and Mercedes-Benz racing
engines.
As turbocharger technology advanced, it also was ﬁrst applied to racing engines. One of the
best-known examples is the legendary Porsche type 917. In 1975, Porsche introduced into mass
production a 2 liter, 4-cylinder engine with exhaust gas turbocharging for their model 924. The
K26 charger built by 3K-Warner (formerly kkk) was equipped with an integrated bypass valve
at the intake side; on the exhaust side the turbine mass ﬂow was controlled via an external waste
gate, as can be seen in Fig.14.1.
Following Porsche, in the 1970s, among others, Saab (2 liter, 4 cylinders), Audi, and bmw
introduced turbocharged engines. Figure14.2 shows a 5-cylinder engine of which the exhaust
manifold to the turbine warrants special mention. Due to the speciﬁc ignition sequence of the 5-
cylinder engine, this manifold has a triple-ﬂow design, in such a way that the routing of the exhaust
gas up to the ﬂange of the turbine is separate for cylinders 1, 2, and 5, and cylinders 3 and 4. As an
example of an early mass-produced 6-cylinder inline engine, the 3.2 liter bmw engine is shown in
Fig. 14.1

Fig.14.3. Besides turbocharging, its power density and torque were further increased by utilizing
charge air cooling and individual pulse charging manifolds, as can be seen in Fig.14.4.
In the 1990s, the trend towards turbocharged gasoline engines increased. By means of improved
turbocharger technology, the infamous turbo response lag could be largely eliminated, signiﬁcantly
improving its acceptance by the drivers. In the following, some examples of these modern
supercharged engines will be described in more detail.
In 1994, Audi introduced its 5-valve gasoline engine series in its 4-cylinder turbocharged
version (Fig.14.5). The most important characteristics and performance data are summarized in
TableA.1 in the appendix.
The charger unit consists of a turbocharger by 3K-Warner, series K03, and a downstream charge
air cooler. Boost pressure control is achieved with a waste gate integrated into the turbine housing.
A bypass control valve (short-circuit of the compressor cycle) is located on the compressor side,

assuring that at rapid load changes, when the engine throttle is suddenly closed, the compressor
does not operate beyond the surge limit.
Under steady state full-load conditions, this layout of the turbocharger reaches its maximum
boost pressure at about 1,750min−1. Correspondingly, beyond this engine speed range, the rated
torque of the engine, 210Nm (corresponding to about 15bar bmep), is available (Fig.14.6).
Due to its extreme engine compartment limitations, the mcc Smart passenger car requires
a very compact layout of the complete engine (Fig.14.7), especially its charger unit. In the
case of the turbocharged M160 3-cylinder engine, the solution was to integrate the turbine
housing into the exhaust gas manifold (Fig.14.8), as was shown before already by Opel in its
turbocharged 2-liter, 4-valve gasoline engine. By means of turbocharging, this engine with 0.66
liter displacement provides a torque of 80Nm above 2,000min−1. Considering the total engine
weight of 59kg, this engine, which is rated at 40kW, reaches a speciﬁc weight-to-power ratio of
1.48kg/kW.

The highest power densities were achieved in F1 racing, utilizing turbocharged 1.5 liter gasoline
engines. First they were used by Renault in actual races in 1977. The end of this development was
marked by the Honda-RA168E-engine, which won the F1 championship with 15 of 16 possible
victories during the last year of racing regulations allowing this engine type.
In this last year of F1 turbocharged engines, 1988, the boost pressure was limited to 2.5bar,
while in the year before a maximum pressure of 4bar was allowed. Power levels of about 740kW
could be achieved from 1.5 liter displacement, i.e., an impressive ﬁgure of 495kW/l displacement.
While the ﬁrst turbocharged F1 engines utilized a single charger, in 1979 Renault adopted
a bi-turbo arrangement, where each cylinder bank had its own turbocharger (Fig.14.9). At a
boost pressure of 2bar, the engine shown in Fig.14.9 generated a maximum power of 470kW
at 11,000min−1 rated speed in its version for the 1982/83 racing season.
The previously mentioned culmination of the development of F1 turbocharged engines is
represented by the example of the Honda-RA168E (Fig.14.10). The impressive torque and power

curves of these engines are shown in Fig.14.11, in the versions with 4 and with 2.5bar maximum

The maximum engine torque of 664Nm at 4bar boost pressure and the rated power output at
about 12,500min−1 are impressive. This corresponds to a speciﬁc value of 443Nm/l displacement.
14.1 Supercharged gasoline engines

The high quality of these engines is additionally reﬂected in their low fuel consumption, which is
in the range of 280–300g/kWh (in spite of the relatively high friction losses of racing engines due
to their high piston velocities at rated speed).
For these racing engines it became necessary to develop ceramic turbine rotors, which could
tolerate the high temperatures occurring under racing conditions. Further, rotors made of ceramic
materials have lower inertia and thus improved charger load response.
In 1993, Subaru introduced its 2 liter, ﬂat-4-cylinder engine in a version with register charging
at the Tokyo Motor Show. Along with its integrated charge air cooler, the engine represents a
very compact package with a power density of 92kW/l (Fig.14.12). The operating strategy of the

engine and charger unit is selected in such a way that up to about 2,500min−1 the ﬁrst stage alone
generates the boost pressure. Then the second turbocharger is accelerated to operating speed, and
above about 3,000min−1 the rated boost pressure of 1.8bar is generated with both turbochargers.
In this way, the peak torque of 310Nm is obtained at approximately 5,000min−1. Figure14.13
shows the three operating conditions of the register charging unit in corresponding diagrams.
As a high-power version, the legendary air-cooled ﬂat-6-cylinder of Porsche’s model 959
(Fig.14.14) was equipped with register turbocharging (see Sect.6.3). The impressive performance
data of this engine are also listed in the appendix. The speciﬁc power of this engine, 115.8kW/l,
underlines the high power potential of supercharged gasoline engines. The boost pressures
generated by the compressor are in the range of 1.9bar. By increasing the boost pressure, the
power was increased to 500kW for racing applications. The production engine, such as the racing
version, was equipped with a dry-sump lubrication system.
Daimler Benz’ M 119HL was also very successfully used in automobile racing. The engine was
based on the aluminum 5 liter V8 engine of the E- and S-class Mercedes Benz passenger car models.
By consistent advancement of the engine mechanics and the cooling system, plus the utilization
of the best charger components available at that time, a power level of 700kW and a torque of
more than 1,000Nm were obtained. By means of consistent ﬂow division for optimized pulse
exhaust gas turbocharging, selective ignition timing control, a ceramic high-performance turbine
and a magnesium compressor, i.e., a rotor assembly with minimized inertia, a very harmonic
torque rise could be achieved, with boost pressure response times of about 1s (Fig.14.15). At
255g/kWh, the low speciﬁc fuel consumption at rated power was unrivaled. Figure14.16 shows
the fuel consumption map, Fig.14.17 a view of the engine.
Supercharging via mechanically powered compressors was widely utilized in the early years
of engine development, especially for aircraft engines. In the mid-1990s, DaimlerChrysler again
applied this charging principle very successfully in its passenger car gasoline engine M111K
(Fig.14.18) for the C-class and SLK models, where the power of the basic engine was sufﬁcient
to cover wide ranges of actual driving conditions without applying the compressor. However, its
pollutant emissions (catalyst light-off) and its fuel economy were improved by the downsizing
effect – an aspirated engine of the same rated power would run at lower speciﬁc loads and,
thus, would have a higher speciﬁc fuel consumption. Mechanical charging can also provide boost

pressure with practically no time lag, which is demanded by the driver. This results in a driving
behavior comparable to a naturally aspirated engine. The torque curve against speed is ﬂat and does
not achieve the torque back-up levels and thus the engine elasticity of exhaust gas turbocharged
engines.
In the mid-1990s, Mazda too introduced a gasoline engine with mechanical supercharger, in
this case a screw-type charger (Fig.14.19). The engine was designated as a Miller-cycle engine,
which would correspond to an early closing of the inlet valves and charge cooling via expansion
in the cylinder down to bdc (see Sect.6.4). The designation is not completely accurate in this
case since the inlet valve was closed late, past bdc, during the compression stroke. This shortens
the effective compression stroke in comparison to the expansion and thus improves the internal
thermodynamic efﬁciency. To be correct, corresponding to its inventor this process control has to
be called a Late Atkinson cycle.
However, the low gas exchange efﬁciency (volumetric efﬁciency) of the engine had to be
compensated by higher charge air densities (high boost pressure and low charge air temperatures),
for which the screw-type charger utilized was the ideal unit. The engine combined a suitable boost
pressure control at full load with the relative extension of the expansion stroke. Compared to the
basic engine, this resulted in a power increase as well as improved fuel economy in the driving
cycle (part load; Fig.14.20).
Another interesting special design is Mazda’s 3-rotor Wankel engine with register charging.
Figure14.21 shows the schematic of the engine with the charger unit. In comparison to conventional
turbocharging, with the register charging design chosen, it was possible to improve the torque and
boost pressure behavior of this Wankel engine signiﬁcantly, in the lower speed range by up to 36%.
In order to further improve the load response of a turbocharged gasoline engine, in 2005vw
presented a 1.4 liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engine (Fig.14.22) with a combined mechanical and
turbocharging system which is shown in Fig.14.23. Thus, with the rather instantaneous boost
pressure buildup possible with the mechanical supercharger, the turbo lag is completely eliminated.

On the other hand, the turbocharger allows to achieve as high a power and torque output of
the engine as if the boost pressure would be provided by the mechanically driven compressor
(Fig.14.24) but, of course, without the typical fuel consumption penalty at high loads and speeds of
mechanically supercharged gasoline engines. The most important characteristics and performance
data are summarized in TableA.1 in the appendix.

In 2006, the ﬁrst gasoline engine with variable turbine geometry was introduced to the market
by Porsche. In the exhaust system of the 3.6 liter, ﬂat-6-cylinder engine (Fig.14.25), two vtg
turbochargers of 3K Warner (Fig.14.26) are integrated, which allow a reliable and durable operation

erated at low engine speeds by the turbochargers with the inlet vanes at closed position (Fig.14.27a),
torque output of the engine exceeds 600Nm already at an engine speed of 1,900min−1. Due to the
larger effective ﬂow area of the turbines at fully open inlet vane position (Fig.14.27b), the high
torque can be maintained close to rated speed of the engine ﬁnally leading to a rated power of
353kW. For further technical data of this engine it is referred to TableA.1 in the appendix.

14.2 Passenger car diesel engines
In the late 1970s, the trend towards supercharging passenger car diesel engines became apparent.
It was foreseeable that the speciﬁc power of naturally aspirated prechamber engines would not be
sufﬁcient in the medium term to cover the driving performance requirements of modern vehicles.
Accordingly, Daimler Benz equipped its 3.0 liter OM617 5-cylinder engine with exhaust gas
turbocharging. The performance data of this engine are summarized in the appendix. In comparison
to the naturally aspirated engine (59kW), the power was increased by 26kW. The turbocharged
engine, which was based on the naturally aspirated version, was equipped with a waste gate charger.
No charge air cooling was applied. For reasons of improved ﬂeet fuel economy, the engine was
ﬁrst introduced in the United States in S-class vehicles (W116). Figure14.28 shows a charger-side
view of the engine.
Subsequently, numerous turbocharged passenger car diesel engines were introduced into the
market. All of these utilized the prechamber combustion (idi) process. To further improve fuel
economy, the intense development of direct-injection (di) diesel engines started in the 1980s –

Supercharged production engines
with signiﬁcant involvement of avl – and in the 1990s this technology achieved a real market
breakthrough. Audi became the pioneer in this technology. In 1989 it introduced a 2.5 liter, 5-
cylinder engine which was the ﬁrst turbocharged passenger car mass production diesel engine
with di. By the end of the 1990s, in Europe the market share of supercharged passenger car diesel
engines had increased to nearly 25%, and in some countries of the European Community their share
in new vehicle registrations had reached 60% and more (Austria, Italy, France). In the following,
some of these modern di diesel engines with exhaust gas turbocharging will be discussed.
In 1998, bmw introduced its di 4-cylinder diesel engine with turbocharging (Fig.14.29). This
4-valve engine was the successor to the idi 2-valve model from 1994. At a rated power of 100kW
and a displacement of 1.95 liter, this was the ﬁrst passenger car di diesel engine to exhibit a speciﬁc
power density of more than 50kW/l (51.3kW/l). The technical data of this engine are summarized
in the appendix.
The power potential of this di diesel engine was impressively proven in endurance racing.
With modiﬁcations made to the basic series engine – valve timing (late closing of the intake
valves), combustion chamber (lower compression ratio), turbocharger (vtg charger for increased
mass ﬂow), reinforced crank drive – a race car with such an engine won the 24h race on the
Nuerburgring in 1998, defeating all other vehicles which were equipped with gasoline engines.
Besides its estimated power of 180kW and a maximum torque of about 400Nm, the low fuel
consumption of the engine (195g/kWh in its best operating point and 225g/kWh at rated power) –
resulting in fewer refueling stops in comparison to cars with gasoline engines – was the major
contributor to the victory in this endurance race.
While at ﬁrst the di of the fuel into the combustion chamber was performed by distributor
pumps, in the mid-1980s the development of a new generation of high-pressure fuel accumulator
injection systems (common rail) was initiated. Due to the inherent capability of widely inﬂuencing
the fuel injection process, improvements were possible regarding pollutant emissions and the
performance of di diesel engines. The ﬁrst passenger car engines with this technology were
introduced into series production in 1997 by Fiat with their 4- and 5-cylinder engine models
jtd. The technical data of the 5-cylinder version are summarized in the appendix.
Figure14.30 shows the layout both of the charger unit and that of the common-rail injection
system (maximum rail pressure of about 1,350bar). With this injection system, the EU3 exhaust
gas standards mandated by law could be met, and through the use of pilot-injection the combustion
noise was signiﬁcantly reduced – in the low-speed range by up to 8dB(A). The comfort gained by
these measures clearly increased the attractiveness of these engines for passenger car applications.

In 1997, Audi was the ﬁrst with its V6 turbocharged 4-valve engine to introduce a passenger car
di diesel V-engine into the market. In 1999, the Audi 8-cylinder V-engine with common rail and
vtg bi-turbocharging followed. This engine is shown in Fig.14.31. The extremely compact exhaust
gas system including both chargers is shown in Fig.14.32. On the air side, charge air cooling is
integrated into the V of the engine (Fig.14.33). In combination with the good fuel preparation by
the common-rail injection system, the engine features high torque at very low speeds and a high
power density (Fig.14.34), but also fulﬁlled the stringent EU3 exhaust emission limits. Due to
a careful selection of materials and production processes, a very low engine weight is achieved.
Further to aluminum cylinder heads, crankcase, and cylinder block are produced in ggv thin-wall
casting, allowing peak pressures of up to 160bar. This explains the high speciﬁc fuel economy of
the engine, despite the combustion controls required for compliance with EU3 emission standards.

In 1999, for the ﬁrst time a series production car (vw Lupo tdi) was introduced with a fuel
consumptionoflessthan3liter/100km(2.99liter/100km)inthe nedc.Thepowertrainconsistedof
a 3-cylinder, 1.2 liter di diesel engine with vtg turbocharger, and a drivetrain especially developed
for this application (automated manual transmission and engine deactivation during start-stop
operation). Here, the variable-geometry turbine of the Garrett VNT12 charger enables high torque
at low speeds, in such a way that – in combination with the automated manual transmission – the
engine operating points in the driving cycle can be shifted into the engine map range with the best
fuel economy. Figure14.35 shows a longitudinal and a cross section of the engine. In addition to its
innovative all-aluminum engine design, the connection between cylinder head and main bearing
assembly is assured by integrated tie rods to allow the high ignition pressure forces. Its high-
pressure injection system by cam-controlled unit injector elements marked the introduction of a

new technology in passenger car diesel engines. Since this system can achieve injection pressures
exceeding 2,000bar, the combustion can be tuned to result not only in low fuel consumption but
also in very low exhaust gas emissions (in compliance with EU3 and D4 standards).
The most important technical data of the engine are summarized in the appendix. To achieve
the engine characteristics mentioned, besides a conventional air-to-air charge air cooling system
the engine is equipped with a water-cooled exhaust gas recirculation system. The combination of
all these measures resulted in a reduction of the CO2 emissions in the nedc driving cycle down to
81g/km (Lupo 870kg version).
One of the most modern representatives of supercharged passenger car diesel engines is the
6-cylinder inline di diesel engine OM613 by DaimlerChrysler, the top engine of a series with 4-,
5-, and 6-cylinder engines. It is equipped with a common-rail injection system, vtg exhaust gas
turbocharger, air-to-air charge air cooling, controlled and cooled exhaust gas recirculation, and
a controlled ﬂap valve in the intake port which allows the charge swirl level to be adjusted for
different map-speciﬁc requirements. It represents the state of the art of passenger car diesel engine
development. Figure14.36 shows a charger-side view of the engine.
A further development stage in turbocharging technology was achieved when bmw introduced
its V8 di diesel engine (Fig.14.37) in which the turbine inlet blade position of the vtg chargers is
controlled by electric stepping motors (Fig.14.38). With this technology, both vtg chargers (one
charger for each cylinder row) can be reliably held within the stable compressor map area in the
total engine operating range – especially under transient conditions and in the lower speed range –
resulting in an improved utilization of the compressor map and allowing operation close to the
dynamic surge limit.
In 2005, a combination of two-stage and register turbocharging of a passenger car diesel engine
was also introduced by bmw in mass production (Fig.14.39). In this case, a larger compressor
of the low-pressure stage is followed downstream by a smaller compressor of the high-pressure
turbocharger (Fig.14.40).
In order to integrate a high-pressure compressor small enough for best low end torque but still
not leading to any swallowing limitation in the entire engine air mass ﬂow range, the corresponding
compressor can be bypassed at higher loads. Because of the comparatively small inertia of the
high-pressure stage (as the only turbocharger mainly active in such operation conditions), the

boost pressure can be built up faster than with a conventional single-stage turbocharging system.
On the other hand, at higher engine speeds and loads, the high-pressure turbine can be partly
bypassed and, thus, the boost pressure controlled without opening a waste gate. Only at very high
loads, i.e., near rated power, also the waste gate of the low-pressure turbine has to be opened to
limit the boost pressure. The different operating modes of this advanced turbocharging system are
summarized in Fig.14.41. Further, the main engine geometry and performance data are listed in
TableA.1.
Recently, two-stage turbocharging is also utilized to introduce new alternative diesel
combustionprocessesforpassengercarapplications.Thesecombustionprocessesrequireparticular
cylinder charge properties and, thus, higher boost pressures also at part-load operation [133].
Again, with the help of a two-stage quasi-register turbocharging system, a smaller “high-pressure”
turbocharger can generate such higher boost pressures already at mid-speed part-load operation.

Supercharged production engines
Fig. 14.42. View of the two-stroke di diesel engine by avl, with
combined supercharging system
An engine with such a combination of a two-stage turbocharging system with an alternative diesel
combustionprocesswaspresentedbyavlin2005.Theadvantageofthistechnologycombinationis
a simultaneous reduction of engine-out emissions (−85% of NOx and −90% of particle emissions
measured in the nedc compared with an engine with a conventional combustion system), due
to the extended operation range of the engine with alternative combustion and very high power
density.
Two-stroke engines also represent a logical application area for supercharging technology.
They are used either if simple and low-cost engines are required (e.g., motorcycles) or if extreme
power density has to be achieved at lowest weight (e.g., motorcycle racing). In the early years of
the automobile, two-stroke engines were utilized due to their power density and their smoothness
(double ﬁring sequence as compared with the four-stroke engine). In 1996, avl introduced a
two-stroke di diesel engine with combined super- and turbocharging (Fig.14.42). The operating
behavior and the charging technology of this engine was discussed in more detail in Sect.6.6.6.
The operating data achieved with this engine and the most important engine characteristics are
listed in the appendix.
By combining the advantages of uniﬂow scavenging (with the best efﬁciency of all scavenging
processes) with the concept of combined charging (low scavenging losses and high charge density
due to turbine backpressure), it was possible to achieve maximum mean effective pressures of
11bar. This corresponds to a four-stroke mean effective pressure of 22bar. The engine was used
as an experimental engine for the development of the charging system as well as of a novel two-
stroke uniﬂow scavenging process which allows the cylinder spacing to be similar to that of a
four-stroke engine by avoiding scavenging ports between the cylinders. A similar engine was
shown by Daihatsu at the Frankfurt Automobile Exhibition in 1999 as a prototype.
As for gasoline engines (Sect.14.2), DaimlerChrysler also published results of tests comparing
mechanical charging and turbocharging using a 2.5 liter diesel engine. In addition to the charging
system, the advantages and disadvantages of Roots and spiral chargers were investigated on the
engine. The spiral charger exhibits the advantages of low inertia and better efﬁciencies at higher
compression ratios (Fig.14.43).
In the part-load range, especially relevant for passenger car engines, the conditions are reversed,
resulting in lower part-load fuel consumption with the Roots blower due to the lower driving power
required (Fig.14.44). However, the overwhelming majority of today’s diesel engines are designed

in such a way that they are mainly operated with active turbocharging, so that the latter conclusion
may not be generalized.
As a last example of supercharged passenger car diesel engines, we will consider the idi
diesel engine with pressure-wave charging utilized in the Mazda model 626 (Fig.14.45). This

Supercharged production engines
supercharged swirl-chamber diesel engine, which was developed from a former naturally aspirated
version and whose idi technology at the time of its market introduction in 1987 was state of the
art, gave the Mazda 626 model a driving performance comparable to their 2.0 liter dohc gasoline
engine. The fuel consumption was about 20% lower with the Comprex diesel engine, as compared
with the gasoline version.
Figure14.46 shows the exhaust gas carrying components of the engine. Since the Comprex
charging system is especially sensitive to exhaust gas backpressure, the dimensions of the exhaust
gas system have to be selected correspondingly large (manifold diameter and lowest mufﬂer
pressure loss). This can be seen in Fig.14.46. The performance data of this engine are summarized
in the appendix.
Actually, the minimum fuel consumption shown in TableA.1 underlines the signiﬁcant
disadvantage of prechamber engines in comparison to di diesel engines.
14.3 Truck diesel engines
One of the ﬁrst mass-produced supercharged engines was the diesel engine D1 KL by Adolph
Saurer, equipped with a screw-type charger (Fig.14.47), which was later superceded by the exhaust
gas turbocharged engine D1 KT (Fig.14.48).
In the United States, for a very long time Detroit Diesel Corporation two-stroke engines were
utilized for trucks and buses, such as the 8V-92T model with exhaust gas turbocharger and upstream
mechanical Roots blower. Figure14.49 shows the view of the engine. More stringent requirements
with regard to exhaust emissions and the necessity to improve the engine’s fuel economy made
these engines obsolete.
Some examples of modern truck engines will be presented now. The ﬁrst example is the D 2876
LF by MAN, a water-cooled inline 6-cylinder engine with 4-valve cylinder head, with a maximum
power of about 340kW at 1,700–1,900min−1 and a maximum torque of 2,100Nm between 900
and 1,300min−1. Figure14.50 shows a view of this engine.

At the end of the 1990s, DaimlerChrysler developed their new series 900, with inline 4- and
6-cylinder engines rated between 90 and 230kW at 2,300–2,500min−1, for applications in light-
duty and medium-duty trucks. The rated power of the engine OM 904 (Fig.14.48a) is 90–125kW
at 2,300min−1, its maximum torque is 470–660Nm between 1,200 and 1,500min−1. The OM906
model has a rated power of 170–230kW at 2,300min−1 and a maximum torque of 810 to 1,300Nm
at 1,200min−1.
The D12C 460 by Volvo (Fig.14.52) is a 6-cylinder inline engine with 4 valves, overhead
camshaft, and fuel unit injectors. The version shown is rated at 340kW at 1,800min−1. Its maximum

With the layout shown in Fig.14.53 (the charger unit with compound turbine is shown in
Fig.14.54), the R124-470 engine by Scania is rated at 346kW at 1,900min−1. Its maximum torque
is 2,200Nm in the speed range between 1,050 and 1,350min−1. With help of the compound turbine
technology, the efﬁciency of the engine increased in its best point from 44 to 47%.
As early as 1991, Daimler Benz introduced such a compound engine on the basis of its V8
version of the model series OM440. Fuel economy improvements of around 5% were achieved in
the rated power range, but this improvement was only possible in combination with an insulation
of the exhaust gas manifolds [83].
All turbocompound engines with mechanical energy recovery need a step-down gear.
Figure14.55 shows a possible design, including an integrated secondary turbine with vtg.

Figure14.56showsanexampleofcombinedchargingonatruckengine,the10.9liter,V6engine
OM441 LA by Daimler Benz. The charger unit consists of a conventional turbocharger combined
with a mechanically powered Roots blower. Up to a speed of 1,250min−1, the mechanical charger
assists in supplying the engine with air. At higher speeds, the mechanical charger is bypassed
and the turbocharger alone provides the charge air for the engine. With such combined charging
systems, signiﬁcant increases in mean effective pressures can be achieved in the lower speed range
(Fig.14.57), as well as signiﬁcant improvements in transient response.
14.4 Aircraft engines
Nowadays, reciprocating piston combustion engines are only utilized in small aircraft. One of the
most frequently used engines is the GSO-480 engine by Lycoming, a ﬂat-6-cylinder engine with
mechanically powered turbo compressor (Fig.14.58). The engine generates a takeoff power of
250kW at 3,400min−1, has a continuous rating of 235kW at 3,200min−1 and weighs 225kg.
In 1988, Porsche also received ﬂight certiﬁcation for an exhaust gas turbocharged ﬂat-6-cylinder
engine, the PFM 3200. The engine was rated at a takeoff power of 180kW at 5,300/2,343min−1
engine/propeller speed. Figure14.59 shows a view of this – at that time most advanced – small
aircraft engine.
14.5 High-performance high-speed engines (locomotive and ship engines)
High-speed diesel engines (nmax ≈800–2,000min−1) for rail vehicles, fast ships, and military
applications were formerly mainly two-stroke engines. The high power densities necessary for
these applications demand supercharging for practically all of them. Since four-stroke engines
are better suited for supercharging, the fraction of two-stroke engines has signiﬁcantly declined
recently. In the speed range of the engines discussed in this chapter, the two-stroke cycle shows no

advantage either in speciﬁc power per cylinder or in its installed size or weight. Regarding thermal
engine loads, the four-stroke cycle is clearly superior.
Therefore, only one two-stroke engine example, the model 16-645 E5 of the gm Electro-
Motive Division, LaGrange, Illinois, will be described. For a long time, this engine dominated
the American locomotive market. It is equipped with a charging system described in Sect.7.4.4
(Fig.7.12), powering the exhaust gas turbocharger from the engine crankshaft via a transmission
and a freewheel clutch. The engine is rated at about 2,500kW at 900min−1, its cylinder dimensions
are 230mm bore and 255mm stroke. Figure14.60 shows a view of the engine.
Today, the majority of engines are highly supercharged four-stroke engines, e.g., the model V
538 TB by mtu. mtu produces this model as a series of 12-, 16-, and 20-cylinder engines, with
a bore of 185mm and a stroke of 200mm. A special feature is the installation of the exhaust gas
turbochargers in the V of the engine with vertical orientation of the charger shaft. This results in
especially short exhaust manifolds with small volumes and, thus, favorable conditions for pulse
turbocharging. The 16-cylinder version is rated at 3,000kW at 1,900min−1. Figure14.61 shows a
view of the engine with the vertically arranged chargers.

Supercharged production engines
Fig. 14.63. Cross section of the mtu engine 1163 with two-stage
register charging
The two engines of the V 956/1163 series by mtu have a common bore of 230mm, but different
strokes of 230 and 280mm, i.e., individual cylinder displacements of 9.56 and 11.63 liter/cylinder,
which is expressed in their model names. Figure14.62 shows the short-stroke 20 V 956 TB type,
which is rated as a ship engine at 4,900kW at 1,500min−1, corresponding to a mean effective
pressure of 20.5 bar and 245kW power per cylinder.
Figure14.63 shows a cross section of the longer-stroke V 1163 model. In this view, the compact
layout of the high- and low-pressure exhaust gas turbochargers (two-stage register charging) can
be seen. The engine generates 370kW per cylinder at 1,300min−1, which corresponds to a very
high mean effective pressure of 29.5 bar. With its maximum number of 20 cylinders, this engine
series can provide up to 7,400kW net power.
14.6 Medium-speed engines (gas and heavy-oil operation)
For stationary and marine applications, medium-speed engines (n ≈200–800 min−1) cover a wide
speed and power spectrum. The engine layouts for this sector are correspondingly diversiﬁed. In
the order of increasing power output per cylinder, the following engines are mentioned as typical
examples.
The man b&w series 32/40 (320mm bore, 400mm stroke) covers inline and V engines, all of
which generate the same power per cylinder, i.e., 440kW at 720–750min−1. Figure14.64 shows a
cross section of the V engine.
The mak M552AK engine is a good example of the design complexities necessary for the
exhaust system to achieve optimum pulse turbocharging. With a bore of 450mm and a stroke

folds suited for pulse turbocharging. Since the charge air manifolds are also located inside the

upper end for medium-speed engines. The layout of its exhaust system emphasizes its
constant-pressure turbocharging process. Its speciﬁc power is rated at 885kW per cylinder
at 500min−1.
The semt-Pielstick PC4-570 engine (Fig.14.67) has a bore of 570mm and a stroke of 620mm.
At 400min−1, it generates 1,100kW per cylinder. This corresponds to the very high mean effective
pressure of about 21bar, which certainly can also be traced back to its effective exhaust system
layout for optimum pulse turbocharging.
As an example of the fact that medium-speed engines are available in four-stroke and in two-
stroke designs, the two man engine models KV 45/66 and DZ 53/76 can be mentioned. The
KV 45/66 (Fig.14.68a) represents a four-stroke engine with simple layout, while the DZ 53/76
(Fig.14.68b) shows the complexity of a double-acting, loop-scavenged two-stroke engine with
Roots type mechanical scavenging blower and constant-pressure turbocharging.
14.7 Slow-speed engines (stationary and ship engines)
Today, slow-speed engines (n ≈60–150 min−1) are exclusively utilized for electric energy
generation or as primary ship engines with direct propeller connection. For various reasons, they
are all two-stroke engines, particularly due to their better power density and the fuel used. These
are all operated with heavy oil, whose quality is constantly deteriorating. A two-stroke cross-head
engine can tolerate such bad fuel qualities better than a four-stroke engine.

253
Further, for reasons of efﬁciency and thus fuel economy, very low engine speeds, down to about
60min−1, are required for direct drives of today’s ship propellers which can only be achieved by
two-stroke engines. The development trends which have been observed lately show continually
increasing stroke lengths, with stroke-to-bore ratios greater than 4, and continually higher boost
pressures with simultaneously increasing mean effective pressures.
Figure14.69 shows the development trends from 1978 to 1992 for the most important engine
parameters of the slow-speed engines by New Sulzer. The astonishing increase in peak ﬁring
pressures up to 180 bar is necessary for the achievement of best fuel economy.
In the mid-1960s, the man KZ 105/180 engine was the state of the art for loop-scavenged two-
stroke engines. With a bore of 1,050mm it had the largest piston diameter ever. Along with its stroke
of 1,800mm it generated 2,950kW per cylinder. Figure14.70 shows the cross section of this engine.

Supercharged production engines
Mitsubishi’s VEC 52/105 engine was a uniﬂow scavenged two-stroke engine with three exhaust
valves. It featured two-stage charging, with pulse turbocharging of the high-pressure turbine.
Figure6.3 shows the cross section of this engine, which generated about 1,000kW power per
cylinder at 175min−1. After that, the development trend clearly shifted to uniﬂow scavenged long-
stroke engines with a centrally located exhaust valve (for the most part hydraulically actuated) and
highly efﬁcient constant-pressure turbocharging.
The current state of the art is shown by the RT 84 T engine by New Sulzer. It is a uniﬂow
scavenged cross-head two-stroke engine with a central, hydraulically actuated turbolator-exhaust
valve. Timing and lift of the valve can be varied (variable exhaust closing). In combination
with variable injection timing, very good part-load behavior is achieved at best fuel economy.
Figure14.71 shows a cross section of this engine with its very clear design.
Figure14.72a shows the hydraulic valve actuation system, with the arrangement for variable
lift and timing adjustment. The effects of an adjustment of valve lift and timing (variable exhaust
valve closing) on the cylinder pressure curve is summarized in Fig.14.72b. Finally, the achievable
engine performance data both with and without variable injection timing and variable exhaust valve
closing described above are plotted in Fig.14.73.
As a last example for a very particular layout of a powertrain with turbocharged internal
combustion engines, Fig.14.74 shows the compound system of the vessel Fritz Heckert developed
by mtu, consisting of 6 free-piston gas generators with integrated piston scavenging and charge
pumps which are providing the hot gas for the two power turbines. Each of the turbines were acting
via a transmission on one propeller shaft. Additionally two main diesel engines could be connected
to the propeller shaft via an electromagnetic clutch.
