e feel satisfied in presenting the new edition of
this popular treatise. The favourable and warm
reception which the previous editions and reprints
of this book have enjoyed all over India and abroad, is a
matter of great satisfaction for us.
The present multicolour edition has been thoroughly
revised and brought up-to-date. Multicolour pictures have
been added to enhance the content value and to give the
students an idea of what he will be dealing in reality, and to
bridge the gap between theory and practice. This book has
already been included in the ‘Suggested Reading’ for the
A.M.I.E. (India) examinations. The mistakes which had
crept in, have been eliminated. We wish to express our
sincere thanks to numerous professors and students, both
at home and abroad, for sending their valuable suggestions
and recommending the book to their students and friends.
We hope, that they will continue to patronise this book in the
future also.
Our grateful thanks are due to the Editorial staff of
S. Chand & Company Ltd., especially to Mr. E.J. Jawahardatham
and Mr. Rupesh Gupta, for their help in conversion of the
book into multicolour edition and  Mr. Pradeep Kr. Joshi for
Designing & Layouting of this book.
Any errors, omissions and suggestions, for the improvement
of this volume brought to our notice, will be thankfully
acknowledged and incorporated in the next edition.

Preface to the
First Edition
W
e take an opportunity to present this standard treatise
entitled as ‘A TEXTBOOK OF MACHINE DESIGN’
to the students of Degree, Diploma and A.M.I.E.
(India) classes in M.K.S. and S.I. units. The objective of this
book is to present the subject matter in a most concise,
compact, to the point and lucid manner.
While writing the book, we have continuously kept in mind
the examination requirement of the students preparing for
U.P.S.C. (Engg. Services) and A.M.I.E. (India) examinations.
In order to make this volume more useful for them, complete
solutions of their examination papers upto 1977 have also been
included. Every care has been taken to make this treatise as
self-explanatory as possible. The subject matter has been
amply illustrated by incorporating a good number of solved,
unsolved and well graded examples of almost every variety.
Most of these examples are taken from the recent examination
papers of Indian and foreign universities as well as professional
examining bodies, to make the students familiar with the type
of questions, usually, set in their examinations. At the end of
each chapter, a few exercises have been added for the students
to solve them independently. Answers to these problems have
been provided, but it is too much to hope that these are entirely
free from errors. In short, it is earnestly hoped that the book
will earn appreciation of all the teachers and students alike.
Although every care has been taken to check mistakes
and misprints, yet it is difficult to claim perfection. Any errors,
omissions and suggestions for the improvement of this treatise,
brought to our notice, will be thankfully acknowledged and
incorporated in the next edition.

Definition
The subject Machine Design is the creation of new
and better machines and improving the existing ones. A
new or better machine is one which is more economical in
the overall cost of production and operation. The process
of design is a long and time consuming one. From the study
of existing ideas, a new idea has to be conceived. The idea
is then studied keeping in mind its commercial success and
given shape and form in the form of drawings. In the
preparation of these drawings, care must be taken of the
availability of resources in money, in men and in materials
required for the successful completion of the new idea into
an actual reality. In designing a machine component, it is
necessary to have a good knowledge of many subjects such
as Mathematics, Engineering Mechanics, Strength of
Materials, Theory of Machines, Workshop Processes and
Engineering Drawing.

Classifications of Machine Design
The machine design may be classified as follows :
1. Adaptive design. In most cases, the designer’s work is concerned with adaptation of existing
designs. This type of design needs no special knowledge or skill and can be attempted by designers of
ordinary technical training. The designer only makes minor alternation or modification in the existing
designs of the product.
2. Development design. This type of design needs considerable scientific training and design
ability in order to modify the existing designs into a new idea by adopting a new material or different
method of manufacture. In this case, though the designer starts from the existing design, but the final
product may differ quite markedly from the original product.
3. New design. This type of design needs lot of research, technical ability and creative think-
ing. Only those designers who have personal qualities of a sufficiently high order can take up the
work of a new design.
The designs, depending upon the methods used, may be classified as follows :
(a)
Rational design. This type of  design depends upon mathematical formulae of principle of
mechanics.
(b)
Empirical design. This type of design depends upon empirical formulae based on the practice
and past experience.
(c)
Industrial design. This type of design depends upon the production aspects to manufacture
any machine component in the industry.
(d)
Optimum design. It is the best design for the given objective function under the specified
constraints. It may be achieved by minimising the undesirable effects.
(e)
System design. It is the design of any complex mechanical system like a motor car.
(f)
Element design. It is the design of any element of the mechanical system like piston,
crankshaft, connecting rod, etc.
(g)
Computer aided design. This type of design depends upon the use of computer systems to
assist in the creation, modification, analysis and optimisation of a design.
1.3
General Considerations in Machine Design
Following are the general considerations in designing a machine component :
1. Type of load and stresses caused by the load. The load, on a machine component, may act
in several ways due to which the internal stresses are set up. The various types of load and stresses are
discussed in chapters 4 and 5.
2. Motion of the parts or kinematics of the machine. The successful operation of any ma-
chine depends largely upon the simplest arrangement of the parts which will give the motion required.
The motion of the parts may be :
(a) Rectilinear motion which includes unidirectional and reciprocating motions.
(b) Curvilinear motion which includes rotary, oscillatory and simple harmonic.
(c) Constant velocity.
(d)  Constant or variable acceleration.
3. Selection of materials. It is essential that a designer should have a thorough knowledge of
the properties of the materials and their behaviour under working conditions. Some of the important
characteristics of materials are : strength, durability, flexibility, weight, resistance to heat and corro-
sion, ability to cast, welded or hardened, machinability, electrical conductivity, etc. The various types
of engineering materials and their properties are discussed in chapter 2.

Introduction     3
4. Form and size of the parts. The form and size are based on judgement. The smallest prac-
ticable cross-section may be used, but it may be checked that the stresses induced in the designed
cross-section are reasonably safe. In order to design any machine part for form and size, it is neces-
sary to know the forces which the part must sustain. It is also important to anticipate any suddenly
applied or impact load which may cause failure.
5. Frictional resistance and lubrication. There is always a loss of power due to frictional
resistance and it should be noted that the friction of starting is higher than that of running friction. It
is, therefore, essential that a careful attention must be given to the matter of lubrication of all surfaces
which move in contact with others, whether in rotating, sliding, or rolling bearings.
6. Convenient and economical features. In designing, the operating features of the machine
should be carefully studied. The starting, controlling and stopping levers should be located on the
basis of convenient handling. The adjustment for wear must be provided employing the various take-
up devices and arranging them so that the alignment of parts is preserved. If parts are to be changed
for different products or replaced on account of wear or breakage, easy access should be provided
and the necessity of removing other parts to accomplish this should be avoided if possible.
The economical operation of a machine which is to be used for production, or for the processing
of material should be studied, in order to learn whether it has the maximum capacity consistent with
the production of good work.
7. Use of standard parts. The
use of standard parts is closely related
to cost, because the cost of standard
or stock parts is only a fraction of the
cost of similar parts made to order.
The standard or stock parts
should be used whenever possible ;
parts for which patterns are already
in existence such as gears, pulleys and
bearings and parts which may be
selected from regular shop stock such
as screws, nuts and pins. Bolts and
studs should be as few as possible to
avoid the delay caused by changing
drills, reamers and taps and also to
decrease the number of wrenches required.
8. Safety of operation. Some machines are dangerous to operate, especially those which are
speeded up to insure production at a maximum rate. Therefore, any moving part of a machine which
is within the zone of a worker is considered an accident hazard and may be the cause of an injury. It
is, therefore, necessary that a designer should always provide safety devices for the safety of the
operator. The safety appliances should in no way interfere with operation of the machine.
9. Workshop facilities. A design engineer should be familiar with the limitations of his
employer’s workshop, in order to avoid the necessity of having work done in some other workshop.
It is sometimes necessary to plan and supervise the workshop operations and to draft methods for
casting, handling and machining special parts.
10. Number of machines to be manufactured. The number of articles or machines to be manu-
factured affects the design in a number of ways. The engineering and shop costs which are called
fixed charges or overhead expenses are distributed over the number of articles to be manufactured. If
only a few articles are to be made, extra expenses are not justified unless the machine is large or of
some special design. An order calling for small number of the product will not permit any undue
Design considerations play important role in the successful
production of machines.

expense in the workshop processes, so that the designer should restrict his specification to standard
parts as much as possible.
11. Cost of construction. The cost of construction of an article is the most important consideration
involved in design. In some cases, it is quite possible that the high cost of an article may immediately
bar it from further considerations. If an article has been invented and tests of hand made samples have
shown that it has commercial value, it is then possible to justify the expenditure of a considerable sum
of money in the design and development of automatic machines to produce the article, especially if it
can be sold in large numbers. The aim
of design engineer under all
conditions, should be to reduce the
manufacturing cost to the minimum.
12. 
Assembling. 
Every
machine or structure must be
assembled as a unit before it can
function. Large units must often be
assembled in the shop, tested and
then taken to be transported to their
place of service. The final location
of any machine is important and the
design engineer must anticipate the
exact location and the local facilities
for erection.
1.4
General Procedure in Machine Design
In designing a machine component, there is no rigid rule. The
problem may be attempted in several ways. However, the general
procedure to solve a design problem is as follows :
1. Recognition of need. First of all, make a complete statement
of the problem, indicating the need, aim or purpose for which the
machine is to be designed.
2. Synthesis (Mechanisms). Select the possible mechanism or
group of mechanisms which will give the desired motion.
3. Analysis of forces. Find the forces acting on each member
of the machine and the energy transmitted by each member.
4. Material selection. Select the material best suited for each
member of the machine.
5. Design of elements (Size and Stresses). Find the size of
each member of the machine by considering the force acting on the
member and the permissible stresses for the material used. It should
be kept in mind that each member should not deflect or deform than
the permissible limit.
6. Modification. Modify the size of the member to agree with
the past experience and judgment to facilitate manufacture. The
modification may also be necessary by consideration of manufacturing
to reduce overall cost.
7. Detailed drawing. Draw the detailed drawing of each component and the assembly of the
machine with complete specification for the manufacturing processes suggested.
8. Production. The component, as per the drawing, is manufactured in the workshop.
The flow chart for the general procedure in machine design is shown in Fig. 1.1.

Note : When there are number of components in the market having the same qualities of efficiency, durability
and cost, then the customer will naturally attract towards the most appealing product. The aesthetic and
ergonomics are very important features which gives grace and lustre to product and dominates the market.
1.5
Fundamental Units
The measurement of physical quantities is one of the most important operations in engineering.
Every quantity is measured in terms of some arbitrary, but internationally accepted units, called
fundamental units.
1.6
Derived Units
Some units are expressed in terms of other units, which are derived from fundamental units, are
known as derived units e.g. the unit of area, velocity, acceleration, pressure, etc.
1.7
System of Units
There are only four systems of units, which are commonly used and universally recognised.
These are known as :
1. C.G.S. units, 2. F.P.S. units, 3. M.K.S. units, and 4. S.I. units.
Since the present course of studies are conducted in S.I. system of units, therefore, we shall
discuss this system of unit only.
1.8
S.I. Units (International System of Units)
The 11th General Conference* of Weights and Measures have  recommended a unified and
systematically constituted system of fundamental and derived units for international use. This system
is now being used in many countries. In India, the standards of Weights and Measures Act 1956 (vide
which we switched over to M.K.S. units) has been revised to recognise all the S.I. units in industry
and commerce.
In this system of units, there are seven fundamental units and two supplementary units, which
cover the entire field of science and engineering. These units are shown in Table 1.1

It is known as General Conference of Weights and Measures (G.C.W.M). It is an international
organisation of which most of the advanced and developing countries (including India) are members.
The conference has been entrusted with the task of prescribing definitions for various units of weights
and measures, which are the very basics of science and technology today.

corresponding to the transition between the levels 2 p10 and 5 d5 of the Krypton– 86 atom.

iridium alloy) of the kilogram, kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sevres
near Paris.

to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium – 133 atom.
1.12 Presentation of Units and their Values
The frequent changes in the present day life are facilitated by an international body known as
International Standard Organisation (ISO) which makes recommendations regarding international
standard procedures. The implementation of lSO recommendations, in a country, is assisted by its
organisation appointed for the purpose. In India, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), has been created
for this purpose. We have already discussed that the fundamental units in S.I. units for length, mass
and time is metre, kilogram and second respectively. But in actual practice, it is not necessary to
express all  lengths in metres, all masses in kilograms and all times in seconds. We shall, sometimes,
use the convenient units, which are multiples or divisions of our basic units in tens. As a typical
example, although the metre is the unit of length, yet a smaller length of one-thousandth of a metre
proves to be more convenient unit, especially in the dimensioning of drawings. Such convenient units

is given in the following table :

1.13 Rules for S.I. Units
The eleventh General Conference of Weights and Measures recommended only the fundamen-
tal and derived units of S.I. units. But it did not elaborate the rules for the usage of the units. Later on
many scientists and engineers held a number of meetings for the style and usage of S.I. units. Some of
the decisions of the meeting are :
1. For numbers having five or more digits, the digits should be placed in groups of three separated
by spaces (instead of commas)** counting both to the left and right of the decimal point.
2. In a four*** digit number, the space is not required unless the four digit number is used in a
column of numbers with five or more digits.
3. A dash is to be used to separate units that are multiplied together. For example, newton ×
metre is written as N-m. It should not be confused with mN, which stands for milli newton.
4. Plurals are never used with symbols. For example, metre or metres are written as m.
5. All symbols are written in small letters except the symbol derived from the proper names.
For example, N for newton and W for watt.
6. The units with names of the scientists should not start with capital letter when written in full.
For example, 90 newton and not 90 Newton.
At the time of writing this book, the authors sought the advice of various international authori-
ties, regarding the use of units and their values. Keeping in view the international reputation of the
authors, as well as international popularity of their books, it was decided to present **** units and
*
These prefixes are generally becoming obsolete, probably due to possible confusion. Moreover it is becoming
a conventional practice to use only those power of ten which conform to 103x, where x is a positive or negative
whole number.
**
In certain countries, comma is still used as the decimal mark
*** In certain countries, a space is used even in a four digit number.
****In some of the question papers of the universities and other examining bodies standard values are not used.
The authors have tried to avoid such questions in the text of the book. However, at certain places the
questions with sub-standard values have to be included, keeping in view the merits of the question from the
reader’s angle.

The above mentioned figures are meant for numerical values only. Now let us discuss about the
units. We know that the fundamental units in S.I. system of units for length, mass and time are metre,
kilogram and second respectively. While expressing these quantities, we find it time consuming to
write the units such as metres, kilograms and seconds, in full, every time we use them. As a result of
this, we find it quite convenient to use some standard abbreviations :
We shall use  :
m
for metre or metres
km
for kilometre or kilometres
kg
for kilogram or kilograms
t
for tonne or tonnes
s
for second or seconds
min
for minute or minutes

1.14 Mass and Weight
Sometimes much confusion and misunderstanding is created, while using the various systems
of units in the measurements of force and mass. This happens because of the lack of clear understand-
ing of the difference between the mass and weight. The following definitions of mass and weight
should be clearly understood :
Mass. It is the amount of matter contained in a given body and does not vary with the change in
its position on the earth’s surface. The mass of a body is measured by direct comparison with a
standard mass by using a lever balance.
Weight. It is the amount of pull, which the earth exerts upon a given body. Since the pull varies
with the distance of the body from the centre of the earth, therefore, the weight of the body will vary
with its position on the earth’s surface (say latitude and elevation). It is thus obvious, that the weight
is a force.
The pointer of  this spring gauge shows the tension in the hook as the brick is pulled along.
Contents
Top
Introduction     9
The earth’s pull in metric units at sea level and 45° latitude has been adopted as one force unit
and named as one kilogram of force. Thus, it is a definite amount of force. But, unfortunately, has the
same name as the unit of mass.
The weight of a body is measured by the use of a spring balance, which indicates the varying
tension in the spring as the body is moved from place to place.
Note : The confusion in the units of mass and weight is eliminated to a great extent, in S.I units . In this
system, the mass is taken in kg and the weight in newtons. The relation between mass (m) and weight (W) of
a body is
W = m.g   or   m = W / g
where W is in newtons, m in kg and g is the acceleration due to gravity in m/s2.
1.15 Inertia
It is that property of a matter, by virtue of which a body cannot move of itself nor change the
motion imparted to it.
1.16 Laws of  Motion
Newton has formulated three laws of motion, which are the basic postulates or assumptions on
which the whole system of dynamics is based. Like other scientific laws, these are also justified as the
results, so obtained, agree with the actual observations. Following are the three laws of motion :
1. Newton’s First Law of Motion. It states, “Every body continues in its state of rest or of
uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by some external force”. This is also known as
Law of Inertia.
2. Newton’s Second Law of Motion. It states, “The rate of change of momentum is directly
proportional to the impressed force and takes place in the same direction in which the force acts”.
3. Newton’s Third Law of Motion. It states, “To every action, there is always an equal and
opposite reaction”.
1.17 Force
It is an important factor in the field of Engineering science, which may be defined as an agent,
which produces or tends to produce, destroy or tends to destroy motion.
According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, the applied force or impressed force is  directly
proportional to the rate of change of momentum. We know that
Momentum = Mass × Velocity
Let
m = Mass of the body,
u = Initial velocity of the body,
v = Final velocity of the body,
a = Constant acceleration, and
t = Time required to change velocity from u to v.
∴
Change of momentum = mv – mu

In S.I. system of units, the unit of force is called newton (briefly written as N). A newton may
be defined as the force, while acting upon a mass of one kg, produces an acceleration of 1 m/s2 in
the direction in  which it acts. Thus
1N = 1kg × 1 m/s2 = 1kg-m/s2
1.18 Absolute and Gravitational Units of Force
We have already discussed, that when a body of mass 1 kg is moving with an acceleration of
1 m/s2, the force acting on the body is one newton (briefly written as 1 N). Therefore, when the same
body is moving with an acceleration of 9.81 m/s2, the force acting on the body is 9.81N. But we
denote 1 kg mass, attracted towards the earth with an acceleration of 9.81 m/s2 as 1 kilogram force
(briefly written as kgf) or 1 kilogram weight (briefly written as kg-wt). It is thus obvious that
                                    1kgf  = 1kg × 9.81 m/s2 = 9.81 kg-m/s2 = 9.81 N
... (Q 1N = 1kg-m/s2)
The above unit of force i.e. kilogram force (kgf) is called gravitational or engineer’s unit of
force, whereas netwon is the absolute or scientific or S.I. unit of force. It is thus obvious, that the
gravitational units are ‘g’ times the unit of force in the absolute or S. I. units.
It will be interesting to know that the  mass of a body in absolute units is numerically equal to
the weight of the same body in gravitational units.
For example, consider a body whose mass, m = 100 kg.
∴The force, with which it will be attracted towards the centre of the earth,
F = m.a = m.g = 100 × 9.81 = 981 N
Now, as per definition, we know that the weight of a body is the force, by which it is attracted
towards the centre of the earth.

In brief, the weight of a body of mass m kg at a place where gravitational acceleration is ‘g’ m/s2
is m.g newtons.
1.19 Moment of Force
It is the turning effect produced by a force, on the body, on which it acts. The moment of a force
is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular distance of the point, about which the
moment is required, and the line of action of the force. Mathematically,
Moment of a force = F × l
where
F = Force acting on the body, and
l = Perpendicular distance of the point and the line of action of
the force (F) as shown in Fig. 1.2.

1.20 Couple
The two equal and opposite parallel forces, whose lines of action are different form a couple, as
shown in Fig. 1.3.
The perpendicular distance (x) between the lines of action of two equal and opposite parallel
forces is known as arm of the couple. The magnitude of the couple (i.e. moment of a couple) is the
product of one of the forces and the arm of the couple. Mathematically,
Moment of a couple = F × x
A little consideration will show, that a couple does not produce any translatory motion (i.e.
motion in a straight line). But, a couple produces a motion of rotation of the body on which it acts.

The mass density of the material is the mass per unit volume. The following table shows the

moment of 600 newton-metres (N-m). The girl is lighter (200 N) but she stands further from the pivot (3m).
She causes a clockwise moment of 600 N-m, so the seesaw is balanced.

1.22 Mass Moment of Inertia
It has been established since long that a rigid body
is composed of small particles. If the mass of every
particle of a body is multiplied by the square of its
perpendicular distance from a fixed line, then the sum
of these quantities (for the whole body) is known as
mass moment of inertia of the body. It is denoted by I.
Consider a body of total mass m. Let it be
composed of small particles of masses m1, m2, m3, m4,
etc. If k1, k2, k3, k4, etc.,  are the distances from a fixed
line, as shown in Fig. 1.4, then the mass moment of
inertia of the whole body is given by
I = m1 (k1)2 + m2 (k2)2  + m3 (k3)2 + m4 (k4)2 + .....
If the total mass of a body may be assumed to concentrate at one point (known as centre of mass
or centre of gravity), at a distance k from the given axis, such that
mk2 = m1 (k1)2 + m2 (k2)2 + m3 (k3)2 + m4 (k4)2 + .....
then
I = m k2
The distance k is called the radius of gyration. It may be defined as the distance, from a given
reference, where the whole mass of body is assumed to be concentrated to give the same value of
I.
The unit of mass moment of inertia in S.I. units is kg-m2.
Notes : 1. If the moment of inertia of body about an axis through its centre of gravity is known, then the moment
of inertia about any other parallel axis may be obtained by using a parallel axis theorem i.e. moment of inertia
about a parallel axis,
Ip = IG + mh2
where
IG = Moment of inertia of a body about an axis through its centre of
gravity, and
h = Distance between two parallel axes.
2. The following are the values of I for simple cases :
(a) The moment of inertia of a thin disc  of radius r, about an axis through its centre of gravity and
perpendicular to the plane of the disc is,
I = mr2/2 = 0.5 mr2
and moment of inertia about a diameter,
I = mr2/4 = 0.25 mr2
(b) The moment of inertia of a thin rod of length l, about an axis through its centre of gravity and
perpendicular to its length,
IG = ml2/12
and moment of inertia about a parallel axis through one end of a rod,
IP = ml2/3
3. The moment of inertia of a solid cylinder of radius r and length l,about the longitudinal axis or
polar axis
= mr2/2 = 0.5 mr2
and moment of inertia through its centre perpendicular to the longitudinal axis

1.23 Angular Momentum
It is the product of the mass moment of inertia and the angular velocity of the body.
Mathematically,
Angular momentum = I.ω
where
I = Mass moment of inertia, and
ω = Angular velocity of the body.
1.24 Torque
It may be defined as the product of force and the
perpendicular distance of its line of action from the
given point or axis. A little consideration will show that
the torque is equivalent to a couple acting upon a body.
The Newton’s second law of motion when applied
to rotating bodies states, the torque is directly
proportional to the rate of change of angular
momentum.  Mathematically,

1.25 Work
Whenever a force acts on a body and the body undergoes a displacement in the direction of the
force, then work is said to be done. For example, if a force F acting on a body causes a displacement
x of the body in the direction of the force, then
Work done = Force × Displacement = F × x
If the force varies linearly from zero to a maximum value of F, then
Work done =
0

When a couple or torque (T) acting on a body causes the angular displacement (θ) about an axis
perpendicular to the plane of the couple, then
Work done = Torque × Angular displacement = T.θ
The unit of work depends upon the units of force and displacement. In S. I. system of units, the
practical unit of work is N-m. It is the work done by a force of 1 newton, when it displaces a body
through 1 metre. The work of 1 N-m is known as joule (briefly written as J), such that 1 N-m = 1 J.
Note : While writing the unit of work, it is a general practice to put the units of force first followed by the units
of displacement (e.g. N-m).
1.26 Power
It may be defined as the rate of doing work or work done per unit time. Mathematically,
Power, P =
Work done

Contents

14    A Textbook of Machine Design
In S.I system  of units, the unit of power is watt (briefly written as W) which is equal to 1 J/s or
1N-m/s. Thus, the power developed by a force of F (in newtons) moving with a velocity v m/s is F.v
watt. Generally, a bigger unit of power called kilowatt (briefly written as kW) is used which is equal
to 1000 W
Notes : 1. If T is the torque transmitted in N-m or J and ω is angular speed in rad/s, then
Power, P = T.ω = T × 2 π N / 60 watts
... (∴ ω = 2 π N/60)
where N is the speed in r.p.m.
2. The ratio of the power output to power input is known as efficiency of a machine. It is always less than
unity and is represented as percentage. It is denoted by a Greek letter eta ( η). Mathematically,
Efficiency, η = Power output
Power input
1.27 Energy
It may be defined as the capacity to do work.
The energy exists in many forms e.g. mechanical,
electrical, chemical, heat, light, etc. But we are
mainly concerned with mechanical  energy.
The mechanical energy is equal to the
work done on a body in altering either its
position or its velocity. The following three types
of mechanical energies are important from the
subject point of view :
1. Potential energy. It is the energy possessed
by a body, for doing work, by virtue of its position.
For example, a body raised to some height above
the ground level possesses potential energy, because
it can do some work by falling on earth’s surface.
Let
W = Weight of the body,
m = Mass of the body, and
h = Distance through which the body falls.
∴Potential energy,
P.E. = W. h = m.g.h
It may be noted that
(a) When W is in newtons and h in metres, then potential energy will be in N-m.
(b) When m is in kg and h in metres, then the potential energy will also be in N-m as discussed
below :

2. Strain energy. It is the potential energy stored by an elastic body when deformed. A
compressed spring possesses this type of energy, because it can do some work in recovering its
original shape. Thus, if a compressed spring of stiffness (s) N per unit deformation (i.e. extension or
compression) is deformed through a distance x by a weight W, then
Strain energy = Work done =

We know that v2 – u2 = 2 a.s
Since the body starts from rest (i.e. u = 0), therefore,
                         v2 = 2 a.s   or   s = v2 / 2a
In case of a torsional spring of stiffness (q) N-m per unit angular deformation when twisted
through an angle θ radians, then

3. Kinetic energy. It is the energy possessed by a body, for doing work, by virtue of its mass
and velocity of motion. If a body of mass m attains a velocity v from rest in time t, under the influence
of a force F and moves a distance s, then
Work done = F.s = m.a.s
...(Q F = m.a)

3. The energy can neither be created nor destroyed, though it can be transformed from one form into any
of the forms, in which energy can exist. This statement is known as ‘Law of Conservation of Energy’.
4. The loss of energy in any one form is always accompanied by an equivalent increase in another form.
When work is done on a rigid body, the work is converted into kinetic or potential energy or is used in overcom-
ing friction. If the body is elastic, some of the work will also be stored as strain energy.

The word ‘ferrous’ is derived from a latin word ‘ferrum’ which means iron.
The *ferrous metals are those which have the
iron as their main constituent, such as cast iron,
wrought iron and steel.
The non-ferrous metals are those which have
a metal other than iron as their main constituent,
such as copper, aluminium, brass, tin, zinc, etc.
2.3
Selection of Materials for
Engineering Purposes
The selection of a proper material, for
engineering purposes, is one of the most difficult
problem for the designer. The best material is one
which serve the desired objective at the minimum
cost. The following factors should be considered
while selecting the material :
1.
Availability of the materials,
2.
Suitability of the materials for the work-
ing conditions in service, and
3.
The cost of the materials.
The important properties, which determine the
utility of the material are physical, chemical and mechanical properties. We shall now discuss the
physical and mechanical properties of the material in the following articles.
2.4
Physical Properties of Metals
The physical properties of the metals include luster, colour, size and shape, density, electric and
thermal conductivity, and melting point. The following table shows the important physical properties
of some pure metals.

Mechanical Properties of Metals
The mechanical properties of the metals are those which are associated with the ability of the
material to resist mechanical forces and load. These mechanical properties of the metal include strength,
stiffness, elasticity, plasticity, ductility, brittleness, malleability, toughness, resilience, creep and
hardness. We shall now discuss these properties as follows:
1. Strength.  It is the ability of a material to resist the externally applied forces without breaking
or yielding. The internal resistance offered by a part to an externally applied force is called *stress.
2. Stiffness.  It is the ability of a material to resist deformation under stress. The modulus of
elasticity is the measure of stiffness.
3. Elasticity.  It is the property of a material to regain its original shape after deformation when
the external forces are removed. This property is desirable for materials used in tools and machines.
It may be noted that steel is more elastic than rubber.
4. Plasticity.  It is property of a material which retains the deformation produced under load
permanently. This property of the material is necessary for forgings, in stamping images on coins and
in ornamental work.
5. Ductility.  It is the property of a material enabling it to be drawn into wire with the applica-
tion of a tensile force. A ductile material must be both strong and plastic. The ductility is usually
measured by the terms, percentage elongation and percentage reduction in area. The ductile material
commonly used in engineering practice (in order of diminishing ductility) are mild steel, copper,
aluminium, nickel, zinc, tin and lead.
Note :  The ductility of a material is commonly measured by means of percentage elongation and percentage
reduction in area in a tensile test. (Refer Chapter 4, Art. 4.11).

Engineering Materials and their Properties     19
6. Brittleness.  It is the property of a material opposite to ductility. It is the property of breaking
of a material with little permanent distortion. Brittle materials when subjected to tensile loads, snap
off without giving any sensible elongation. Cast iron is a brittle material.
7. Malleability. It is a special case of ductility which permits materials to be rolled or hammered
into thin sheets. A malleable material should be plastic but it is not essential to be so strong. The
malleable materials commonly used in engineering practice (in order of diminishing malleability) are
lead, soft steel, wrought iron, copper and aluminium.
8. Toughness. It is the property of a material to resist fracture due to high impact loads like
hammer blows. The toughness of the material decreases when it is heated. It is measured by the
amount of energy that a unit volume of the
material has absorbed after being stressed upto
the point of fracture. This property is desirable
in parts subjected to shock and impact loads.
9. Machinability. It is the property of a
material which refers to a relative case with
which a material can be cut. The machinability
of a material can be measured in a number of
ways such as comparing the tool life for cutting
different materials or thrust required to remove
the material at some given rate or the energy
required to remove a unit volume of the
material. It may be noted that brass can be
easily machined than steel.
10. Resilience. It is the property of a
material to absorb energy and to resist shock
and impact loads. It is measured by the amount
of energy absorbed per unit volume within
elastic limit. This property is essential for
spring materials.
11. Creep. When a part is subjected to
a constant stress at high temperature for a long
period of time, it will undergo a slow and
permanent deformation called creep. This
property is considered in designing internal
combustion engines, boilers and turbines.
12. Fatigue. When a material is
subjected to repeated stresses, it fails at
stresses below the yield point stresses. Such
type of failure of a material is known as
*fatigue. The failure is caused by means of a
progressive crack formation which are usually
fine and of microscopic size. This property is
considered in designing shafts, connecting rods, springs, gears, etc.
13. Hardness. It is a very important property of the metals and has a wide variety of meanings.
It embraces many different properties such as resistance to wear, scratching, deformation and
machinability etc. It also means the ability of a metal to cut another metal. The hardness is usually

(d)

Ferrous Metals
We have already discussed in Art. 2.2 that the ferrous metals are those which have iron as their
main constituent. The ferrous metals commonly used in engineering practice are cast iron, wrought
iron, steels and alloy steels. The principal raw material for all ferrous metals is pig iron which is
obtained by smelting iron ore with coke and limestone, in the blast furnace. The principal iron ores
with their metallic contents are shown in the following table :

Cast Iron
The cast iron is obtained by re-melting pig iron
with coke and limestone in a furnace known as cupola.
It is primarily an alloy of iron and carbon. The carbon
contents in cast iron varies from 1.7 per cent to 4.5 per
cent. It also contains small amounts of silicon,
manganese, phosphorous and sulphur. The carbon in a
cast iron is present in either of the following two forms:
1. Free carbon or graphite, and 2. Combined car-
bon or cementite.
Since the cast iron is a brittle material, therefore,
it cannot be used in those parts of machines which are
subjected to shocks. The properties of cast iron which
make it a valuable material for engineering purposes
are its low cost, good casting characteristics, high
compressive strength, wear resistance and excellent
machinability. The compressive strength of cast iron is
much greater than the tensile strength. Following are
the values of ultimate strength of cast iron :

Types of Cast Iron
The various types of cast iron in use are discussed as
follows :
1. Grey cast iron. It is an ordinary commercial iron
having the following compositions :
Carbon = 3 to 3.5%; Silicon = 1 to 2.75%; Manganese
= 0.40 to 1.0%; Phosphorous = 0.15 to 1% ; Sulphur = 0.02
to 0.15% ; and the remaining is iron.
The grey colour is due to the fact that the carbon is
present in the form of *free graphite. It has a low tensile
strength, high compressive strength and no ductility. It can
be easily machined. A very good property of grey cast iron
is that the free graphite in its structure acts as a lubricant. Due to this reason, it is very suitable for
those parts where sliding action is desired. The grey iron castings are widely used for machine tool
bodies, automotive cylinder blocks, heads, housings, fly-wheels, pipes and pipe fittings and agricul-
tural implements.

According to Indian standard specifications (IS: 210 – 1993), the grey cast iron is designated by
the alphabets ‘FG’ followed by a figure indicating the minimum tensile strength in MPa or N/mm2.
For example, ‘FG 150’ means grey cast iron with 150 MPa or N/mm2 as minimum tensile strength.
The seven recommended grades of grey cast iron with their tensile strength and Brinell hardness
number (B.H.N) are given in Table 2.3.
2. White cast iron. The white cast iron shows a white fracture and has the following approximate
compositions :
Carbon = 1.75 to 2.3% ; Silicon = 0.85 to 1.2% ; Manganese = less than 0.4% ; Phosphorus
= less than 0.2% ; Sulphur = less than 0.12%, and the remaining is iron.
The white colour is due to fact that it has no graphite and whole of the carbon is in the form of
carbide (known as cementite) which is the hardest constituent of iron. The white cast iron has a high
tensile strength and a low compressive strength. Since it is hard, therefore, it cannot be machined with
ordinary cutting tools but requires grinding as shaping process. The white cast iron may be produced
by casting against metal chills or by regulating analysis. The chills are used when a hard, wear resisting
surface is desired for such products as for car wheels, rolls for crushing grains and jaw crusher plates.
3. Chilled cast iron. It is a white cast iron produced by quick cooling of molten iron. The quick
cooling is generally called chilling and the cast iron so produced is called chilled cast iron. All castings
*
When filing or machining cast iron makes our hands black, then it shows that free graphite is present in cast
iron.
Haematite is an ore of iron. It often
forms kidney-shaped lumps, These
give the ore its nickname of kidney

are chilled at their outer skin by contact of the molten iron with the cool sand in the mould. But on
most castings, this hardness penetrates to a very small depth (less than 1 mm). Sometimes, a casting
is chilled intentionally and sometimes chilled becomes accidently to a considerable depth. The
intentional chilling is carried out by putting inserts of iron or steel (chills) into the mould. When the
molten metal comes into contact with the chill, its heat is readily conducted away and the hard surface
is formed. Chills are used on any faces of a casting which are required to be hard to withstand wear
and friction.
4. Mottled cast iron. It is a product in between grey and white cast iron in composition, colour
and general properties. It is obtained in castings where certain wearing surfaces have been chilled.
5. Malleable cast iron. The malleable iron is a cast iron-carbon alloy which solidifies in the
as-cast condition in a graphite free structure, i.e. total carbon content is present in its combined form
as cementite (Fe3C).
It is ductile and may be bent without breaking or fracturing the section. The tensile strength of
the malleable cast iron is usually higher than that of grey cast iron and has excellent machining
qualities. It is used for machine parts for which the steel forgings would be too expensive and in
which the metal should have a fair degree of accuracy, e.g. hubs of wagon wheels, small fittings for
railway rolling stock, brake supports, parts of agricultural machinery, pipe fittings, door hinges,
locks etc.
In order to obtain a malleable iron castings, it is first cast into moulds of white cast iron. Then
by a suitable heat treatment (i.e. annealing), the combined carbon of the white cast iron is separated
into nodules of graphite. The following two methods are used for this purpose :
1. Whiteheart process, and 2. Blackheart process.
In a whiteheart process, the white iron castings are packed in iron or steel boxes surrounded by
a mixture of new and used haematite ore. The boxes are slowly heated to a temperature of 900 to
950°C and maintained at this temperature for several days. During this period, some of the carbon is
oxidised out of the castings and the remaining carbon is dispersed in small specks throughout the
structure. The heating process is followed by the cooling process which takes several more days. The
result of this heat treatment is a casting which is tough and will stand heat treatment without fracture.
In a blackheart process, the castings used contain less carbon and sulphur. They are packed in
a neutral substance like sand and the reduction of sulphur helps to accelerate the process. The castings
are heated to a temperature of 850 to 900°C and maintained at that temperature for 3 to 4 days. The
carbon in this process transforms into globules, unlike whiteheart process. The castings produced by
this process are more malleable.
Notes : (a) According to Indian standard specifications (*IS : 14329 – 1995), the malleable cast iron may be
either whiteheart, blackheart or pearlitic, according to the chemical composition, temperature and time cycle of
annealing process.
(b) The whiteheart malleable cast iron obtained after annealing in a decarburizing atmosphere have a
silvery-grey fracture with a heart dark grey to black. The microstructure developed in a section depends upon
the size of the section. In castings of small sections, it is mainly ferritic with certain amount of pearlite. In large
sections, microstructure varies from the surface to the core as follows :
Core and intermediate zone : Pearlite + ferrite + temper carbon
Surface zone : Ferrite.
The microstructure shall not contain flake graphite.
*
This standard (IS : 14329-1995) supersedes the previous three standards, i.e.
(a)
IS : 2107–1977 for white heart malleable iron casting,
(b)
IS : 2108–1977 for black heart malleable iron casting, and
(c)
IS : 2640–1977 for pearlitic malleable iron casting.

(c) The blackheart malleable cast iron obtained after annealing in an inert atmosphere have a black
fracture. The microstructure developed in the castings has a matrix essentially of ferrite with temper carbon and
shall not contain flake graphite.
(d) The pearlitic malleable cast iron obtained after heat-treatment have a homogeneous matrix essentially
of pearlite or other transformation products of austenite. The graphite is present in the form of temper carbon
nodules. The microstructure shall not contain flake graphite.
(e) According to IS: 14329 – 1995, the whiteheart, blackheart and pearlitic malleable cast irons are
designated by the alphabets WM, BM and PM respectively. These designations are followed by a figure indicating
the minimum tensile strength in MPa or N/mm2. For example ‘WM 350’ denotes whiteheart malleable cast iron
with 350 MPa as minimum tensile strength. The following are the different grades of malleable cast iron :
Whiteheart malleable cast iron — WM 350 and WM 400
Blackheart malleable cast iron — BM 300 ; BM 320 and BM 350
Pearlitic malleable cast iron — PM 450 ; PM 500 ; PM 550 ; PM 600 and PM 700
6. Nodular or spheroidal graphite cast iron. The nodular or spheroidal graphite cast iron is
also called ductile cast iron or high strength cast iron. This type of cast iron is obtained by adding
small amounts of magnesium (0.1 to 0.8%) to the molten grey iron. The addition of magnesium

causes the *graphite to take form of small nodules or spheroids instead of the normal angular flakes.
It has high fluidity, castability, tensile strength, toughness, wear resistance, pressure tightness,
weldability and machinability. It is generally used for castings requiring shock and impact resistance
along with good machinability, such as hydraulic cylinders, cylinder heads, rolls for rolling mill and
centrifugally cast products.
According to Indian standard specification (IS : 1865-1991), the nodular or spheroidal graphite
cast iron is designated by the alphabets ‘SG’ followed by the figures indicating the minimum tensile
strength in MPa or N/mm2 and the percentage elongation. For example, SG 400/15 means spheroidal
graphite cast iron with 400 MPa as minimum tensile strength and 15 percent elongation. The Indian
standard (IS : 1865 – 1991) recommends nine grades of spheroidal graphite cast iron based on
mechanical properties measured on separately-cast test samples and six grades based on mechanical
properties measured on cast-on sample as given in the Table 2.4.
The letter A after the designation of the grade indicates that the properties are obtained on cast-
on test samples to distinguish them from those obtained on separately-cast test samples.

Alloy Cast Iron
The cast irons as discussed in Art. 2.8 contain small percentages of other constituents like
silicon, manganese, sulphur and phosphorus. These cast irons may be called as plain cast irons. The
alloy cast iron is produced by adding alloying elements like nickel, chromium, molybdenum, copper
and manganese in sufficient quantities. These alloying elements give more strength and result in
improvement of properties. The alloy cast iron has special properties like increased strength, high
wear resistance, corrosion resistance or heat resistance. The alloy cast irons are extensively used for

The graphite flakes in cast iron act as discontinuities in the matrix and thus lower its mechanical properties.
The sharp corners of the flakes also act as stress raisers. The weakening effect of the graphite can be
reduced by changing its form from a flake to a spheroidal form.

gears, automobile parts like cylinders, pistons, piston rings, crank cases, crankshafts, camshafts, sprock-
ets, wheels, pulleys, brake drums and shoes, parts of crushing and grinding machinery etc.
2.10 Effect of Impurities on Cast Iron
We have discussed in the previous articles that the cast iron contains
small percentages of silicon, sulphur, manganese and phosphorous. The
effect of these impurities on the cast iron are as follows:
1. Silicon. It may be present in cast iron upto 4%. It provides the
formation of free graphite which makes the iron soft and easily
machinable. It also produces sound castings free from blow-holes,
because of its high affinity for oxygen.
2. Sulphur. It makes the cast iron hard and brittle. Since too much
sulphur gives unsound casting, therefore, it should be kept well below
0.1% for most foundry purposes.
3. Manganese. It makes the cast iron white and hard. It is often
kept below 0.75%. It helps to exert a controlling influence over the
harmful effect of sulphur.
4. Phosphorus. It aids fusibility and fluidity in cast iron, but
induces brittleness. It is rarely allowed to exceed 1%. Phosphoric irons
are useful for casting of intricate design and for many light engineering
castings when cheapness is essential.
2.11 Wrought Iron
It is the purest iron which contains at least 99.5% iron but may contain upto 99.9% iron. The
typical composition of a wrought iron is
Carbon = 0.020%, Silicon = 0.120%, Sulphur = 0.018%, Phosphorus = 0.020%, Slag = 0.070%,
and the remaining is iron.
The wrought iron is produced from pig iron by remelting it in the puddling furnace of
reverberatory type. The molten metal free from impurities is removed from the furnace as a pasty
mass of iron and slag. The balls of this pasty mass, each about 45 to 65 kg are formed. These balls
are then mechanically worked both to squeeze out the slag and to form it into some commercial
shape.
The wrought iron is a tough, malleable and ductile material. It cannot stand sudden and excessive
shocks. Its ultimate tensile strength is 250 MPa to 500 MPa and the ultimate compressive strength is
300 MPa.
It can be easily forged or welded. It is used for chains, crane hooks, railway couplings, water
and steam pipes.
Phosphorus is a non-metallic
element. It must be stored
underwater (above), since it
catches fire when exposed to
air, forming a compound.

2.12 Steel
It is an alloy of iron and carbon, with carbon content up to a maximum of 1.5%. The carbon
occurs in the form of iron carbide, because of its ability to increase the hardness and strength of the
steel. Other elements e.g. silicon, sulphur, phosphorus and manganese are also present to greater or
lesser amount to impart certain desired properties to it. Most of the steel produced now-a-days is
plain carbon steel or simply carbon steel.  A carbon steel is defined as a steel which has its properties
mainly due to its carbon content and does not contain more than 0.5% of silicon and 1.5% of manganese.
The plain carbon steels varying from 0.06% carbon to 1.5% carbon are divided into the following
types depending upon the carbon content.
1.
Dead mild steel
— up to 0.15% carbon
2.
Low carbon or mild steel
— 0.15% to 0.45% carbon
3.
Medium carbon steel
— 0.45% to 0.8% carbon
4.
High carbon steel
— 0.8% to 1.5% carbon
According to Indian standard *[IS : 1762 (Part-I)–1974], a new system of designating the
steel is recommended. According to this standard, steels are designated on the following two
basis :
(a)
On the basis of mechanical properties, and   (b)   On the basis of chemical composition.
We shall now discuss, in detail, the designation of steel on the above two basis, in the following
pages.
2.13 Steels Designated on the Basis of Mechanical Properties
These steels are carbon and low alloy steels where the main criterion in the selection and in-
spection of steel is the tensile strength or yield stress. According to Indian standard **IS: 1570 (Part–I)-
1978 (Reaffirmed 1993), these steels are designated by a symbol ‘Fe’ or ‘Fe E’ depending on whether

This standard was reaffirmed in 1993 and covers the code designation of wrought steel based on letter
symbols.
**
The Indian standard IS : 1570-1978 (Reaffirmed 1993) on wrought steels for general engineering purposes
has been revised on the basis of experience gained in the production and use of steels. This standard is now
available in seven parts.
Á The ocean floor contains huge amounts of manga-
nese (a metal used in steel and industrial processes).
The manganese is in the form of round lumps called
nodules, mixed with other elements, such as iron and
nickel. The nodules are dredged up by ships fitted
with hoselines which scrape and suck at the ocean
floor.
Á Nodules look rather like
hailstones. The minerals
are washed into the
sea by erosion of the
land. About one-fifth of
the nodule is manga-
nese.

the steel has been specified on the basis of minimum tensile strength or yield strength, followed by the
figure indicating the minimum tensile strength or yield stress in N/mm2. For example ‘Fe 290’ means
a steel having minimum tensile strength of 290 N/mm2 and ‘Fe E 220’ means a steel having yield
strength of 220 N/mm2.

2.15 Effect of Impurities on Steel
The following are the effects of impurities like silicon, sulphur, manganese and phosphorus on
steel.
1. Silicon. The amount of silicon in the finished steel usually ranges from 0.05 to 0.30%.
Silicon is added in low carbon steels to prevent them from becoming porous. It removes the gases and
oxides, prevent blow holes and thereby makes the steel tougher and harder.
2. Sulphur. It occurs in steel either as iron sulphide or manganese sulphide. Iron sulphide
because of its low melting point produces red shortness, whereas manganese sulphide does not effect
so much. Therefore, manganese sulphide is less objectionable in steel than iron sulphide.
3. Manganese. It serves as a valuable deoxidising and purifying agent in steel. Manganese
also combines with sulphur and thereby decreases the harmful effect of this element remaining in the
steel. When used in ordinary low carbon steels, manganese makes the metal ductile and of good
bending qualities. In high speed steels, it is used to toughen the metal and to increase its critical
temperature.
4. Phosphorus. It makes the steel brittle. It also produces cold shortness in steel. In low carbon
steels, it raises the yield point and improves the resistance to atmospheric corrosion. The sum of
carbon and phosphorus usually does not exceed 0.25%.
It is used for making baffle springs, shock
absorbers, springs for seat cushions for road
vehicles. It is also used for making rail tyres,
unhardened gears and worms, washers,
wood working saw, textile and jute
machinery parts and clutch plates, etc.
It is used for making light flat springs
formed from annealed stock. Because of
good wear properties when properly heat
treated, it is used for making shear blades,
rack teeth, scrappers and cutlivators’
shovels.
These steels are used for making flat and
coil springs for automobile and railway
vehicles. It is also used for girder rails. The
valve spring wire and music wire are special
applications of steel 85 C6. After suitable
heat treatment, these steels are also used for
making scraper blades, discs and spring
tooth harrows. It is also used for clutch parts,
wood working saw, band saw and textile and
jute machinery parts.
These steels in the oil hardened and
tempered condition are used for coil or spiral
springs. It is also used for pen nibs, volute
spring, spring cutlery, knitting needle and
hacksaw blades.

2.16 Free Cutting Steels
The free cutting steels contain sulphur and phosphorus. These steels have higher sulphur content
than other carbon steels. In general, the carbon content of such steels vary from 0.1 to 0.45 per cent
and sulphur from 0.08 to 0.3 per cent. These steels are used where rapid machining is the prime
requirement. It may be noted that the presence of sulphur and phosphorus causes long chips in machining
to be easily broken and thus prevent clogging of machines. Now a days, lead is used from 0.05 to 0.2
per cent instead of sulphur, because lead also greatly improves the machinability of steel without the
loss of toughness.
According to Indian standard, IS : 1570 (Part III)-1979 (Reaffirmed 1993), carbon and carbon
manganese free cutting steels are designated in the following order :
1.
Figure indicating 100 times the average percentage of carbon,
2.
Letter ‘C’,
3.
Figure indicating 10 times the average percentage of manganese, and
4.
Symbol ‘S’ followed by the figure indicating the 100 times the average content of sulphur.
If instead of sulphur, lead (Pb) is added to make the steel free cutting, then symbol ‘Pb’
may be used.

2.17 Alloy Steel
An alloy steel may be defined as a steel to which elements other than carbon are added in
sufficient amount to produce an improvement in properties. The alloying is done for specific purposes
to increase wearing resistance, corrosion resistance and to improve electrical and magnetic properties,
which cannot be obtained in plain carbon steels. The chief alloying elements used in steel are nickel,
chromium, molybdenum, cobalt, vanadium, manganese, silicon and tungsten. Each of these elements
confer certain qualities upon the steel to which it is added. These elements may be used separately or
in combination to produce the desired characteristic in steel. Following are the effects of alloying
elements on steel:
1. Nickel. It increases the strength and toughness of the steel. These steels contain 2 to 5%
nickel and from 0.1 to 0.5% carbon. In this range, nickel contributes great strength and hardness with
high elastic limit, good ductility and good resistance to corrosion. An alloy containing 25% nickel
possesses maximum toughness and offers the greatest resistance to rusting, corrosion and burning at
high temperature. It has proved to be of advantage in the manufacture of boiler tubes, valves for use
with superheated steam, valves for I.C. engines and spark plugs for petrol engines. A nickel steel
alloy containing 36% of nickel is known as invar. It has nearly zero coefficient of expansion. So it is
in great demand for measuring instruments and standards of lengths for everyday use.
2. Chromium. It is used in steels as an alloying element to combine hardness with high strength
and high elastic limit. It also imparts corrosion-resisting properties to steel. The most common chrome
steels contains from 0.5 to 2% chromium and 0.1 to 1.5% carbon. The chrome steel is used for balls,
rollers and races for bearings. A nickel chrome steel containing 3.25% nickel, 1.5% chromium and
0.25% carbon is much used for armour plates. Chrome nickel steel is extensively used for motor car
crankshafts, axles and gears requiring great strength and hardness.
3. Tungsten. It prohibits grain growth, increases the depth of hardening of quenched steel and
confers the property of remaining hard even when heated to red colour. It is usually used in conjuction
with other elements. Steel containing 3 to 18% tungsten and 0.2 to 1.5% carbon is used for cutting
tools. The principal uses of tungsten steels are for cutting tools, dies, valves, taps and permanent
magnets.

4. Vanadium. It aids in obtaining a fine
grain structure in tool steel. The addition of a very
small amount of vanadium (less than 0.2%)
produces a marked increase in tensile strength and
elastic limit in low and medium carbon steels
without a loss of ductility. The chrome-vanadium
steel containing about 0.5 to 1.5% chromium, 0.15
to 0.3% vanadium and 0.13 to 1.1% carbon have
extremely good tensile strength, elastic limit,
endurance limit and ductility. These steels are
frequently used for parts such as springs, shafts,
gears, pins and many drop forged parts.
5. Manganese. It improves the strength of
the steel in both the hot rolled and heat treated condition. The manganese alloy steels containing over
1.5% manganese with a carbon range of 0.40 to 0.55% are used extensively in gears, axles, shafts and
other parts where high strength combined with fair ductility is required. The principal uses of manganese
steel is in machinery parts subjected to severe wear. These steels are all cast and ground to finish.
6. Silicon. The silicon steels behave like nickel steels. These steels have a high elastic limit as
compared to ordinary carbon steel. Silicon steels containing from 1 to 2% silicon and 0.1 to 0.4%
carbon and other alloying elements are used for electrical machinery, valves in I.C. engines, springs
and corrosion resisting materials.
7. Cobalt. It gives red hardness by retention of hard carbides at high temperatures. It tends to
decarburise steel during heat-treatment. It increases hardness and strength and also residual magnetism
and coercive magnetic force in steel for magnets.
8. Molybdenum. A very small quantity (0.15 to 0.30%) of molybdenum is generally used with
chromium and manganese (0.5 to 0.8%) to make molybdenum steel. These steels possess extra tensile
strength and are used for air-plane fuselage and automobile parts. It can replace tungsten in high
speed steels.
2.18 Indian Standard Designation of Low and Medium Alloy Steels
According to Indian standard, IS : 1762 (Part I)-1974 (Reaffirmed 1993), low and medium
alloy steels shall be designated in the following order :
1.
Figure indicating 100 times the average percentage carbon.
2.
Chemical symbol for alloying elements each followed by the figure for its average
percentage content multiplied by a factor as given below :
Element
Multiplying factor
Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, Si and W
4
Al, Be, V, Pb, Cu, Nb, Ti, Ta, Zr and Mo
10
P, S and N
100
For example 40 Cr 4 Mo 2 means alloy steel having average 0.4% carbon, 1% chromium
and 0.25% molybdenum.
Notes : 1. The figure after multiplying shall be rounded off to the nearest integer.
2. Symbol ‘Mn’ for manganese shall be included in case manganese content is equal to or greater than
1 per cent.
3. The chemical symbols and their figures shall be listed in the designation in the order of decreasing
content.
Table 2.8 shows the composition and uses of some low and medium alloy steels according to
Indian standard IS : 1570-1961 (Reaffirmed 1993).
This is a fan blade from a jumbo jet engine. On
take-off, the stress on the metal is immense, so to
prevent the fan from flying apart, the blades must
be both light and very strong. Titanium, though
expensive, is the only suitable metal.

2.19 Stainless Steel
It is defined as that steel which when correctly
heat treated and finished, resists oxidation and
corrosive attack from most corrosive media. The
different types of stainless steels are discussed
below :
1. Martensitic stainless steel. The chromium
steels containing 12 to 14 per cent chromium and 0.12
to 0.35 per cent carbon are the first stainless steels
developed. Since these steels possess martensitic
structure, therefore, they are called martensitic
stainless steels. These steels are magnetic and may
be hardened by suitable heat treatment and the
hardness obtainable depends upon the carbon content.
These steels can be easily welded and machined. When
formability, softness, etc. are required in fabrication,
steel having 0.12 per cent maximum carbon is often
used in soft condition. With increasing carbon, it is
possible by hardening and tempering to obtain tensile
strength in the range of 600 to 900 N/mm2, combined
with reasonable toughness and ductility. In this
condition, these steels find many useful general
applications where mild corrosion resistance is
required. Also, with the higher carbon range in the
hardened and lightly tempered condition, tensile
strength of about 1600 N/mm2 may be developed with
lowered ductility.
These steels may be used where the corrosion
conditions are not too severe, such as for hydraulic,
steam and oil pumps, valves and other engineering
components. However, these steels are not suitable
for shafts and parts working in contact with non-ferrous metals (i.e. brass, bronze or gun metal bearings)
and with graphite packings, because electrolytic corrosion is likely to occur. After hardening and
light tempering, these steels develop good cutting properties. Therefore, they are used for cutlery,
springs, surgical and dental instruments.
Note:  The presence of chromium provides good resistance to scaling upto a temperature of about 750°C, but it
is not suitable where mechanical strength in the temperature range of 600 to 750°C is required. In fact, creep
resistance of these steels at this temperature is not superior to that of mild steel. But at temperature below 600°C,
the strength of these steels is better than that of carbon steels and upto 480°C is even better than that of austenitic
steels.
2. Ferritic stainless steel. The steels containing greater amount of chromium (from 16 to 18
per cent) and about 0.12 per cent carbon are called ferritic stainless steels. These steels have better
corrosion resistant property than martensitic stainless steels. But, such steels have little capacity for
hardening by heat treatment. However, in the softened condition, they possess good ductility and are
mainly used as sheet or strip for cold forming and pressing operations for purposes where moderate
corrosion resistance is required. They may be cold worked or hot worked. They are ferro-magnetic,
usually undergo excessive grain growth during prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures, and
may develop brittleness after electric arc resistance or gas welding. These steels have lower strength
Stainless  steel was invented in 1913 by British
metallurgist Harry Brearley (1871-1948). He
made a steel containing 13 per cent
chromium. The new alloy proved to be highly
resistant to corrosion: chromium reacts with
oxygen in the air to form a tough, protective
film which renews itself if the metal is
scratched.

Engineering Materials and their Properties     37
at elevated temperatures than martensitic steels. However, resistance to scaling and corrosion at
elevated temperatures are usually better. The machinability is good and they show no tendency to
intercrystalline corrosion.
Note: When nickel from 1.5 to 2.5 per cent is added to 16 to 18 per cent chromium steel, it not only makes more
resistant to corrosion than martensitic steel but also makes it hardenable by heat treatment. Such a steel has good
resistance to electrolytic corrosion when in contact with non-ferrous metals and graphite packings. Thus it is
widely used for pump shafts, spindles and valves as well as for many other fittings where a good combination of
mechanical and corrosion properties are required.
3. Austenitic stainless steel. The steel containing high content of both chromium and nickel
are called austenitic stainless steels. There are many variations in chemical composition of these
steels, but the most widely used steel contain 18 per cent chromium and 8 per cent nickel with carbon
content as low as possible. Such a steel is commonly known as 18/8 steel. These steels cannot be
hardened by quenching, in fact they are softened by rapid cooling from about 1000°C. They are non-
magnetic and possess greatest resistance to corrosion and good mechanical properties at elevated
temperature.
These steels are very tough and can be forged and rolled but offer great difficulty in machining.
They can be easily welded, but after welding, it is susceptible to corrosive attack in an area adjacent
to the weld. This susceptibility to corrosion (called intercrystalline corrosion or weld decay) may be
removed by softening after welding by heating to about 1100°C and cooling rapidly. These steels are
used in the manufacture of pump shafts, rail road car frames and sheathing, screws, nuts and bolts and
small springs. Since 18/8 steel provide excellent resistance to attack by many chemicals, therefore, it
is extensively used in chemical, food, paper making and dyeing industries.
Note : When increased corrosion resistance properties are required, for some purposes, then molybdenum from
2 to 3 per cent may be added.
2.20 Heat Resisting Steels
The steels which can resist creep and oxidation at high temperatures and retain sufficient strength
are called heat resisting steels. A number of heat resisting steels have been developed as discussed
below :
1. Low alloy steels. These steels contain 0.5 per cent molybdenum. The main application of
these steels are for superheater tubes and pipes in steam plants, where service temperatures are in the
range of 400°C to 500°C.
2. Valve steels. The chromium-silicon steels such as silchrome (0.4% C, 8% Cr, 3.5% Si) and
Volmax (0.5% C, 8% Cr, 3.5% Si, 0.5% Mo) are used for automobile valves. They possess good
resistance to scaling at dull red heat, although their strength at elevated temperatures is relatively low.
For aeroplane engines and marine diesel engine valves, 13/13/3 nickel-chromium-tungsten valve
steel is usually used.
3. Plain chromium steel. The plain chromium steel consists of
(a)
Martensitic chromium steel with 12–13% Cr, and
(b)
Ferritic chromium steels with 18–30% Cr.
These steels are very good for oxidation resistance at high temperatures as compared to their
strength which is not high at such conditions. The maximum operating temperature for martensitic
steels is about 750°C, whereas for ferritic steels it is about 1000 – 1150°C.
4. Austenitic chromium-nickel steels. These steels have good mechanical properties at high
temperatures with good scaling resistance. These alloys contain a minimum of 18 per cent chromium
and 8 per cent nickel stabilised with titanium or niobium. Other carbide forming elements such as
molybdenum or tungsten may also be added in order to improve creep strength. Such alloys are
suitable for use upto 1100°C and are used for gas turbine discs and blades.

Heat Resisting Steel)
According to Indian standard, IS : 1762 (Part I)-1974 (Reaffirmed 1993), the high alloy steels
(i.e. stainless steel and heat resisting steel) are designated in the following order:
1.
Letter ‘X’.
2.
Figure indicating 100 times the percentage of carbon content.
3.
Chemical symbol for alloying elements each followed by a figure for its average percentage
content rounded off to the nearest integer.
4.
Chemical symbol to indicate specially added element to allow the desired properties.
For example, X 10 Cr 18 Ni 9 means alloy steel with average carbon 0.10 per cent, chromium
18 per cent and nickel 9 per cent.
Table 2.9 shows the composition and uses of some types of the stainless steels and heat resisting
steels according to Indian standard IS : 1570 (Part V)-1985 (Reaffirmed 1991).
2.22 High Speed Tool Steels
These steels are used for cutting metals at a much higher cutting speed than ordinary carbon
tool steels. The carbon steel cutting tools do not retain their sharp cutting edges under heavier loads
and higher speeds. This is due to
the fact that at high speeds,
sufficient heat may be developed
during the cutting operation and
causes the temperature of the
cutting edge of the tool to reach
a red heat. This temperature
would soften the carbon tool steel
and thus the tool will not work
efficiently for a longer period.
The high speed steels have the
valuable property of retaining
their hardness even when heated
to red heat. Most of the high
speed steels contain tungsten as
the chief alloying element, but other elements like cobalt, chromium, vanadium, etc. may be present
in some proportion. Following are the different types of high speed steels:
1. 18-4-1 High speed steel. This steel, on an average, contains 18 per cent tungsten, 4 per cent
chromium and 1 per cent vanadium. It is considered to be one of the best of all purpose tool steels. It
is widely used for drills, lathe, planer and shaper tools, milling cutters, reamers, broaches, threading
dies, punches, etc.
2. Molybdenum high speed steel. This steel, on an average, contains 6 per cent tungsten, 6 per
cent molybdenum, 4 per cent chromium and 2 per cent vanadium. It has excellent toughness and
cutting ability. The molybdenum high speed steels are better and cheaper than other types of steels. It
is particularly used for drilling and tapping operations.
3. Super high speed steel. This steel is also called cobalt high speed steel because cobalt is
added from 2 to 15 per cent, in order to increase the cutting efficiency especially at high temperatures.
This steel, on an average, contains 20 per cent tungsten, 4 per cent chromium, 2 per cent vanadium
and 12 per cent cobalt. Since the cost of this steel is more, therefore, it is principally used for heavy
cutting operations which impose high pressure and temperatures on the tool.
Gold is found mixed with quartz rock, deep underground. Most met-
als occur in their ores as compounds. Gold is so unreactive that it
occurs naturally as pure metal.

steels are designated in the following order :

percentage content rounded off to the  nearest integer, and
4.
Chemical symbol to indicate specially added element to attain the desired properties.
For example, XT 75 W 18 Cr 4 V 1 means a tool steel with average carbon content 0.75 per
cent, tungsten 18 per cent, chromium 4 per cent and vanadium 1 per cent.
Table 2.10 shows the composition of high speed tool steels as per Indian standard, IS : 7291-
1981 (Reaffirmed 1993).
2.24 Spring Steels
The most suitable material for springs are those which can store up the maximum amount of
work or energy in a given weight or volume of spring material, without permanent deformation.
These steels should have a high elastic limit as well as high deflection value. The spring steel, for
aircraft and automobile purposes should possess maximum strength against fatigue effects and shocks.
The steels most commonly used for making springs are as follows:
1. High carbon steels. These steels contain 0.6 to 1.1 per cent carbon, 0.2 to 0.5 per cent
silicon and 0.6 to 1 per cent manganese. These steels are heated to 780 – 850°C according to the
composition and quenched in oil or water. It is then tempered at 200 – 500°C to suit the particular
application. These steels are used for laminated springs for locomotives, carriages, wagons, and for
heavy road vehicles. The higher carbon content oil hardening steels are used for volute, spiral and
conical springs and for certain types of petrol engine inlet valve springs.
2. Chrome-vanadium steels. These are high quality spring steels and contain 0.45 to 0.55
per cent carbon, 0.9 to 1.2 per cent
chromium, 0.15 to 0.20 per cent
vanadium, 0.3 to 0.5 per cent silicon
and 0.5 to 0.8 per cent manganese.
These steels have high elastic limit,
resistance to fatigue and impact stresses.
Moreover, these steels can be machined
without difficulty and can be given a
smooth surface free from tool marks.
These are hardened by oil quenching at
850 – 870°C and tempered at 470 –
510°C for vehicle and other spring
purposes. These steels are used for
motor car laminated and coil springs for
suspension purposes, automobile and
aircraft engine valve springs.
3. Silicon-manganese steels. These steels contain 1.8 to 2.0 per cent silicon, 0.5 to 0.6 per
cent carbon and 0.8 to 1 per cent manganese. These steels have high fatigue strength, resistance and
toughness. These are hardened by quenching in oil at 850 – 900°C and tempered at 475 – 525°C.
These are the usual standard quality modern spring materials and are much used for many engineering
purposes.
Sodium is in Group I. Although it is a metal, it is so soft that
a knife can cut easily through a piece. Sodium is stored
in oil to stop air or moisture reacting with it.

2.25 Heat Treatment of Steels
The term heat treatment may be defined as an operation or a combination of operations, involving
the heating and cooling of a metal or an alloy in the solid state for the purpose of obtaining certain
desirable conditions or properties without change in chemical composition. The aim of heat treatment
is to achieve one or more of the following objects :
1.
To increase the hardness of metals.
2.
To relieve the stresses set up in the material after hot or cold working.
3.
To improve machinability.
4.
To soften the metal.
5.
To modify the structure of the material to improve its electrical and magnetic properties.
6.
To change the grain size.
7.
To increase the qualities of a metal to provide better resistance to heat, corrosion and
wear.
Following are the various heat treatment processes commonly employed in engineering practice:
1.
Normalising. The main objects of normalising are :
1. To refine the grain structure of the steel to improve machinability, tensile strength and
structure of weld.
2. To remove strains caused by cold working processes like hammering, rolling, bending,
etc., which makes the metal brittle and unreliable.
3. To remove dislocations caused in the internal structure of the steel due to hot working.
4. To improve certain mechanical and electrical properties.
The process of normalising consists of heating the steel from 30 to 50°C above its upper critical
temperature (for hypoeutectoid steels) or Acm line (for hypereutectoid steels). It is held at this
temperature for about fifteen minutes and then allowed to cool down in still air.
This process provides a homogeneous structure consisting of ferrite and pearlite for hypoeutectoid
steels, and pearlite and cementite for hypereutectoid steels. The homogeneous structure provides a
higher yield point, ultimate tensile strength and impact strength with lower ductility to steels. The
process of normalising is frequently applied to castings and forgings, etc. The alloy steels may also be
normalised but they should be held for two hours at a specified temperature and then cooling in the
furnace.
Notes : (a) The upper critical temperature for a steel depends upon its carbon content. It is 900°C for pure iron,
860°C for steels with 2.2% carbon, 723°C for steel with 0.8% carbon and 1130°C for steel with 1.8% carbon.
(b) Steel containing 0.8% carbon is known as eutectoid steel, steel containing less than 0.8% carbon is
called hypoeutectoid steel and steel containing above 0.8% carbon is called hypereutectoid steel.
2. Annealing. The main objects of annealing are :
1.
To soften the steel so that it may be easily machined or cold worked.
2.
To refine the grain size and structure to improve mechanical properties like strength
and ductility.
3.
To relieve internal stresses which may have been caused by hot or cold working or by
unequal contraction in casting.
4.
To alter electrical, magnetic or other physical properties.
5.
To remove gases trapped in the metal during initial casting.
The annealing process is of the following two types :
(a) Full annealing. The purpose of full annealing is to soften the metal to refine the grain
structure, to relieve the stresses and to remove trapped gases in the metal. The process consists of
Contents
Top
Engineering Materials and their Properties     43
(i)
heating the steel from 30 to 50°C above the upper critical temperature for hypoeutectoid
steel and by the same temperature above the lower critical temperature i.e. 723°C for
hypereutectoid steels.
(ii)
holding it at this temperature for sometime to enable the internal changes to take place.
The time allowed is approximately 3 to 4 minutes for each millimetre of thickness of the
largest section, and
(iii)
cooling slowly in the furnace. The rate of cooling varies from 30 to 200°C per hour
depending upon the composition of steel.
In order to avoid decarburisation of the steel during annealing, the steel is packed in a cast iron
box containing a mixture of cast iron borings, charcoal, lime, sand or ground mica. The box along
with its contents is allowed to cool slowly in the furnace after proper heating has been completed.
The following table shows the approximate temperatures for annealing depending upon the
carbon contents in steel.

0.50 to 0.80 (Medium carbon steel)
780 – 810
5.
0.80 to 1.50 (High carbon or tool steel)
760 – 780
(b) Process annealing. The process annealing is used for relieving the internal stresses previously
set up in the metal and for increasing the machinability of the steel. In this process, steel is heated to
a temperature below or close to the lower critical temperature, held at this temperature for sometime
and then cooled slowly. This causes complete recrystallisation in steels which have been severely
cold worked and a new grain structure is formed. The process annealing is commonly used in the
sheet and wire industries.
3. Spheroidising. It is another form of annealing in
which cementite in the granular form is produced in the
structure of steel. This is usually applied to high carbon tool
steels which are difficult to machine. The operation consists
of heating the steel to a temperature slightly above the lower
critical temperature (730 to 770°C). It is held at this
temperature for some time and then cooled slowly to a
temperature of 600°C. The rate of cooling is from 25 to 30°C
per hour.
The spheroidising improves the machinability of steels,
but lowers the hardness and tensile strength. These steels
have better elongation properties than the normally annealed
steel.
4. Hardening. The main objects of hardening are :
1.
To increase the hardness of the metal so that it
can resist wear.
2.
To enable it to cut other metals i.e. to make it
suitable for cutting tools.
Clay can be hardened by heat.
Bricks and ceramic items are made
by firing soft clay objects in a  kiln.

44    A Textbook of Machine Design
The process of hardening consists of
(a)
heating the metal to a temperature from 30 to 50°C above the upper critical point for
hypoeutectoid steels and by the same temperature above the lower critical point for
hypereutectoid steels.
(b)
keeping the metal at this temperature for a considerable time, depending upon its thickness.
(c)
quenching (cooling suddenly) in a suitable cooling medium like water, oil or brine.
It may be noted that the low carbon steels cannot be hardened appreciably, because of the
presence of ferrite which is soft and is not changed by the treatment. As the carbon content goes on
increasing, the possible obtainable hardness also increases.
Notes : 1.  The greater the rate of quenching, the harder is the resulting structure of steel.
2. For hardening alloy steels and high speed steels, they are heated from 1100°C to 1300°C followed by
cooling in a current of air.
5. Tempering. The steel hardened by rapid quenching is very hard and brittle. It also contains
internal stresses which are severe and unequally distributed to cause cracks or even rupture of hardened
steel. The tempering (also known as drawing) is, therefore, done for the following reasons :
1.
To reduce brittleness of the hardened steel and thus to increase ductility.
2.
To remove the internal stresses caused by rapid cooling of steel.
3.
To make steel tough to resist shock and fatigue.
The tempering process consists of reheating the hardened steel to some temperature below the
lower critical temperature, followed by any desired rate of cooling. The exact tempering temperature
depends upon the purpose for which the article or tool is to be used.
6. Surface hardening or case hardening. In many engineering applications, it is desirable that
a steel being used should have a hardened surface to resist wear and tear. At the same time, it should
have soft and tough interior or core so that it is able to absorb any shocks, etc. This is achieved by
hardening the surface layers of the article while the rest of it is left as such. This type of treatment is
applied to gears, ball bearings, railway wheels, etc.
Following are the various *surface or case hardening processes by means of which the surface
layer is hardened:
1. Carburising, 2. Cyaniding, 3. Nitriding, 4. Induction hardening, and 5. Flame hardening.
2.26 Non-ferrous Metals
We have already discussed that the non-ferrous metals are those which contain a metal other
than iron as their chief constituent. The non-ferrous metals are usually employed in industry due to
the following characteristics :
1.
Ease of fabrication (casting, rolling, forging, welding and machining),
2.
Resistance to corrosion,
3.
Electrical and thermal conductivity, and
4.
Weight.
The various non-ferrous metals used in engineering practice are aluminium, copper, lead, tin,
zinc, nickel, etc. and their alloys. We shall now discuss these non-ferrous metals and their alloys in
detail, in the following pages.
2.27 Aluminium
It is white metal produced by electrical processes from its oxide (alumina), which is prepared
from a clayey mineral called bauxite. It is a light metal having specific gravity 2.7 and melting point
658°C. The tensile strength of the metal varies from 90 MPa to 150 MPa.

Engineering Materials and their Properties     45
In its pure state, the metal would be weak and soft for most purposes, but when mixed with
small amounts of other alloys, it becomes hard and rigid. So, it may be blanked, formed, drawn,
turned, cast, forged and die cast. Its good electrical conductivity is an important property and is
widely used for overhead cables. The high resistance to corrosion and its non-toxicity makes it a
useful metal for cooking utensils under ordinary condition and thin foils are used for wrapping food
items. It is extensively used in aircraft and automobile components where saving of weight is an
advantage.
2.28 Aluminium Alloys
The aluminium may be alloyed with one or more other elements like copper, magnesium,
manganese, silicon and nickel. The addition of small quantities of alloying elements converts the soft
and weak metal into hard and strong metal, while still retaining its light weight. The main aluminium
alloys are discussed below:
1. Duralumin. It is an important and interesting wrought alloy. Its composition is as follows:
Copper = 3.5 – 4.5%; Manganese = 0.4 – 0.7%; Magnesium = 0.4 – 0.7%, and the remainder is
aluminium.
This alloy possesses maximum tensile strength (upto 400 MPa) after heat treatment and age
hardening. After working, if the metal is allowed to age for 3 or 4 days, it will be hardened. This
phenomenon is known as age hardening.
It is widely used in wrought conditions for forging, stamping, bars, sheets, tubes and rivets. It
can be worked in hot condition at a temperature of 500°C. However, after forging and annealing, it
can also be cold worked. Due to its high strength and light weight, this alloy may be used in automobile
and aircraft components. It is also used in manufacturing connecting rods, bars, rivets, pulleys, etc.
2. Y-alloy. It is also called copper-aluminium alloy. The addition of copper to pure aluminium
increases its strength and machinability. The composition of this alloy is as follows :
Copper = 3.5 – 4.5%; Manganese = 1.2 – 1.7%; Nickel = 1.8 – 2.3%; Silicon, Magnesium, Iron
= 0.6% each; and the remainder is aluminium.
This alloy is heat treated and age hardened like duralumin. The ageing process is carried out at
room temperature for about five days.
It is mainly used for cast purposes, but it can also be used for forged components like duralumin.
Since Y-alloy  has better strength (than duralumin) at high temperature, therefore, it is much used in
aircraft engines for cylinder heads and pistons.
3. Magnalium. It is made by melting the aluminium with 2 to 10% magnesium in a vacuum
and then cooling it in a vacuum or under a pressure of 100 to 200 atmospheres. It also contains about
1.75% copper. Due to its light weight and good mechanical properties, it is mainly used for aircraft
and automobile components.
4. Hindalium. It is an alloy of aluminium and magnesium with a small quantity of chromium.
It is the trade name of aluminium alloy produced by Hindustan Aluminium Corporation Ltd, Renukoot
(U.P.). It is produced as a rolled product in 16 gauge, mainly for anodized utensil manufacture.
2.29 Copper
It is one of the most widely used non-ferrous metals in industry. It is a soft, malleable and
ductile material with a reddish-brown appearance. Its specific gravity is 8.9 and melting point is
1083°C. The tensile strength varies from 150 MPa to 400 MPa under different conditions. It is a good
conductor of electricity. It is largely used in making electric cables and wires for electric machinery
and appliances, in electrotyping and electroplating, in making coins and household utensils.

It may be cast, forged, rolled and drawn into wires.
It is non-corrosive under ordinary conditions and resists
weather very effectively. Copper in the form of tubes is
used widely in mechanical engineering. It is also used for
making ammunitions. It is used for making useful alloys
with tin, zinc, nickel and aluminium.
2.30 Copper Alloys
The copper alloys are broadly classified into the
following two groups :
1. Copper-zinc alloys (Brass). The most widely
used copper-zinc alloy is brass. There are various types
of brasses, depending upon the proportions of copper and
zinc. This is fundamentally a binary alloy of copper with
zinc each 50%. By adding small quantities of other
elements, the properties of brass may be greatly changed.
For example, the addition of lead (1 to 2%) improves the
machining quality of brass. It has a greater strength than
that of copper, but have a lower thermal and electrical
conductivity. Brasses are very resistant to atmospheric
corrosion and can be easily soldered. They can be easily
fabricated by processes like spinning and can also be
electroplated with metals like nickel and chromium. The
following table shows the composition of various types
of brasses according to Indian standards.
 Materials are used to build a modern car.
Electrical cables often consist of fine
strands of copper wire woven together
and encased in a plastic sleeve.
Malachite is an ore of copper. Its dramatic
bands of dark green make it popular in
jewellery.

2. Copper-tin alloys (Bronze). The alloys of copper and tin are usually termed as bronzes. The
useful range of composition is 75 to 95% copper and 5 to 25% tin. The metal is comparatively hard,
resists surface wear and can be shaped or rolled into wires, rods and sheets very easily. In corrosion
resistant properties, bronzes are superior to brasses. Some of the common types of bronzes are as
follows:
(a)
Phosphor bronze. When bronze contains phosphorus, it is called phosphor bronze.
Phosphorus increases the strength, ductility and soundness of castings. The tensile strength
of this alloy when cast varies from 215 MPa to 280 MPa but increases upto 2300 MPa
when rolled or drawn. This alloy possesses good wearing qualities and high elasticity. The
metal is resistant to salt water corrosion. The composition of the metal varies according to
whether it is to be forged, wrought or made into castings. A common type of phosphor
bronze has the following composition according to Indian standards :
Copper = 87–90%, Tin = 9–10%, and Phosphorus = 0.1–3%.
It is used for bearings, worm wheels, gears, nuts for machine lead screws, pump parts,
linings and for many other purposes. It is also suitable for making springs.
(b)
Silicon bronze. It contains 96% copper, 3% silicon and 1% manganese or zinc. It has
good general corrosion resistance of copper combined with higher strength. It can be cast,
rolled, stamped, forged and pressed either hot or cold and it can be welded by all the usual
methods.
It is widely used for boilers, tanks, stoves or where high strength and good corrosion
resistance is required.
(c)
Beryllium bronze. It is a copper base alloy containing about 97.75% copper and 2.25%
beryllium. It has high yield point, high fatigue limit and excellent cold and hot corrosion
resistance. It is particularly suitable material for springs, heavy duty electrical switches,
cams and bushings. Since the wear resistance of beryllium copper is five times that of
phosphor bronze, therefore, it may be used as a bearing metal in place of phosphor bronze.

It has a film forming and a soft lubricating property, which makes it more suitable as a
bearing metal.
(d)
Manganese bronze. It is an alloy of copper, zinc and little percentage of manganese. The
usual composition of this bronze is as follows:
Copper = 60%, Zinc = 35%, and Manganese = 5%
This metal is highly resistant to corrosion. It is harder and stronger than phosphor bronze.
It is generally used for bushes, plungers, feed pumps, rods etc. Worm gears are frequently
made from this bronze.
(e)
Aluminium bronze. It is an alloy of copper and aluminium. The aluminium bronze with
6–8% aluminium has valuable cold working properties. The maximum tensile strength of
this alloy is 450 MPa with 11% of aluminium. They are most suitable for making
components exposed to severe corrosion conditions. When iron is added to these bronzes,
the mechanical properties are improved by refining the grain size and improving the
ductility.
Aluminium bronzes are widely used for making gears, propellers, condenser bolts, pump
components, tubes, air pumps, slide valves and bushings, etc. Cams and rollers are also
made from this alloy. The 6% aluminium alloy has a fine gold colour which is used for
imitation jewellery and decorative purposes.
2.31 Gun Metal
It is an alloy of copper, tin and zinc. It usually contains 88% copper, 10% tin and 2% zinc. This
metal is also known as Admiralty gun metal. The zinc is added to clean the metal and to increase its
fluidity.
It is not suitable for being worked in the cold state but may be forged when at about 600°C. The
metal is very strong and resistant to corrosion by water and atmosphere. Originally, it was made for
casting guns. It is extensively used for casting boiler fittings, bushes, bearings, glands, etc.
2.32 Lead
It is a bluish grey metal having specific gravity 11.36 and melting point 326°C. It is so soft that
it can be cut with a knife. It has no tenacity. It is extensively used for making solders, as a lining for
acid tanks, cisterns, water pipes, and as coating for electrical cables.
The lead base alloys are employed where a cheap and corrosion resistant material is required.
An alloy containing 83% lead, 15% antimony, 1.5% tin and 0.5% copper is used for large bearings
subjected to light service.
2.33 Tin
It is brightly shining white metal. It is soft, malleable and ductile. It can be rolled into very thin
sheets. It is used for making important alloys, fine solder, as a protective coating for iron and steel
sheets and for making tin foil used as moisture proof packing.
A tin base alloy containing 88% tin, 8% antimony and 4% copper is called babbit metal. It is a
soft material with a low coefficient of friction and has little strength. It is the most common bearing
metal used with cast iron boxes where the bearings are subjected to high pressure and load.
Note : Those alloys in which lead and tin are predominating are designated as white metal bearing alloys. This
alloy is used for lining bearings subjected to high speeds like the bearings of aero-engines.
2.34 Bearing Metals
The following are the widely used bearing metals :
1. Copper-base alloys, 2. Lead-base alloys, 3. Tin-base alloys, and 4. Cadmium-base alloys
Contents
Top
Engineering Materials and their Properties     49
The copper base alloys are the most important bearing alloys. These alloys are harder and
stronger than the white metals (lead base and tin base alloys) and are used for bearings subjected to
heavy pressures. These include brasses and bronzes which are discussed in Art 2.30. The lead base
and tin base alloys are discussed in Art. 2.32 and 2.33. The cadmium base alloys contain 95%
cadmium and 5% silver. It is used for medium loaded bearings subjected to high temperature.
The selection of a particular type of bearing metal depends upon the conditions under which it
is to be used. It involves factors relating to bearing pressures, rubbing speeds, temperatures, lubrication,
etc. A bearing material should have the following properties:
1.
It should have low coefficient of friction.
2.
It should have good wearing qualities.
3.
It should have ability to withstand bearing pressures.
4.
It should have ability to operate satisfactorily with suitable lubrication means at the maxi-
mum rubbing speeds.
5.
It should have a sufficient melting point.
6.
It should have high thermal conductivity.
7.
It should have good casting qualities.
8.
It should have minimum shrinkage after casting.
9.
It should have non-corrosive properties.
10.
It should be economical in cost.
2.35 Zinc Base Alloys
The most of the die castings are produced from zinc base alloys. These alloys can be casted
easily with a good finish at fairly low temperatures. They have also considerable strength and are low
in cost. The usual alloying elements for zinc are aluminium, copper and magnesium and they are all
held in close limits.
The composition of two standard die casting zinc alloys are as follows :
1.
Aluminium 4.1%, copper 0.1%, magnesium 0.04% and the remainder is zinc.
2.
Aluminium 4.1%, copper 1%, magnesium 0.04% and the remainder is zinc.
Aluminium improves the mechanical properties and also reduces the tendency of zinc to dissolve
iron. Copper increases the tensile strength, hardness and ductility.
Magnesium has the beneficial effect of making the castings permanently
stable. These alloys are widely used in the automotive industry and for
other high production markets such as washing machines, oil burners,
refrigerators, radios, photographs, television, business machines, etc.
2.36 Nickel Base Alloys
The nickel base alloys are widely used in engineering industry on
account of their high mechanical strength properties, corrosion resistance,
etc. The most important nickel base alloys are discussed below:

operate under intermittent heating and cooling conditions. It is widely used in gas turbine engines.
2.37 Non-metallic Materials
The non-metallic materials are used in engineering practice due to their low density, low cost,
flexibility, resistant to heat and electricity. Though there are many non-metallic materials, yet the
following are important from the subject point of view.
1. Plastics. The plastics are synthetic materials
which are moulded into shape under pressure with or
without the application of heat. These can also be cast,
rolled, extruded, laminated and machined. Following are
the two types of plastics :
(a)
Thermosetting plastics, and
(b)
Thermoplastic.
The thermosetting plastics are those which are
formed into shape under heat and pressure and results in
a permanently hard product. The heat first softens the
material, but as additional heat and pressure is applied, it
becomes hard by a chemical change known as phenol-
formaldehyde (Bakelite), phenol-furfural (Durite), urea-
formaldehyde (Plaskon), etc.
The thermoplastic materials do not become hard with
the application of heat and pressure and no chemical change
occurs. They remain soft at elevated temperatures until
they are hardened by cooling. These can be remelted repeatedly by successive application of heat. Some
of the common thermoplastics are cellulose nitrate (Celluloid), polythene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl
chloride (P.V.C.), etc.
The plastics are extremely resistant to corrosion and have a high dimensional stability. They are
mostly used in the manufacture of aeroplane and automobile parts. They are also used for making
safety glasses, laminated gears, pulleys, self-lubricating bearing, etc. due to their resilience and strength.
2. Rubber. It is one of the most important natural plastics. It resists abrasion, heat, strong
alkalis and fairly strong acids. Soft rubber is used for electrical insulations. It is also used for power
transmission belting, being applied to woven cotton or cotton cords as a base. The hard rubber is used
for piping and as lining for pickling tanks.
3. Leather. It is very flexible and can withstand considerable wear under suitable conditions. It
is extensively used for power transmission belting and as a packing or as washers.
4. Ferrodo. It is a trade name given to asbestos lined with lead oxide. It is generally used as a
friction lining for clutches and brakes.
Reinforced  plastic with fibreglass
makes the material to withstand high
compressive as well as tensile stresses.

used in Mechanical Engineering. We shall now discuss in
this chapter a few of the manufacturing processes, limits
and fits, etc.
3.2
Manufacturing Processes
The knowledge of manufacturing processes is of great
importance for a design engineer. The following are the
various manufacturing processes used in Mechanical
Engineering.
1. Primary shaping processes. The processes used
for the preliminary shaping of the machine component are
known as primary shaping processes. The common
operations used for this process are casting, forging,
extruding, rolling, drawing, bending, shearing, spinning,
powder metal forming, squeezing, etc.

2. Machining processes. The processes used for giving final shape to the machine component,
according to planned dimensions are known as machining processes. The common operations used
for this process are turning, planning, shaping, drilling, boring, reaming, sawing, broaching, milling,
grinding, hobbing, etc.
3. Surface finishing processes. The processes used to provide a good surface finish for the
machine component are known as surface finishing processes. The common operations used for this
process are polishing, buffing, honing, lapping, abrasive belt grinding, barrel tumbling, electroplating,
superfinishing, sheradizing, etc.
4. Joining processes. The processes used for joining machine components are known as joining
processes. The common operations used for this process are welding, riveting, soldering, brazing,
screw fastening, pressing, sintering, etc.
5. Processes effecting change in properties. These processes are used to impart certain specific
properties to the machine components so as to make them suitable for particular operations or uses.
Such processes are heat treatment, hot-working, cold-working and shot peening.
To discuss in detail all these processes is beyond the scope of this book, but a few of them which
are important from the subject point of view will be discussed in the following pages.
3.3
Casting
It is one of the most important manufacturing process used in Mechanical Engineering. The
castings are obtained by remelting of ingots* in a cupola or some other foundry furnace and then
pouring this molten metal into metal or sand moulds. The various important casting processes are as
follows:
1. Sand mould casting. The casting produced by pouring molten metal in sand mould is called
sand mould casting. It is particularly used for parts of larger sizes.
2. Permanent mould casting. The casting produced by pouring molten metal in a metallic
mould is called permanent mould casting. It is used for casting aluminium pistons, electric iron parts,
cooking utensils, gears, etc. The permanent mould castings have the following advantages:
*
Most of the metals used in industry are obtained from ores. These ores are subjected to suitable reducing or
refining process which gives the metal in a molten form. This molten metal is poured into moulds to give
commercial castings, called ingots.
1. Shaping the Sand : A wooden pattern cut to
the shape of one half of the casting is positioned
in an iron box and surrounded by tightly packed
moist sand.
2. Ready for the Metal : After the wooden pat-
terns have been removed, the two halves of the
mould are clamped together. Molten iron is poured
into  opening called the runner.

(a)
It has more favourable fine grained structure.
(b)
The dimensions may be obtained with close tolerances.
(c)
The holes up to 6.35 mm diameter may be easily cast with metal cores.
3. Slush casting. It is a special application of permanent metal mould casting. This method is
used for production of hollow castings without the use of cores.
4. Die casting. The casting produced by
forcing molten metal under pressure into a permanent
metal mould (known as die) is called die casting. A
die is usually made in two halves and when closed it
forms a cavity similar to the casting desired. One half
of the die that remains stationary is known as cover
die and the other movable half is called ejector die.
The die casting method is mostly used for castings of
non-ferrous metals of comparatively low fusion
temperature. This process is cheaper and quicker than
permanent or sand mould casting. Most of the
automobile parts like fuel pump, carburettor bodies,
horn, heaters, wipers, brackets, steering wheels, hubs
and crank cases are made with this process. Following are the advantages and disadvantages of die
casting :
Advantages
(a)
The production rate is high, ranging up to 700 castings per hour.
(b)
It gives better surface smoothness.
(c)
The dimensions may be obtained within tolerances.
(d)
The die retains its trueness and life for longer periods. For example, the life of a die for
zinc base castings is upto one million castings, for copper base alloys upto 75 000 castings
and for aluminium base alloys upto 500 000 castings.

(e)
It requires less floor area for equivalent production by other casting methods.
( f )
By die casting, thin and complex shapes can be easily produced.
(g)
The holes up to 0.8 mm can be cast.
Disadvantages
(a)
The die casting units are costly.
(b)
Only non-ferrous alloys are casted more economically.
(c)
It requires special skill for maintenance and operation of a die casting machine.
      5.  Centrifugal casting. The casting produced by a process in which molten metal is poured and
allowed to solidify while the mould is kept revolving, is known as centrifugal casting. The metal thus
poured is subjected to centrifugal force due to which it flows in the mould cavities. This results in the
production of high density castings with promoted directional solidification. The examples of
centrifugal castings are pipes, cylinder liners and sleeves, rolls, bushes, bearings, gears, flywheels,
gun barrels, piston rings, brake drums, etc.
3.4
Casting Design
An engineer must know how to design the castings so that they can effectively and efficiently
render the desired service and can be produced easily and economically. In order to design a casting,
the following factors must be taken into consideration :
1.
The function to be performed by the casting,
2.
Soundness of the casting,
3.
Strength of the casting,
4.
Ease in its production,
5.
Consideration for safety, and
6.
Economy in production.
In order to meet these requirements, a design engineer should have a thorough knowledge of
production methods including pattern making, moulding, core making, melting and pouring, etc. The
best designs will be achieved only when one is able to make a proper selection out of the various
available methods. However, a few rules for designing castings are given below to serve as a guide:
1.
The sharp corners and frequent use of fillets should be avoided in order to avoid
concentration of stresses.
2.
All sections in a casting should be designed of uniform thickness, as far as possible. If,
however, variation is unavoidable, it should be done gradually.
3.
An abrupt change of an extremely thick section into a very thin section should always be
avoided.
4.
The casting should be designed as simple as possible, but with a good appearance.
5.
Large flat surfaces on the casting should be avoided because it is difficult to obtain true
surfaces on large castings.
6.
In designing a casting, the various allowances must be provided in making a pattern.
7.
The ability to withstand contraction stresses of some members of the casting may be
improved by providing the curved shapes e.g., the arms of pulleys and wheels.
8.
The stiffening members such as webs and ribs used on a casting should be minimum
possible in number, as they may give rise to various defects like hot tears and shrinkage,
etc.
9.
The casting should be designed in such a way that it will require a simpler pattern and its
moulding is easier.
10.
In order to design cores for casting, due consideration should be given to provide them
adequate support in the mould.
Contents
Top
Manufacturing Considerations in Machine Design      57
11.
The deep and narrow pockets in the casting should  invariably be avoided to reduce cleaning
costs.
12.
The use of metal inserts in the casting should be kept minimum.
13.
The markings such as names or numbers, etc., should never be provided on vertical surfaces
because they provide a hindrance in the withdrawl of pattern.
14.
A tolerance of ± 1.6 mm on small castings (below 300 mm) should be provided. In case
more dimensional accuracy is desired, a tolerance of ± 0.8 mm may be provided.
3.5
Forging
It is the process of heating a metal to a desired temperature in order to acquire sufficient plasticity,
followed by operations like hammering, bending and pressing, etc. to give it a desired shape. The
various forging processes are :
1.
Smith forging or hand forging
2.
Power forging,
3.
Machine forging or upset forging, and
4.
Drop forging or stamping
The smith or hand forging is done by means of hand tools and it is usually employed for small
jobs. When the forging is done by means of power hammers, it is then known as power forging. It is
used for medium size and large articles requiring very heavy blows. The machine forging is done by
means of forging machines. The drop forging is carried out with the help of drop hammers and is
particularly suitable for mass production of identical parts. The forging process has the following
advantages :
1.
It refines the structure of the metal.
2.
It renders the metal stronger by setting the direction of grains.
3.
It effects considerable saving in time, labour and material as compared to the production
of a similar item by cutting from a solid stock and then shaping it.
4.
The reasonable degree of accuracy may be obtained by forging.
5.
The forgings may be welded.
It may be noted that wrought iron and various types of steels and steel alloys are the common
raw material for forging work. Low carbon steels respond better to forging work than the high carbon
steels. The common non-ferrous metals and alloys used in forging work are brass, bronze, copper,
aluminium and magnesium alloys. The following table shows the temperature ranges for forging
some common metals.

3.6
Forging Design
In designing a forging, the following points should always be considered.
1.
The forged components should ultimately be able to achieve a radial flow of grains or
fibres.
2.
The forgings which are likely to carry flash, such as drop and press forgings, should
preferably have the parting line in such a way that the same will divide them in two equal
halves.
3.
The parting line of a forging should lie, as far as possible, in one plane.
4.
Sufficient draft on surfaces should be provided to facilitate easy removal of forgings from
dies.
5.
The sharp corners should always be avoided in order to prevent concentration of stress
and to facilitate ease in forging.
6.
The pockets and recesses in forgings should be minimum in order to avoid increased
die wear.
7.
The ribs should not be high and thin.
8.
Too thin sections should be avoided to facilitate easy flow of metal.
3.7
Mechanical Working of Metals
The mechanical working of metals is defined as an intentional deformation of metals plastically
under the action of externally applied forces.
The mechanical working of metal is described as hot working and cold working depending
upon whether the metal is worked above or below the recrystallisation temperature. The metal is
subjected to mechanical working for the following purposes :
1.
To reduce the original block or ingot into desired shapes,
2.
To refine grain size, and
3. To control the direction of flow lines.
3.8
Hot Working
The working of metals above the *recrystallisation temperature is called hot working. This
temperature should not be too high to reach the solidus temperature, otherwise the metal will burn
and become unsuitable for use. The hot working of metals has the following advantages and
disadvantages :
Advantages
1.
The porosity of the metal is largely eliminated.
2.
The grain structure of the metal is refined.
3.
The impurities like slag are squeezed into fibres and distributed throughout the metal.
4.
The mechanical properties such as toughness, ductility, percentage elongation, percentage
reduction in area, and resistance to shock and vibration are improved due to the refinement
of grains.
Disadvantages
1.
It requires expensive tools.
2.
It produces poor surface finish, due to the rapid oxidation and scale formation on the
metal surface.
3.
Due to the poor surface finish, close tolerance cannot be maintained.
*
The temperature at which the new grains are formed in the metal is known as recrystallisation temperature.

Cold Rolled Steel  : Many modern prod-
ucts are made from easily shaped sheet
metal.
3.9
Hot Working Processes
The various *hot working processes are described as below :
1. Hot rolling. The hot rolling
process is the most rapid method of
converting large sections into desired
shapes. It consists of passing the hot ingot
through two rolls rotating in opposite
directions at the same speed. The space
between the rolls is adjusted to conform
to the desired thickness of the rolled
section. The rolls, thus, squeeze the
passing ingot to reduce its cross-section
and increase its length. The forming of
bars, plates, sheets, rails, angles, I-beam
and other structural sections are made by
hot rolling.
2. Hot forging. It consists of
heating the metal to plastic state and then the pressure is applied to form it into desired shapes and
sizes. The pressure applied in this is not continuous as for hot rolling, but intermittent. The pressure
may be applied by hand hammers, power hammers or by forging machines.
3. Hot spinning. It consists of heating the metal to forging temperature and then forming it into
the desired shape on a spinning lathe. The parts of circular cross-section which are symmetrical about
the axis of rotation, are made by this process.
4. Hot extrusion. It consists of pressing a metal inside
a chamber to force it out by high pressure through an orifice
which is shaped to provide the desired form of the finished
part. Most commercial metals and their alloys such as steel,
copper, aluminium and nickel are directly extruded at elevated
temperatures. The rods, tubes, structural shapes, flooring strips
and lead covered cables, etc., are the typical products of
extrusion.
5. Hot drawing or cupping. It is mostly used for the
production of thick walled seamless tubes and cylinders. It is
usually performed in two stages. The first stage consists of
drawing a cup out of a hot circular plate with the help of a die
and punch. The second stage consists of reheating the drawn
cup and drawing it further to the desired length having the
required wall thickness. The second drawing operation is
performed through a number of dies, which are arranged in a
descending order of their diameters, so that the reduction of
wall thickness is gradual in various stages.
6. Hot piercing. This process is used for the
manufacture of seamless tubes. In its operation, the heated
cylindrical billets of steel are passed between two conical
shaped rolls operating in the same direction. A mandrel is provided between these rolls which assist
in piercing and controls the size of the hole, as the billet is forced over it.
Hot Rolling : When steel is heated until it glows bright red, it
becomes soft enough to form into elabrate shapes.

3.10   Cold Working
The working of metals below their recrystallisation temperature is known as cold working.
Most of the cold working processes are performed at room temperature. The cold working distorts
the grain structure and does not provide an appreciable reduction in size. It requires much higher
pressures than hot working. The extent to which a metal can be cold worked depends upon its ductil-
ity. The higher the ductility of the metal, the more it can be cold worked. During cold working, severe
stresses known as residual stresses are set up. Since the presence of these stresses is undesirable,
therefore, a suitable heat treatment may be employed to neutralise the effect of these stresses. The
cold working is usually used as finishing operation, following the shaping of the metal by hot work-
ing. It also increases tensile strength, yield strength and hardness of steel but lowers its ductility. The
increase in hardness due to cold working is called work-hardening.
In general, cold working produces the following effects :
1.
The stresses are set up in the metal which remain in the metal, unless they are removed by
subsequent heat treatment.
2.
A distortion of the grain structure is created.
3.
The strength and hardness of the metal are increased with a corresponding loss in ductility.
4.
The recrystalline temperature for steel is increased.
5.
The surface finish is improved.
6.
The close dimensional tolerance can be maintained.
3.11 Cold Working Processes
The various cold working processes are discussed below:
1. Cold rolling. It is generally employed for bars of all shapes, rods, sheets and strips, in order
to provide a smooth and bright surface finish. It is also used to finish the hot rolled components to
close tolerances and improve their toughness and hardness. The hot rolled articles are first immersed
in an acid to remove the scale and washed in water, and then dried. This process of cleaning the
articles is known as pickling. These cleaned articles are then passed through rolling mills. The rolling
mills are similar to that used in hot rolling.
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is now being manufactured as an alternative to silicon for
microchips. This combination of elements is a semiconductor like silicon, but is electronically
faster and therefore better for microprocessors.

2. Cold forging. The cold forging is also called swaging. During this method of cold working,
the metal is allowed to flow in some pre-determined shape according to the design of dies, by a
compressive force or impact. It is widely used in forming ductile metals. Following are the three,
commonly used cold forging processes :
(a)
Sizing. It is the simplest form of cold forging. It is the operation of slightly compressing a
forging, casting or steel assembly to obtain close tolerance and a flat surface. The metal is
confined only in a vertical direction.
(b)
Cold heading. This process is extensively used for making bolts, rivets and other similar
headed parts. This is usually done on a cold header machine. Since the cold header is
made from unheated material, therefore, the equipment must be able to withstand the high
pressures that develop. The rod is fed to the machine where it is cut off and moved into the
header die. The operation may be either single or double and upon completion, the part is
ejected from the dies.
After making the bolt head, the threads are produced on a thread rolling machine. This is
also a cold working process. The process consists of pressing the blank between two
rotating rolls which have the thread form cut in their surface.
(c)
Rotary swaging. This method is used for reducing the diameter of round bars and tubes by
rotating dies which open and close rapidly on the work. The end of rod is tapered or
reduced in size by a combination of pressure and impact.
3. Cold spinning. The process of cold spinning is similar to hot spinning except that the metal
is worked at room temperature. The process of cold spinning is best suited for aluminium and other
soft metals. The commonly used spun articles out of aluminum and its alloys are processing kettles,
cooking utensils, liquid containers, and light reflectors, etc.
4. Cold extrusion. The principle of cold extrusion is exactly similar to hot extrusion. The most
common cold extrusion process is impact extrusion. The operation of cold extrusion is performed
with the help of a punch and die. The work material is placed in position into a die and struck from top
Making microchips demands extreme control over chemical components. The layers of conducting
and insulating materials that are laid down on the surface of a silicon chip may be only a few atoms
thick yet must perform to the highest specifications. Great care has to be taken in their manufacture
(right), and each chip is checked by test probes to ensure it performs correctly.

by a punch operating at high pressure and speed. The metal flows up along the surface of the punch
forming a cup-shaped component. When the punch moves up, compressed air is used to separate the
component from the punch. The thickness of the side wall is determined by the amount of clearance
between the punch and die. The process of impact extrusion is limited to soft and ductile materials
such as lead, tin, aluminium, zinc and some of their alloys. The various items of daily use such as
tubes for shaving creams and tooth pastes and such other thin walled products are made by impact
extrusion.
5. Cold drawing. It is generally employed for bars, rods, wires, etc. The important cold drawing
processes are as follows:
(a)
Bar or rod drawing. In bar drawing, the hot drawn bars or rods from the mills are first
pickled, washed and coated to prevent oxidation. A draw bench, is employed for cold
drawing. One end of the bar is reduced in diameter by the swaging operation to permit it
to enter a drawing die. This end of bar is inserted through the die and gripped by the jaws
of the carriage fastened to the chain of the draw bench. The length of bars which can be
drawn is limited by the maximum travel of the carriage, which may be from 15 metres to
30 metres. A high surface finish and dimensional accuracy is obtained by cold drawing.
The products may be used directly without requiring any machining.
(b)
Wire drawing. In wire drawing, the rolled bars from the mills are first pickled, washed
and coated to prevent oxidation. They are then passed through several dies of decreasing
diameter to provide the desired reduction in size. The dies are usually made of carbide
materials.
(c)
Tube drawing. The tube drawing is similar to bar drawing and in most cases it is
accomplished with the use of a draw bench.
6. Cold bending. The bars, wires, tubes, structural shapes and sheet metal may be bent to many
shapes in cold condition through dies. A little consideration will show that when the metal is bend
beyond the elastic limit, the inside of the bend will be under compression while the outside will be
under tension. The stretching of the metal on the outside makes the stock thinner. Usually, a flat strip
of metal is bend by roll forming. The materials commonly used for roll forming are carbon steel,
stainless steel, bronze, copper, brass, zinc and aluminium. Some of its products are metal windows,
screen frame parts, bicycle wheel rims, trolley rails, etc. Most of the tubing is now-a-days are roll
formed in cold conditions and then welded by resistance welding.
7. Cold peening. This process is used to improve the fatigue resistance of the metal by setting
up compressive stresses in its surface. This is done by blasting or hurling a rain of small shot at high
velocity against the surface to be peened. The shot peening is done by air blast or by some mechanical
means. As the shot strikes, small indentations are produced, causing a slight plastic flow of the surface
metal to a depth of a few hundreds of a centimetre. This stretching of the outer fibres is resisted by
those underneath, which tend to return them to their original length, thus producing an outer layer
having a compressive stress while those below are in tension. In addition, the surface is slightly
hardened and strengthened by the cold working operation.
3.12 Interchangeability
The term interchangeability is normally employed for the mass production of indentical items
within the prescribed limits of sizes. A little consideration will show that in order to maintain the sizes
of the part within a close degree of accuracy, a lot of time is required. But even then there will be
small variations. If the variations are within certain limits, all parts of equivalent size will be equally
fit for operating in machines and mechanisms. Therefore, certain variations are recognised and allowed
in the sizes of the mating parts to give the required fitting. This facilitates to select at random from a

large number of parts for an assembly and results in a considerable saving in the cost of production.
In order to control the size of finished part, with due allowance for error, for interchangeable parts is
called limit system.
It may be noted that when an assembly is made of two parts, the part which enters into the other,
is known as enveloped surface (or shaft for cylindrical part) and the other in which one enters is
called enveloping surface (or hole for cylindrical part).
Notes: 1. The term shaft refers not only to the diameter of a circular shaft, but it is also used to designate any
external dimension of a part.
2. The term hole refers not only to the diameter of a circular hole, but it is also used to designate any
internal dimension of a part.
3.13 Important Terms used in Limit System
The following terms used in limit system
(or interchangeable system) are important from
the subject point of view:
1. Nominal size. It is the size of a part
specified in the drawing as a matter of conve-
nience.
2. Basic size. It is the size of a part to which
all limits of variation (i.e. tolerances) are applied
to arrive at final dimensioning of the mating parts.
The nominal or basic size of a part is often the
same.
3. Actual size.  It is the actual measured
dimension of the part. The difference between the basic size and the actual size should not exceed a
certain limit, otherwise it will interfere with the interchangeability of the mating parts.
4. Limits of sizes. There are two extreme permissible sizes for a dimension of the part as
shown in Fig. 3.1. The largest permissible size for a dimension of the part is called upper or high or
maximum limit, whereas the smallest size of the part is known as lower or minimum limit.
5. Allowance. It is the difference between the basic dimensions of the mating parts. The
allowance may be positive or negative. When the shaft size is less than the hole size, then the allowance
is positive and when the shaft size is greater than the hole size, then the allowance is negative.
6. Tolerance. It is the difference between the upper limit and lower limit of a dimension. In
other words, it is the maximum permissible variation in a dimension. The tolerance may be unilateral
or bilateral. When all the tolerance is allowed on one side of the nominal size, e.g. 
0.000
–0.004
20+
, then it
is said to be unilateral system of tolerance. The unilateral system is mostly used in industries as it
permits changing the tolerance value while still retaining the same allowance or type of fit.
Fig. 3.2. Method of assigning tolerances.
Fig. 3.1. Limits of sizes.
Contents
Top
64    A Textbook of Machine Design
When the tolerance is allowed on both sides of the nominal size, e.g. 
0.002
–0.002
20+
, then it is said to
be bilateral system of tolerance. In this case + 0.002 is the upper limit and – 0.002 is the lower limit.
The method of assigning unilateral and bilateral tolerance is shown in Fig. 3.2 (a) and
(b) respectively.
7. Tolerance zone. It is the zone between the maximum and minimum limit size, as shown in
Fig. 3.3.
Fig. 3.3. Tolerance zone.
8. Zero line. It is a straight line corresponding to the basic size. The deviations are measured
from this line. The positive and negative deviations are shown above and below the zero line
respectively.
9. Upper deviation. It is the algebraic difference between the maximum size and the basic size.
The upper deviation of a hole is represented by a symbol ES (Ecart Superior) and of a shaft, it is
represented by es.
10. Lower deviation. It is the algebraic difference between the minimum size and the basic size.
The lower deviation of a hole is represented by a symbol EI (Ecart Inferior) and of a shaft, it is
represented by ei.
11. Actual deviation. It is the algebraic difference between an actual size and the corresponding
basic size.
12. Mean deviation. It is the arithmetical mean between the upper and lower deviations.
13. Fundamental deviation. It is one of the two deviations which is conventionally chosen to
define the position of the tolerance zone in relation to zero line, as shown in Fig. 3.4.

3.14 Fits
The degree of tightness or looseness between the two mating parts is known as a fit of the parts.
The nature of fit is characterised by the presence and size of clearance and interference.
The clearance is the amount by which the actual size of the shaft is less than the actual size of
the mating hole in an assembly as shown in Fig. 3.5 (a). In other words, the clearance is the difference
between the sizes of the hole and the shaft before assembly. The difference must be positive.
Fig. 3.5. Types of fits.
The interference is the amount by which the actual size of a shaft is larger than the actual
finished size of the mating hole in an assembly as shown in Fig. 3.5 (b). In other words, the interference
is the arithmetical difference between the sizes of the hole and the shaft, before assembly. The difference
must be negative.
3.15 Types of Fits
According to Indian standards, the fits are classified into the following three groups :
1. Clearance fit. In this type of fit, the size limits for mating parts are so selected that clearance
between them always occur, as shown in Fig. 3.5 (a). It may be noted that in a clearance fit, the
tolerance zone of the hole is entirely above the tolerance zone of the shaft.
In a clearance fit, the difference between the minimum size of the hole and the maximum size of
the shaft is known as minimum clearance whereas the difference between the maximum size of the
hole and minimum size of the shaft is called maximum clearance as shown in Fig. 3.5 (a).

Contents
Top
66    A Textbook of Machine Design
The clearance fits may be slide fit, easy sliding fit, running fit, slack running fit and loose
running fit.
2. Interference fit. In this type of fit, the size limits for the mating parts are so selected that
interference between them always occur, as shown in Fig. 3.5 (b). It may be noted that in an interference
fit, the tolerance zone of the hole is entirely below the tolerance zone of the shaft.
In an interference fit, the difference between the maximum size of the hole and the minimum
size of the shaft is known as minimum interference, whereas the difference between the minimum
size of the hole and the maximum size of the shaft is called maximum interference, as shown in Fig.
3.5 (b).
The interference fits may be shrink fit, heavy drive fit and light drive fit.
3. Transition fit. In this type of fit, the size limits for the mating parts are so selected that either
a clearance or interference may occur depending upon the actual size of the mating parts, as shown in
Fig. 3.5 (c). It may be noted that in a transition fit, the tolerance zones of hole and shaft overlap.
The transition fits may be force fit, tight fit and push fit.
3.16 Basis of Limit System
The following are two bases of limit system:
1. Hole basis system. When the hole is kept as a constant member (i.e. when the lower deviation
of the hole is zero) and different fits are obtained by varying the shaft size, as shown in Fig. 3.6 (a),
then the limit system is said to be on a hole basis.
2. Shaft basis system. When the shaft is kept as a constant member (i.e. when the upper deviation
of the shaft is zero) and different fits are obtained by varying the hole size, as shown in Fig. 3.6 (b),
then the limit system is said to be on a shaft basis.
Fig. 3.6. Bases of limit system.
The hole basis and shaft basis system may also be shown as in Fig. 3.7, with respect to the
zero line.

Turbofan engines are quieter and more efficient than simple turbojet engines. Turbofans drive air
around the combustion engine as well as through it.
It may be noted that from the manufacturing point of view, a hole basis system is always preferred.
This is because the holes are usually produced and finished by standard tooling like drill, reamers,
etc., whose size is not adjustable easily. On the other hand, the size of the shaft (which is to go into the
hole) can be easily adjusted and is obtained by turning or grinding operations.
3.17 Indian Standard System of Limits and Fits
According to Indian standard [IS : 919 (Part I)-1993], the system of limits and fits comprises 18
grades of fundamental tolerances i.e. grades of accuracy of manufacture and 25 types of fundamental
deviations indicated by letter symbols for both holes and shafts (capital letter A to ZC for holes and
small letters a to zc for shafts) in diameter steps ranging from 1 to 500 mm. A unilateral hole basis
system is recommended but if necessary a unilateral or bilateral shaft basis system may also be used.
The 18 tolerance grades are designated as IT 01, IT 0 and IT 1 to IT 16. These are called standard
tolerances. The standard tolerances for grades IT 5 to IT 7 are determined in terms of standard
tolerance unit (i) in microns, where
i (microns) = 0.45 3 D  + 0.001 D, where D is the size or geometric mean diameter in mm.
The following table shows the relative magnitude for grades between IT 5 and IT 16.

The values of standard tolerances corresponding to grades IT 01, IT 0 and IT 1 are as given
below:
For IT 01, i (microns)
= 0.3 + 0.008 D,
For IT 0, i (microns)
= 0.5 + 0.012 D, and
For IT 1, i (microns)
= 0.8 + 0.020 D,
where D is the size or geometric mean diameter in mm.
The tolerance values of grades IT 2 to IT 4 are scaled approximately geometrically between
IT 1 and IT 5. The fundamental tolerances of grades IT 01, IT 0 and IT 1 to IT 16 for diameter steps
ranging from 1 to 500 mm are given in Table 3.3. The manufacturing processes capable of producing
the particular IT grades of work are shown in Table 3.4.
The alphabetical representation of fundamental deviations for basic shaft and basic hole system
is shown in Fig. 3.8.

For hole, H stands for a dimension whose lower deviation refers to the basic size. The hole H
for which the lower deviation is zero is called a basic hole. Similarly, for shafts, h stands for a
dimension whose upper deviation refers to the basic size. The shaft h for which the upper deviation is
zero is called a basic shaft.
A fit is designated by its basic size followed by symbols representing the limits of each of its
two components, the hole being quoted first. For example, 100 H6/g5 means basic size is 100 mm
and the tolerance grade for the hole is 6 and for the shaft is 5. Some of the fits commonly used in
engineering practice, for holes and shafts are shown in Tables 3.5 and 3.6 respectively according to
IS : 2709 – 1982 (Reaffirmed 1993).

3.18 Calculation of Fundamental Deviation for
Shafts
We have already discussed that for holes, the upper
deviation is denoted by ES and the lower deviation by EI.
Similarly for shafts, the upper deviation is represented by es
and the lower deviation by ei. According to Indian standards,
for each letter symbol, the magnitude and sign for one of the
two deviations (i.e. either upper or lower deviation), which is
known as fundamental deviation, have been determined by
means of formulae given in Table 3.7. The other deviation
may be calculated by using the absolute value of the standard
tolerance (IT) from the following relation:
ei = es – IT
or
 es =  ei + IT
It may be noted for shafts a to h, the upper deviations
(es) are considered whereas for shafts j to Zc, the lower
deviation (ei) is to be considered.

General rule
Hole limits are identical with the shaft limits of the
same symbol (letter and grade) but disposed on
the other side of the zero line.
EI = Upper deviation es of the shaft of the same
letter symbol but of opposite sign.
ES = 0
Special rule
ES = Lower deviation ei of the shaft of the same
letter symbol but one grade finer and of opposite
sign increased by the difference between the
tolerances of the two grades in question.

Example 3.1. The dimensions of the mating parts, according to basic hole system, are given as
follows :
Hole : 25.00 mm
Shaft : 24.97 mm
25.02 mm
24.95 mm
Find the hole tolerance, shaft tolerance and allowance.
Solution. Given : Lower limit of hole = 25 mm ; Upper limit of hole = 25.02 mm ;
Upper limit of shaft = 24.97 mm ; Lower limit of shaft = 24.95 mm
Hole tolerance
We know that hole tolerance
= Upper limit of hole – Lower limit of hole
= 25.02 – 25 = 0.02 mm Ans.
Shaft tolerance
We know that shaft tolerance
= Upper limit of shaft – Lower limit of shaft
= 24.97 – 24.95 = 0.02 mm Ans.
Allowance
We know that allowance
= Lower limit of hole – Upper limit of shaft
= 25.00 – 24.97 = 0.03 mm Ans.
Example 3.2. Calculate the tolerances, fundamental deviations and limits of sizes for the shaft
designated as 40 H8 / f7.
Solution. Given: Shaft designation = 40 H8 / f 7
The shaft designation 40 H8 / f 7 means that the basic size is 40 mm and the tolerance grade for
the hole is 8 (i.e. I T 8) and for the shaft is 7 (i.e. I T 7).
Tolerances
Since 40 mm lies in the diameter steps of 30 to 50 mm, therefore the geometric mean diameter,
D =
30
50
×
 = 38.73 mm
We know that standard tolerance unit,
i = 0.45 3 D  + 0.001 D
= 0.45 3 38.73  + 0.001 × 38.73
= 0.45 × 3.38 + 0.03873 = 1.559 73   or  1.56 microns
= 1.56 × 0.001 = 0.001 56 mm
...(Q 1 micron = 0.001 mm)
From Table 3.2, we find that standard tolerance for the hole of grade 8 (I T 8)
= 25 i = 25 × 0.001 56 = 0.039 mm Ans.
and standard tolerance for the shaft of grade 7 (I T 7)
= 16 i = 16 × 0.001 56 = 0.025 mm Ans.
Note : The value of I T 8 and I T 7 may be directly seen from Table 3.3.

Manufacturing Considerations in Machine Design      79
Fundamental deviation
We know that fundamental deviation (lower deviation) for hole H,
EI = 0
From Table 3.7, we find that fundamental deviation (upper deviation) for shaft f,
es = – 5.5 (D)0.41
= – 5.5 (38.73)0.41 = – 24.63  or – 25 microns
= – 25 × 0.001 = – 0.025 mm Ans.
∴  Fundamental deviation (lower deviation) for shaft f,
ei = es – I T = – 0.025 – 0.025 = – 0.050 mm Ans.
The –ve sign indicates that fundamental deviation lies below the zero line.
Limits of sizes
We know that lower limit for hole
= Basic size = 40 mm Ans.
Upper limit for hole = Lower limit for hole + Tolerance for hole
= 40 + 0.039 = 40.039 mm Ans.
Upper limit for shaft = Lower limit for hole or Basic size – Fundamental deviation
(upper deviation)
...(Q Shaft f lies below the zero line)
= 40 – 0.025 = 39.975 mm Ans.
and
lower limit for shaft = Upper limit for shaft – Tolerance for shaft
= 39.975 – 0.025 = 39.95 mm Ans.
Example 3.3. Give the dimensions for the hole and shaft for the following:
(a)
A 12 mm electric motor sleeve bearing;
(b)
A medium force fit on a 200 mm shaft; and
(c)
A 50 mm sleeve bearing on the elevating mechanism of a road grader.
Solution.
(a)
Dimensions for the hole and shaft for a 12 mm electric motor sleeve bearing
From Table 3.5, we find that for an electric motor sleeve bearing, a shaft e 8 should be used with
H 8 hole.
Since 12 mm size lies in the diameter steps of 10 to 18 mm, therefore the geometric mean
diameter,
D =
10
18
×
 = 13.4 mm
We know that standard tolerance unit,
i = 0.45 3 D  + 0.001 D
= 0.45 3 13.4  + 0.001 × 13.4 = 1.07 + 0.0134 = 1.0834 microns
∴ *Standard tolerance for shaft and hole of grade 8 (IT 8)
= 25 i
...(From Table 3.2)
= 25 × 1.0834 = 27 microns
= 27 × 0.001 = 0.027 mm
...(Q 1 micron = 0.001 mm)
From Table 3.7, we find that upper deviation for shaft ‘e’,
es = – 11(D)0.41 = – 11 (13.4)0.41 = – 32 microns
= – 32 × 0.001 = – 0.032 mm
*
The tolerance values may be taken directly from Table 3.3.

Dimensions for the hole and shaft for a medium force fit on a 200 mm shaft
From Table 3.5, we find that shaft r 6 with hole H 7 gives the desired fit.
Since 200 mm lies in the diameter steps of 180 mm to 250 mm, therefore the geometric mean
diameter,
D =

We know that standard tolerance unit,

Since 50 mm size lies in the diameter steps of 30 to 50 mm or 50 to 80 mm, therefore the

Example 3.4. A journal of nominal or basic size of 75 mm runs in a bearing with close running
fit. Find the limits of shaft and bearing. What is the maximum and minimum clearance?
Solution. Given: Nominal or basic size = 75 mm
From Table 3.5, we find that the close running fit is represented by H 8/g 7, i.e. a shaft g 7
should be used with H 8 hole.
Since 75 mm lies in the diameter steps of 50 to 80 mm, therefore the geometric mean diameter,
D =
50
80
×
 = 63 mm
We know that standard tolerance unit,
i = 0.45 3 D  + 0.001 D = 0.45 3 63  + 0.001 × 63
= 1.79 + 0.063 = 1.853 micron
= 1.853 × 0.001 = 0.001 853 mm
∴ Standard tolerance for hole ‘H’ of grade 8 (IT 8)
= 25 i = 25 × 0.001 853 = 0.046 mm
and standard tolerance for shaft ‘g’ of grade 7 (IT 7)
= 16 i = 16 × 0.001 853 = 0.03 mm
From Table 3.7, we find that upper deviation for shaft g,
es = – 2.5 (D)0.34 = – 2.5 (63)0.34 = – 10 micron
= – 10 × 0.001 = – 0.01 mm

82    A Textbook of Machine Design
∴ Lower deviation for shaft g,
ei = es – I T = – 0.01 – 0.03 = – 0.04 mm
We know that lower limit for hole
= Basic size = 75 mm
Upper limit for hole = Lower limit for hole + Tolerance for hole
= 75 + 0.046 = 75.046 mm
Upper limit for shaft = Lower limit for hole – Upper deviation for shaft
...(Q Shaft g lies below zero line)
= 75 – 0.01 = 74.99 mm
and
lower limit for shaft = Upper limit for shaft – Tolerance for shaft

We know that maximum clearance
= Upper limit for hole – Lower limit for shaft
= 75.046 – 74.96 = 0.086 mm Ans.

minimum clearance = Lower limit for hole – Upper limit for shaft

3.20 Surface Roughness and its
Measurement
A little consideration will show that surfaces
produced by different machining operations (e.g.
turning, milling, shaping, planing, grinding and
superfinishing) are of different characteristics. They
show marked variations when compared with each
other. The variation is judged by the degree of
smoothness. A surface produced by superfinishing
is the smoothest, while that by planing is the roughest.
In the assembly of two mating parts, it becomes
absolutely necessary to describe the surface finish
in quantitative terms which is measure of micro-
irregularities of the surface and expressed in microns.
In order to prevent stress concentrations and proper
functioning, it may be necessary to avoid or to have
certain surface roughness.
There are many ways of expressing the sur-
face roughness numerically, but the following two
methods are commonly used :
1.
Centre line average method (briefly
known as CLA method), and
2.
Root mean square method (briefly known
as RMS method).
The centre line average method is defined as
the average value of the ordinates between the
surface and the mean line, measured on both sides
of it. According to Indian standards, the surface finish
is measured in terms of ‘CLA’ value and it is denoted
by Ra.
Landing Gear : When an aircraft comes in to
land, it has to lose a lot of energy in a very
short time. the landing gear deals with this
and prevents disaster. First, mechanical  or
liquid springs absorb energy rapidly by being
compressed. As the springs relax, this energy
will be released again, but in a slow
controlled manner in a damper-the second
energy absorber. Finally, the tyres absorb
energy, getting hot in the process.

where, y1, y2, ...yn are the ordinates measured on both sides of the mean line and n are the number of

squares of the ordinates. Mathematically,

3.21 Preferred Numbers
When a machine is to be made in several sizes with different powers or capacities, it is necessary
to decide what capacities will cover a certain range efficiently with minimum number of sizes. It has
been shown by experience that a certain range can be covered efficiently when it follows a geometrical
progression with a constant ratio. The preferred numbers are the conventionally rounded off values
derived from geometric series including the integral powers of 10 and having as common ratio of the
following factors:
5
10
20
40
10,
10,
10 and
10
These ratios are approximately equal to 1.58, 1.26, 1.12 and 1.06. The series of preferred
numbers are designated as *R5, R10, R20 and R40 respectively. These four series are called basic
series. The other series called derived series may be obtained by simply multiplying or dividing the
basic sizes by 10, 100, etc. The preferred numbers in the series R5 are 1, 1.6, 2.5, 4.0 and 6.3. Table
3.12 shows basic series of preferred numbers according to IS : 1076 (Part I) – 1985 (Reaffirmed
1990).
*
The symbol R is used as a tribute to Captain Charles Renard, the first man to use preferred numbers.

Introduction
In engineering practice, the machine parts are
subjected to various forces which may be due to either one
or more of the following:
1.
Energy transmitted,
2.
Weight of machine,
3.
Frictional resistances,
4.
Inertia of reciprocating parts,
5.
Change of temperature, and
6.
Lack of balance of moving parts.
The different forces acting on a machine part produces
various types of stresses, which will be discussed in this
chapter.
4.2
Load
It is defined as any external force acting upon a
machine part. The following four types of the load are
important from the subject point of view:

2. Live or variable load. A load is said to be a live or variable load, when it changes continually.
3. Suddenly applied or shock loads. A load is said to be a suddenly applied or shock load, when
it is suddenly applied or removed.
4. Impact load. A load is said to be an impact load, when it is applied with some initial velocity.
Note: A machine part resists a dead load more easily than a live load and a live load more easily than a shock
load.

Stress
When some external system of forces or loads act on a body, the internal forces (equal and
opposite) are set up at various sections of the body, which resist the external forces. This internal
force per unit area at any section of the body is known as unit stress or simply a stress. It is denoted
by a Greek letter sigma (σ). Mathematically,
Stress, σ = P/A
where
P = Force or load acting on a body, and
A = Cross-sectional area of the body.
In S.I. units, the stress is usually expressed in Pascal (Pa) such that 1 Pa = 1 N/m2. In actual
practice, we use bigger units of stress i.e. megapascal (MPa) and gigapascal (GPa), such that
1 MPa = 1 × 106 N/m2 = 1 N/mm2
and
1 GPa = 1 × 109 N/m2 = 1 kN/mm2
4.4
Strain
When a system of forces or loads act on a body, it undergoes some deformation. This deformation
per unit length is known as unit strain or simply a strain. It is denoted by a Greek letter epsilon (ε).
Mathematically,
Strain, ε = δl / l
or
 δl = ε.l
where
δl = Change in length of the body, and
l = Original length of the body.

Tensile Stress and Strain
Fig. 4.1. Tensile stress and strain.
When a body is subjected to two equal and opposite axial pulls P (also called tensile load) as
shown in Fig. 4.1 (a), then the stress induced at any section of the body is known as tensile stress as
shown in Fig. 4.1 (b). A little consideration will show that due to the tensile load, there will be a
decrease in cross-sectional area and an increase in length of the body. The ratio of the increase in
length to the original length is known as tensile strain.

∴Tensile stress, σt = P/A

4.6
Compressive Stress and
Strain
When a body is subjected to two
equal and opposite axial pushes P (also
called compressive load) as shown in
Fig. 4.2 (a), then the stress induced at any
section of the body is known as
compressive stress as shown in Fig. 4.2
(b). A little consideration will show that
due to the compressive load, there will be
an increase in cross-sectional area and a
decrease in length of the body. The ratio
of the decrease in length to the original
length is known as compressive strain.
Fig. 4.2. Compressive stress and strain.
Let
P = Axial compressive force acting on the body,
A = Cross-sectional area of the body,
l = Original length, and
δl = Decrease in length.
∴
Compressive stress, σc = P/A
and compressive strain,
εc = δl/l
Note : In case of tension or compression, the area involved is at right angles to the external force applied.
4.7
Young's Modulus or Modulus of Elasticity

proportional to strain, i.e.

Shear Stress and Strain
When a body is subjected to two equal and opposite
forces acting tangentially across the resisting section, as a
result of which the body tends to shear off the section, then the stress induced is called shear stress.
Fig. 4.6. Single shearing of a riveted joint.
The corresponding strain is known as shear strain and it is measured by the angular deformation
accompanying the shear stress. The shear stress and shear strain are denoted by the Greek letters tau
(τ) and phi (φ) respectively. Mathematically,
Shear stress, τ = Tangential force
Resisting area
Consider a body consisting of two plates connected by a rivet as shown in Fig. 4.6 (a). In this
case, the tangential force P tends to shear off the rivet at one cross-section as shown in Fig. 4.6 (b). It
may be noted that when the tangential force is resisted by one cross-section of the rivet (or when
shearing takes place at one cross-section of the rivet), then the rivets are said to be in single shear. In
such a case, the area resisting the shear off the rivet,

Notes : 1. All lap joints and single cover butt joints are in single shear, while the butt joints with double cover
plates are in double shear.
2. In case of shear, the area involved is parallel to the external force applied.
3. When the holes are to be punched or drilled in the metal plates, then the tools used to perform the
operations must overcome the ultimate shearing resistance of the material to be cut. If a hole of diameter ‘d’ is
to be punched in a metal plate of thickness ‘t’, then the area to be sheared,
A = π d × t
and the maximum shear resistance of the tool or the force required to punch a hole,
P = A × τu = π d × t × τu

τu = Ultimate shear strength of the material of the plate.

Shear Modulus or Modulus of Rigidity
It has been found experimentally that within the elastic limit, the shear stress is directly
proportional to shear strain. Mathematically
τ ∝ φ

where
τ = Shear stress,
φ = Shear strain, and
C = Constant of proportionality, known as shear modulus or modulus
of rigidity. It is also denoted by N or G.

4.10  Bearing Stress
A localised compressive stress at the surface of contact between two members of a machine
part, that are relatively at rest is known as bearing stress or crushing stress. The bearing stress is
taken into account in the design of riveted joints, cotter joints, knuckle joints, etc. Let us consider a
riveted joint subjected to a load P as shown in Fig. 4.9. In such a case, the bearing stress or crushing
stress (stress at the surface of contact between the rivet and a plate),
σb (or σc ) =
. .
P
d t n
where
d = Diameter of the rivet,
t = Thickness of the plate,
d.t = Projected area of the rivet, and
n = Number of rivets per pitch length in bearing or crushing.
Fig. 4.9. Bearing stress in a riveted joint.
          Fig. 4.10. Bearing pressure in a journal
           supported in a bearing.
It may be noted that the local compression which exists at the surface of contact between two
members of a machine part that are in relative motion, is called bearing pressure (not the bearing
stress). This term is commonly used in the design of a journal supported in a bearing, pins for levers,
crank pins, clutch lining, etc. Let us consider a journal rotating in a fixed bearing as shown in Fig.
4.10 (a). The journal exerts a bearing pressure on the curved surfaces of the brasses immediately
below it. The distribution of this bearing pressure will not be uniform, but it will be in accordance
with the shape of the surfaces in contact and deformation characteristics of the two materials. The
distribution of bearing pressure will be similar to that as shown in Fig. 4.10 (b). Since the actual
bearing pressure is difficult to determine, therefore the average bearing pressure is usually calculated
by dividing the load to the projected area of the curved surfaces in contact. Thus, the average bearing
pressure for a journal supported in a bearing is given by
pb =
.
P
l d
where
pb = Average bearing pressure,
P = Radial load on the journal,

4.11 Stress-strain Diagram
In designing various parts of a machine, it is
necessary to know how the material will function
in service. For this, certain characteristics or
properties of the material should be known. The
mechanical properties mostly used in mechanical
engineering practice are commonly determined
from a standard tensile test. This test consists of
gradually loading a standard specimen of a material
and noting the corresponding values of load and
elongation until the specimen fractures. The load
is applied and measured by a testing machine. The
stress is determined by dividing the load values by
the original cross-sectional area of the specimen.
The elongation is measured by determining the
amounts that two reference points on the specimen
are moved apart by the action of the machine. The
original distance between the two reference points
is known as gauge length. The strain is determined
by dividing the elongation values by the gauge
length.
The values of the stress and corresponding
strain are used to draw the stress-strain diagram of the material tested. A stress-strain diagram for a
mild steel under tensile test is shown in Fig. 4.12 (a). The various properties of the material are
discussed below :
Fig. 4.11
In addition to bearing the stresses, some
machine parts are made of stainless steel to
make them corrosion resistant.

1. Proportional limit. We see from the diagram
that from point O to A is a straight line, which represents
that the stress is proportional to strain. Beyond point A,
the curve slightly deviates from the straight line. It is
thus obvious, that Hooke's law holds good up to point A
and it is known as proportional limit. It is defined as
that stress at which the stress-strain curve begins to de-
viate from the straight line.
2.  Elastic limit. It may be noted that even if the
load is increased beyond point A upto the point B, the
material will regain its shape and size when the load is
removed. This means that the material has elastic
properties up to the point B. This point is known as elastic
limit. It is defined as the stress developed in the material
without any permanent set.
Note: Since the above two limits are very close to each other,
therefore, for all practical purposes these are taken to be equal.
3. Yield point. If the material is stressed beyond
point B, the plastic stage will reach i.e. on the removal
of the load, the material will not be able to recover its
original size and shape. A little consideration will show
that beyond point B, the strain increases at a faster rate with any increase in the stress until the point
C is reached. At this point, the material yields before the load and there is an appreciable strain
without any increase in stress. In case of mild steel, it will be seen that a small load drops to D,
immediately after yielding commences. Hence there are two yield points C and D. The points C and
D are called the upper and lower yield points respectively. The stress corresponding to yield point is
known as yield point stress.
4. Ultimate stress. At D, the specimen regains some strength and higher values of stresses are
required for higher strains, than those between A and D. The stress (or load) goes on increasing till the
A crane used on a ship.

point E is reached. The gradual increase in the strain (or length) of the specimen is followed with the
uniform reduction of its cross-sectional area. The work done, during stretching the specimen, is
transformed largely into heat and the
specimen becomes hot. At E, the
stress, which attains its maximum
value is known as ultimate stress. It
is defined as the largest stress
obtained by dividing the largest value
of the load reached in a test to the
original cross-sectional area of the
test piece.
5. Breaking stress. After the
specimen has reached the ultimate
stress, a neck is formed, which
decreases the cross-sectional area of
the specimen, as shown in Fig. 4.12
(b). A little consideration will show
that the stress (or load) necessary to
break away the specimen, is less than
the maximum stress. The stress is, therefore, reduced until the specimen breaks away at point F. The
stress corresponding to point F is known as breaking stress.
Note : The breaking stress (i.e.  stress at F which is less than at E) appears to be somewhat misleading. As the
formation of a neck takes place at E which reduces the cross-sectional area, it causes the specimen suddenly
to fail at F. If for each value of the strain between E and F, the tensile load is divided by the reduced cross-
sectional area at the narrowest part of the neck, then the true stress-strain curve will follow the dotted line EG.
However, it is an established practice, to calculate strains on the basis of original cross-sectional area of the
specimen.
6. Percentage reduction in area. It is the difference between the original cross-sectional area
and cross-sectional area at the neck (i.e. where the fracture takes place). This difference is expressed
as percentage of the original cross-sectional area.
Let
A = Original cross-sectional area, and
a = Cross-sectional area at the neck.
Then
reduction in area = A – a
and
percentage reduction in area =

7. Percentage elongation. It is the percentage increase in the standard gauge length (i.e. original
length) obtained by measuring the fractured specimen after bringing the broken parts together.
Let
l = Gauge length or original length, and
L = Length of specimen after fracture or final length.
∴
Elongation = L – l

Note : The percentage elongation gives a measure of ductility of the metal under test. The amount of local
extensions depends upon the material and also on the transverse dimensions of the test piece. Since the specimens
are to be made from bars, strips, sheets, wires, forgings, castings, etc., therefore it is not possible to make all
specimens of one standard size. Since the dimensions of the specimen influence the result, therefore some
standard means of comparison of results are necessary.

As a result of series of experiments, Barba estabilished a law that in tension, similar test pieces deform
similarly and two test pieces are said to be similar if they have the same value of 
,

length and A is the cross-sectional area. A little consideration will show that the same material will give the same
percentage elongation and percentage reduction in area.
It has been found experimentally by Unwin that the general extension (up to the maximum load) is
proportional to the gauge length of the test piece and that the local extension (from maximum load to the
breaking load) is proportional to the square root of the cross-sectional area. According to Unwin's formula, the

The values of b and C are determined by finding the values of δl for two test pieces of known length (l)
and area (A).
Example 4.10. A mild steel rod of 12 mm diameter was tested for tensile strength with the
gauge length of 60 mm. Following observations were recorded :
Final length = 80 mm; Final diameter = 7 mm; Yield load = 3.4 kN and Ultimate load = 6.1 kN.
Calculate : 1. yield stress, 2. ultimate tensile stress, 3. percentage reduction in area, and
4. percentage elongation.
Solution. Given : D = 12 mm ; l = 60 mm ; L = 80 mm ; d = 7 mm ; Wy = 3.4 kN
= 3400 N; Wu = 6.1 kN = 6100 N

4.12 Working Stress
When designing machine parts, it is desirable to keep the stress lower than the maximum or
ultimate stress at which failure of the material takes place. This stress is known as the working stress
or design stress. It is also known as safe or allowable stress.
Note : By failure it is not meant actual breaking of the material. Some machine parts are said to fail when they
have plastic deformation set in them, and they no more perform their function satisfactory.
4.13 Factor of Safety
It is defined, in general, as the ratio of the maximum stress to the working stress. Mathematically,
Factor of safety =
Maximum stress
Working or design stress
In case of ductile materials e.g. mild steel, where the yield point is clearly defined, the factor of
safety is based upon the yield point stress. In such cases,
Factor of safety =
Yield point stress
Working or design stress
In case of brittle materials e.g. cast iron, the yield point is not well defined as for ductile mate-
rials. Therefore, the factor of safety for brittle materials is based on ultimate stress.
∴
Factor of safety =
Ultimate stress
Working or design stress
This relation may also be used for ductile materials.
Note: The above relations for factor of safety are for static loading.
4.14 Selection of Factor of Safety
The selection of a proper factor of safety to be used in designing any machine component
depends upon a number of considerations, such as the material, mode of manufacture, type of stress,
general service conditions and shape of the parts. Before selecting a proper factor of safety, a design
engineer should consider the following points :
1.
The reliability of the properties of the material and change of these properties during
service ;
2.
The reliability of test results and accuracy of application of these results to actual machine
parts ;
3.
The reliability of applied load ;
4.
The certainty as to exact mode of failure ;
5.
The extent of simplifying assumptions ;
6.
The extent of localised stresses ;
7.
The extent of initial stresses set up during manufacture ;
8.
The extent of loss of life if failure occurs ; and
9.
The extent of loss of property if failure occurs.
Each of the above factors must be carefully considered and evaluated. The high factor of safety
results in unnecessary risk of failure. The values of factor of safety based on ultimate strength for
different materials and type of load are given in the following table:

4.15 Stresses in Composite Bars
A composite bar may be defined as a bar made up of two or more different materials, joined
together, in such a manner that the system extends or contracts as one unit, equally, when subjected to
tension or compression. In case of composite bars, the following points should be kept in view:
1.
The extension or contraction of the bar being equal, the strain i.e. deformation per unit
length is also equal.
2.
The total external load on the bar is equal to the sum of the loads carried by different
materials.
Consider a composite bar made up of two different materials as shown in Fig. 4.13.
Let
P1 = Load carried by bar 1,
A1 = Cross-sectional area of bar 1,
σ1 = Stress produced in bar 1,
E1 = Young's modulus of bar 1,
P2, A2, σ2, E2 = Corresponding values of bar 2,
P = Total load on the composite bar,
l = Length of the composite bar, and
δl = Elongation of the composite bar.
We know that
P = P1 + P2

From the above equations, we can find out the stresses produced in the different bars. We also
know that
P = P1 + P2 = σ1.A1 + σ2.A2
From this equation, we can also find out the stresses produced in different bars.
Note : The ratio E1 / E2 is known as modular ratio of the two materials.
Example 4.11. A bar 3 m long is made of two bars, one of copper having E = 105 GN/m2 and
the other of steel having E = 210 GN/m2. Each bar is 25 mm broad and 12.5 mm thick. This compound
bar is stretched by a load of 50 kN. Find the increase in length of the compound bar and the stress
produced in the steel and copper. The length of copper as well as of steel bar is 3 m each.
Solution. Given : lc = ls = 3 m = 3 × 103 mm ; Ec = 105 GN/m2 = 105 kN/mm2 ; Es = 210 GN/m2
= 210 kN/mm2 ; b = 25 mm ; t = 12.5 mm ; P = 50 kN

Let
δl = Increase in length of the

Example 4.12. A central steel rod 18 mm diameter passes through a copper tube 24 mm inside
and 40 mm outside diameter, as shown in Fig. 4.15. It is provided with nuts and washers at each end.
The nuts are tightened until a stress of 10 MPa is set up in the steel.

4.16 Stresses due to Change in Temperature—Thermal Stresses
Whenever there is some increase or decrease in the temperature of a body, it causes the body to
expand or contract. A little consideration will show that if the body is allowed to expand or contract
freely, with the rise or fall of the temperature, no stresses are induced in the body. But, if the deformation
of the body is prevented, some stresses are induced in the body. Such stresses are known as thermal
stresses.

Let
l = Original length of the body,
t = Rise or fall of temperature, and
α = Coefficient of thermal expansion,
∴Increase or decrease in length,
δl = l. α.t
If the ends of the body are fixed to rigid supports, so that its expansion is prevented, then

Notes : 1. When a body is composed of two or different materials having different coefficient of thermal
expansions, then due to the rise in temperature, the material with higher coefficient of thermal expansion will be
subjected to compressive stress whereas the material with low coefficient of expansion will be subjected to
tensile stress.
2. When a thin tyre is shrunk on to a wheel of diameter D, its internal diameter d is a little less than the
wheel diameter. When the tyre is heated, its circumferance π d will increase to π D. In this condition, it is
slipped on to the wheel. When it cools, it wants to return to its original circumference π d, but the wheel if it is
assumed to be rigid, prevents it from doing so.

Example 4.14. A composite bar made of aluminium and steel is held between the supports as
shown in Fig. 4.16. The bars are stress free at a temperature of 37°C. What will be the stress in the
two bars when the temperature is 20°C, if (a) the supports are unyielding; and (b) the supports yield
and come nearer to each other by 0.10 mm?
It can be assumed that the change of temperature is uniform all along the length of the bar.
Take Es = 210 GPa ; Ea = 74 GPa ; αs = 11.7 × 10–6 / °C ; and αa = 23.4 × 10–6 / °C.
Fig. 4.16
Solution. Given : t1 = 37°C ; t2 = 20°C ; Es = 210 GPa = 210 × 109 N/m2 ; Ea = 74 GPa
= 74 × 109 N/m2 ; αs = 11.7 × 10–6 / °C ; αa = 23.4 × 10–6 / °C , ds = 50 mm = 0.05 m ; da = 25 mm
= 0.025 m ; ls = 600 mm = 0.6 m ; la = 300 mm = 0.3 m
Let us assume that the right support at B is removed and the bar is allowed to contract freely due
to the fall in temperature. We know that the fall in temperature,
t = t1 –  t2 = 37 – 20 = 17°C
∴ Contraction in steel bar
= αs . ls . t = 11.7 × 10–6 × 600 × 17 = 0.12 mm
and contraction in aluminium bar
= αa . la . t = 23.4 × 10–6 × 300 × 17 = 0.12 mm
Total contraction = 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24 mm = 0.24 × 10–3 m
It may be noted that even after this contraction (i.e. 0.24 mm) in length, the bar is still stress free
as the right hand end was assumed free.

(a) When the supports are unyielding
When the supports are unyielding, the total contraction is equated to the total elongation,i.e.
0.24 × 10–3 = 9.712 × 10–9P     or
 P = 24 712 N
∴ Stress in the steel bar,
σs = P/As = 24 712 / (1.964 × 10–3) = 12 582 × 103 N/m2
= 12.582 MPa
Ans.
and stress in the aluminium bar,

Ans.
(b) When the supports yield by 0.1 mm
When the supports yield and come nearer to each other by 0.10 mm, the net contraction in

Equating this net contraction to the total elongation, we have

∴ Stress in the steel bar,

Example 4.15. A copper bar 50 mm in diameter is placed within a steel tube 75 mm external
diameter and 50 mm internal diameter of exactly the same length. The two pieces are rigidly fixed
together by two pins 18 mm in diameter, one at each end passing through the bar and tube. Calculate
the stress induced in the copper bar, steel tube and pins if the temperature of the combination is
raised by 50°C. Take Es = 210 GN/m2 ; Ec = 105 GN/m2 ; αs = 11.5 × 10–6/°C and αc = 17 × 10–6/°C.
Solution. Given: dc = 50 mm ; dse = 75 mm ; dsi = 50 mm ; dp = 18 mm = 0.018 m ;
t = 50°C; Es = 210 GN/m2 = 210 × 109 N/m2 ; Ec = 105 GN/m2 = 105 × 109 N/m2 ;

Since the free expansion of the
copper bar is more than the free expansion
of the steel tube, therefore the copper bar
is subjected to a *compressive stress,
while the steel tube is subjected to a
tensile stress.
Let a compressive force P newton
on the copper bar opposes the extra
expansion of the copper bar and an equal
tensile force P on the steel tube pulls the
steel tube so that the net effect of
reduction in length of copper bar and the
increase in length of steel tube equalises
the difference in free expansion of the
two.

Stress induced in the copper bar, steel tube and pins
We know that stress induced in the copper bar,
σc = P / Ac = 40 500 / (1964 × 10–6) = 20.62 × 106 N/m2 = 20.62 MPa Ans.
Stress induced in the steel tube,

In other words, we can also say that since the coefficient of thermal expansion for copper (αc) is more than
the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel (αs), therefore the copper bar will be subjected to compressive
stress and the steel tube will be subjected to tensile stress.

4.17 Linear and Lateral Strain
Consider a circular bar of diameter d and length l, subjected to a tensile force P as shown in
Fig. 4.19 (a).
Fig. 4.19. Linear and lateral strain.
A little consideration will show that due to tensile force, the length of the bar increases by an
amount δl and the diameter decreases by an amount δd, as shown in Fig. 4.19 (b). Similarly, if the bar
is subjected to a compressive force, the length of bar will decrease which will be followed by increase
in diameter.
It is thus obvious, that every direct stress is accompanied by a strain in its own direction which
is known as linear strain and an opposite kind of strain in every direction, at right angles to it, is
known as lateral strain.
4.18 Poisson's Ratio
It has been found experimentally that when a body is stressed within elastic limit, the lateral
strain bears a constant ratio to the linear strain, Mathematically,
Lateral strain
Linear strain = Constant
This constant is known as Poisson's ratio and is denoted by 1/m or μ.
Following are the values of Poisson's ratio for some of the materials commonly used in engineering
practice.

4.19 Volumetric Strain
When a body is subjected to a system of forces, it undergoes some changes in its dimensions. In
other words, the volume of the body is changed. The ratio of the change in volume to the original
volume is known as volumetric strain. Mathematically, volumetric strain,
εv = δV / V
where
δV = Change in volume, and V = Original volume.

2. Volumetric strain of a rectangular body subjected to three mutually perpendicular forces is given by
εv = εx + εy + εz
where εx, εy and εz are the strains in the directions x-axis, y-axis and z-axis respectively.
4.20 Bulk Modulus
When a body is subjected to three mutually perpendicular stresses, of equal intensity, then the
ratio of the direct stress to the corresponding volumetric strain is known as bulk modulus. It is
usually denoted by K. Mathematically, bulk modulus,

4.23 Impact Stress
Sometimes, machine members are subjected to the load
with impact. The stress produced in the member due to the falling
load is known as impact stress.
Consider a bar carrying a load W at a height h and falling
on the collar provided at the lower end, as shown in Fig. 4.20.
Let  A = Cross-sectional area of the bar,
E = Young's modulus of the material of the bar,
 l = Length of the bar,
δl = Deformation of the bar,
P = Force at which the deflection δl is produced,

4.24 Resilience
When a body is loaded within elastic limit, it changes its dimensions and on the removal of the
load, it regains its original dimensions. So long as it remains loaded, it has stored energy in itself. On
removing the load, the energy stored is given off as in the case of a spring. This energy, which is
absorbed in a body when strained within elastic limit, is known as strain energy. The strain energy is
always capable of doing some work.
The strain energy stored in a body due to external loading, within elastic limit, is known as
resilience and the maximum energy which can be stored in a body up to the elastic limit is called
proof resilience. The proof resilience per unit volume of a material is known as modulus of resil-
ience. It is an important property of a material and gives capacity of the material to bear impact or
shocks. Mathematically, strain energy stored in a body due to tensile or compressive load or resil-
ience,

Introduction
Sometimes machine parts are subjected to pure
torsion or bending or combination of both torsion and
bending stresses. We shall now discuss these stresses in
detail in the following pages.
5.2
Torsional Shear Stress
When a machine member is subjected to the action
of two equal and opposite couples acting in parallel planes
(or torque or twisting moment), then the machine member
is said to be subjected to torsion. The stress set up by torsion
is known as torsional shear stress. It is zero at the centroidal
axis and maximum at the outer surface.
Consider a shaft fixed at one end and subjected to a
torque (T) at the other end as shown in Fig. 5.1. As a result
of this torque, every cross-section of the shaft is subjected
to torsional shear stress. We have discussed above that the
Contents
Top
Torsional and Bending Stresses in Machine Parts     121
torsional shear stress is zero at the centroidal axis and maximum at the outer surface. The
maximum torsional shear stress at the outer surface of the shaft may be obtained from the following
equation:
.
T
C
r
J
l
τ
θ
=
=
...(i)
where
τ = Torsional shear stress induced at the outer surface of the shaft or maximum
shear stress,
r = Radius of the shaft,
T = Torque or twisting moment,
J = Second moment of area of the section about its polar axis or polar moment of
inertia,
C = Modulus of rigidity for the shaft material,
l = Length of the shaft, and
θ = Angle of twist in radians on a length l.
Fig. 5.1. Torsional shear stress.
The equation (i) is known as torsion equation. It is based on the following assumptions:
1. The material of the shaft is uniform throughout.
2. The twist along the length of the shaft is uniform.
3. The normal cross-sections of the shaft, which were plane and circular before twist, remain
plane and circular after twist.
4. All diameters of the normal cross-section which were straight before twist, remain straight
with their magnitude unchanged, after twist.
5. The maximum shear stress induced in the shaft due to the twisting moment does not exceed
its elastic limit value.
Notes : 1. Since the torsional shear stress on any cross-section normal to the axis is directly proportional to the
distance from the centre of the axis, therefore the torsional shear stress at a distance x from the centre of the shaft
is given by

Solution. Given : P = 100 kW = 100 × 103 W ; N = 160 r.p.m ; Tmax = 1.25 Tmean ; τ = 70 MPa
= 70 N/mm2
Let
      Tmean =  Mean torque transmitted by the shaft in N-m, and

and maximum torque transmitted,

Example 5.2. A steel shaft 35 mm in diameter and 1.2 m long held rigidly at one end has a
hand wheel 500 mm in diameter keyed to the other end. The modulus of rigidity of steel is 80 GPa.
1. What load applied to tangent to the rim of the wheel produce a torsional shear of 60 MPa?
2. How many degrees will the wheel turn when this load is applied?
Solution. Given : d = 35 mm or r = 17.5 mm ; l = 1.2 m = 1200 mm ; D = 500 mm or
R = 250 mm ; C = 80 GPa = 80 kN/mm2 = 80 × 103 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2

material is 60 MPa, find the suitable diameter for the shaft. The shaft is not to twist more that 1° in
a length of 3 metres. Take C = 80 GPa.
Solution. Given : P = 97.5 kW = 97.5 × 103 W ; N = 180 r.p.m. ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ;
θ = 1° = π / 180 = 0.0174 rad ; l = 3 m = 3000 mm ; C = 80 GPa = 80 × 109 N/m2 = 80 × 103 N/mm2

Example 5.4. A hollow shaft is required to transmit 600 kW at 110 r.p.m., the maximum torque

3 metres not to exceed 1.4 degrees. Find the external diameter of the shaft, if the internal diameter to
the external diameter is 3/8. Take modulus of rigidity as 84 GPa.
Solution. Given : P = 600 kW = 600 × 103 W ; N = 110 r.p.m. ; Tmax = 1.2 Tmean ; τ = 63 MPa
= 63 N/mm2 ; l = 3 m = 3000 mm ; θ = 1.4 × π / 180 = 0.024 rad ; k = di / do = 3/8 ; C = 84 GPa

Shafts in Series and Parallel
When two shafts of different diameters are connected together to form one shaft, it is then
known as composite shaft. If the driving torque is applied at one end and the resisting torque at the
other end, then the shafts are said to be connected in series as shown in Fig. 5.2 (a). In such cases,
each shaft transmits the same torque and the total angle of twist is equal to the sum of the angle of
twists of the two shafts.

Example 5.5.  A steel shaft ABCD having a total length of 3.5 m consists of three lengths
having different sections as follows:
AB is hollow having outside and inside diameters of 100 mm and 62.5 mm respectively, and BC
and CD are solid. BC has a diameter of 100 mm and CD has a diameter of 87.5 mm. If the angle of
twist is the same for each section, determine the length of each section. Find the value of the applied
torque and the total angle of twist, if the maximum shear stress in the hollow portion is 47.5 MPa and
shear modulus, C = 82.5 GPa.
Solution. Given: L = 3.5 m ; do = 100 mm ; di = 62.5 mm ; d2 = 100 mm ; d3 = 87.5 mm ;
τ = 47.5 MPa = 47.5 N/mm2 ; C = 82.5 GPa = 82.5 × 103 N/mm2
The shaft ABCD is shown in Fig. 5.3.

Length of each section
Let                  l1,  l2 and l3 = Length of sections AB, BC and CD respectively.
We know that polar moment of inertia of the hollow shaft AB,
J1 = 32
π  [(do)4 – (di)4] = 32
π
 [(100)4 – (62.5)4] = 8.32 × 106 mm4
Polar moment of inertia of the solid shaft BC,
J2 = 32
π  (d2)4 = 32

and polar moment of inertia of the solid shaft CD,
J3 = 32
π  (d3)4 = 32
π  (87.5)4 = 5.75 × 106 mm4
We also know that angle of twist,
θ = T . l / C . J
Assuming the torque T and shear modulus C to
be same for all the sections, we have
Angle of twist for hollow shaft AB,
θ1 = T . l1 / C . J1
Similarly, angle of twist for solid shaft BC,
θ2 = T . l2 / C . J2
and angle of twist for solid shaft CD,
θ3 = T . l3 / C . J3
Since the angle of twist is same for each section,
therefore
θ1 = θ2

twists of the individual shafts. Mathematically, the total angle of twist,

Bending Stress in Straight Beams
In engineering practice, the machine parts of structural members may be subjected to static or
dynamic loads which cause bending stress in the sections besides other types of stresses such as
tensile, compressive and shearing stresses.
Consider a straight beam subjected to a bending moment M as shown in Fig. 5.4. The following
assumptions are usually made while deriving the bending formula.
1.
The material of the beam is perfectly homogeneous (i.e. of the same material throughout)
and isotropic (i.e. of equal elastic properties in all directions).
2.
The material of the beam obeys Hooke’s law.
3.
The transverse sections (i.e. BC or GH) which were plane before bending, remain plane
after bending also.
4.
Each layer of the beam is free to expand or contract, independently, of the layer, above or
below it.
5.
The Young’s modulus (E) is the same in tension and compression.
6.
The loads are applied in the plane of bending.
Fig. 5.4. Bending stress in straight beams.
A little consideration will show that when a beam is subjected to the bending moment, the fibres
on the upper side of the beam will be shortened due to compression and those on the lower side will
be elongated due to tension. It may be seen that somewhere between the top and bottom fibres there
is a surface at which the fibres are neither shortened nor lengthened. Such a surface is called neutral
surface. The intersection of the neutral surface with any normal cross-section of the beam is known
as neutral axis. The stress distribution of a beam is shown in Fig. 5.4. The bending equation is given
by
M

σ =
where
M = Bending moment acting at the given section,
σ = Bending stress,

Parts in  a machine.
I = Moment of inertia of the cross-section about the neutral axis,
y = Distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fibre,
E = Young’s modulus of the material of the beam, and
R = Radius of curvature of the beam.
From the above equation, the bending stress is given by
σ =
E

R
×
Since E and R are constant, therefore within elastic limit, the stress at any point is directly
proportional to y, i.e. the distance of the point from the neutral axis.

The ratio I/y is known as section modulus and is denoted by Z.
Notes : 1.
The neutral axis of a
section always passes through its
centroid.
2. In case of symmetrical
sections such as circular, square or
rectangular, the neutral axis passes
through its geometrical centre and
the distance of extreme fibre from
the neutral axis is y = d / 2, where d
is the diameter in case of circular
section or depth in case of square or
rectangular section.
3. In case of unsymmetrical
sections such as L-section or T-
section, the neutral axis does not
pass through its geometrical centre.
In such cases, first of all the centroid
of the section is calculated and then
the distance of the extreme fibres for
both lower and upper side of the
section is obtained. Out of these two values, the bigger value is used in bending equation.
Table 5.1 (from pages 130 to 134) shows the properties of some common cross-sections.
This is the first revolver produced in a production line using interchangeable parts.

Torsional and Bending Stresses in Machine Parts     135
Example 5.6. A pump lever rocking shaft is shown in Fig. 5.5. The pump lever exerts forces of
25 kN and 35 kN concentrated at 150 mm and 200 mm from the left and right hand bearing respec-
tively. Find the diameter of the central portion of the shaft, if the stress is not to exceed 100 MPa.
Fig. 5.5
Solution. Given :
σb = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2
Let
RA and RB = Reactions at A and B respectively.
Taking moments about A, we have
RB × 950 = 35 × 750 + 25 × 150 = 30 000
∴
RB = 30 000 / 950 = 31.58 kN = 31.58 × 103 N
and
RA = (25 + 35) – 31.58 = 28.42 kN = 28.42 × 103 N
∴Bending moment at C
= RA × 150 = 28.42 × 103 × 150 = 4.263 × 106 N-mm
and
bending moment at
D = RB × 200 = 31.58 × 103 × 200 = 6.316 × 106 N-mm
We see that the maximum bending moment
is at D, therefore maximum bending moment, M
= 6.316 × 106 N-mm.
Let
d = Diameter of the
shaft.
∴ Section modulus,
Z = 32

30 kN at the centre. If the stress (bending) is not to exceed 60 MPa, find the diameter of the axle.
Solution. Given : L = 1 m = 1000 mm ; W = 30 kN = 30 × 103 N ; σb = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2
The axle with a flywheel is shown in Fig. 5.6.
Let

Example 5.9. A cast iron pulley transmits 10 kW at 400 r.p.m. The diameter of the pulley is 1.2

minor axis. Determine the dimensions of the arm if the allowable bending stress is 15 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 10 kW = 10 × 103 W ; N = 400 r.p.m ; D = 1.2 m = 1200 mm or
R = 600 mm ; σb = 15 MPa = 15 N/mm2
Let
T = Torque transmitted by the pulley.

Bending Stress in Curved Beams
We have seen in the previous article that for the straight beams, the neutral axis of the section
coincides with its centroidal axis and the stress distribution in the beam is linear. But in case of curved
beams, the neutral axis of the cross-section is shifted towards the centre of curvature of the beam
causing a non-linear (hyperbolic) distribution of stress, as shown in Fig. 5.8. It may be noted that the
neutral axis lies between the centroidal axis and the centre of curvature and always occurs within the
curved beams. The application of curved beam principle is used in crane hooks, chain links and
frames of punches, presses, planers etc.
Fig. 5.8. Bending stress in a curved beam.
Consider a curved beam subjected to a bending moment M, as shown in Fig. 5.8. In finding the
bending stress in curved beams, the same assumptions are used as for straight beams. The general
expression for the bending stress (σb) in a curved beam at any fibre at a distance y from the neutral

where
M = Bending moment acting at the given section about the centroidal
axis,
A = Area of cross-section,
e = Distance from the centroidal axis to the neutral axis = R – Rn,
R = Radius of curvature of the centroidal axis,
Rn = Radius of curvature of the neutral axis, and
y = Distance from the neutral axis to the fibre under consideration. It is
positive for the distances towards the centre of curvature and
negative for the distances away from the centre of curvature.
Notes : 1. The bending stress in the curved beam is zero at a point other than at the centroidal axis.
2. If the section is symmetrical such as a circle, rectangle, I-beam with equal flanges, then the maximum
bending stress will always occur at the inside fibre.
3. If the section is unsymmetrical, then the maximum bending stress may occur at either the inside fibre
or the outside fibre. The maximum bending stress at the inside fibre is given by

It may be noted that the bending stress at the inside fibre is tensile while the bending stress at the outside
fibre is compressive.
4. If the section has an axial load in addition to bending, then the axial or direct stress (σd) must be added
algebraically to the bending stress, in order to obtain the resultant stress on the section. In other words,
Resultant stress,
σ = σd ± σb

∴   Bending moment about the centroidal axis,

The section at X-X is subjected to a direct tensile load of W and a bending moment of 83.2 W.

at outer fibre is compressive.

Principal Stresses and Principal Planes
In the previous chapter, we have discussed about the direct tensile and compressive stress as
well as simple shear. Also we have always referred the stress in a plane which is at right angles to the
line of action of the force.
But it has been observed
that at any point in a
strained material, there are
three planes, mutually
perpendicular to each
other which carry direct
stresses only and no shear
stress. It may be noted that
out of these three direct
stresses, one will be
maximum and the other
will be minimum. These
perpendicular 
planes
which have no shear stress
are known as principal
planes and the direct
stresses along these planes
are known as principal
stresses. The planes on
which the maximum shear
stress act are known as planes of maximum shear.

Determination of Principal Stresses for a Member Subjected to Bi-axial
Stress
When a member is subjected to bi-axial stress (i.e. direct stress in two mutually perpendicular
planes accompanied by a simple shear stress), then the normal and shear stresses are obtained as
discussed below:
Consider a rectangular body ABCD of uniform cross-sectional area and unit thickness subjected
to normal stresses σ1 and σ2 as shown in Fig. 5.15 (a). In addition to these normal stresses, a shear
stress τ also acts.
It has been shown in books on ‘Strength of Materials’ that the normal stress across any oblique
section such as EF inclined at an angle θ with the direction of σ2, as shown in Fig. 5.15 (a), is given by
σt =
1
2
1
2 cos 2
sin 2
2
2
σ + σ
σ + σ

θ + τ
θ
...(i)
and tangential stress (i.e. shear stress) across the section EF,
τ1 = 1
2  (σ1 – σ2) sin 2θ – τ cos 2θ
...(ii)
Since the planes of maximum and minimum normal stress (i.e. principal planes) have no
shear stress, therefore the inclination of principal planes is obtained by equating τ1 = 0 in the above
equation (ii), i.e.
         1
2
 (σ1 – σ2) sin 2θ – τ cos 2θ = 0
∴                                            tan 2θ =

We know that there are two principal planes at right angles to each other. Let θ1 and θ2 be the
inclinations of these planes with the normal cross-section.

Application of  Principal Stresses in Designing Machine Members
There are many cases in practice, in which machine members are subjected to combined stresses
due to simultaneous action of either tensile or compressive stresses combined with shear stresses. In
many shafts such as propeller shafts, C-frames etc., there are direct tensile or compressive stresses
due to the external force and shear stress due to torsion, which acts normal to direct tensile or com-
pressive stresses. The shafts like crank shafts, are subjected simultaneously to torsion and bending. In
such cases, the maximum principal stresses, due to the combination of tensile or compressive stresses
with shear stresses may be obtained.
The results obtained in the previous article may be written as follows:

where
σt = Tensile stress due to direct load and bending,
σc = Compressive stress, and
τ = Shear stress due to torsion.
Notes : 1. When τ = 0 as in the case of thin cylindrical shell subjected in internal fluid pressure, then
σt (max) = σt
2. When the shaft is subjected to an axial load (P) in addition to bending and twisting moments as in the
propeller shafts of ship and shafts for driving worm gears, then the stress due to axial load must be added to the
bending stress (σb). This will give the resultant tensile stress or compressive stress (σt or σc) depending upon the
type of axial load (i.e. pull or push).
Example 5.13. A hollow shaft of 40 mm outer diameter and 25 mm inner diameter is subjected
to a twisting moment of 120 N-m, simultaneously, it is subjected to an axial thrust of 10 kN and a
bending moment of 80 N-m. Calculate the maximum compressive and shear stresses.
Solution. Given: do = 40 mm ; di = 25 mm ; T = 120 N-m = 120 × 103 N-mm ; P = 10 kN
= 10 × 103 N ; M = 80 N-m = 80 × 103 N-mm

Theories of Failure Under Static Load
It has already been discussed in the previous chapter that strength of machine members is based
upon the mechanical properties of the materials used. Since these properties are usually determined
from simple tension or compression tests, therefore, predicting failure in members subjected to uni-
axial stress is both simple and straight-forward. But the problem of predicting the failure stresses for
members subjected to bi-axial or tri-axial stresses is much more complicated. In fact, the problem is
so complicated that a large number of different theories have been formulated. The principal theories
of failure for a member subjected to bi-axial stress are as follows:
1. Maximum principal (or normal) stress theory (also known as Rankine’s theory).
2. Maximum shear stress theory (also known as Guest’s or Tresca’s theory).
3. Maximum principal (or normal) strain theory (also known as Saint Venant theory).
4. Maximum strain energy theory (also known as Haigh’s theory).
5. Maximum distortion energy theory (also known as Hencky and Von Mises theory).
Since ductile materials usually fail by yielding i.e. when permanent deformations occur in the
material and brittle materials fail by fracture, therefore the limiting strength for these two classes of
materials is normally measured by different mechanical properties. For ductile materials, the limiting
strength is the stress at yield point as determined from simple tension test and it is, assumed to be
equal in tension or compression. For brittle materials, the limiting strength is the ultimate stress in
tension or compression.
5.10 Maximum Principal or Normal Stress Theory (Rankine’s Theory)
According to this theory, the failure or yielding occurs at a point in a member when the maximum
principal or normal stress in a bi-axial stress system reaches the limiting strength of the material in a
simple tension test.
Since the limiting strength for ductile materials is yield point stress and for brittle materials
(which do not have well defined yield point) the limiting strength is ultimate stress, therefore according

where
σyt = Yield point stress in tension as determined from simple tension

Since the maximum principal or normal stress theory is based on failure in tension or compression
and ignores the possibility of failure due to shearing stress, therefore it is not used for ductile materials.
However, for brittle materials which are relatively strong in shear but weak in tension or compression,
this theory is generally used.
Note : The value of maximum principal stress (σt1) for a member subjected to bi-axial stress system may be
determined as discussed in Art. 5.7.
5.11 Maximum Shear Stress Theory (Guest’s or Tresca’s Theory)
According to this theory, the failure or yielding occurs at a point in a member when the maximum
shear stress in a bi-axial stress system reaches a value equal to the shear stress at yield point in a
simple tension test. Mathematically,
τmax = τyt /F.S.
...(i)
where
τmax = Maximum shear stress in a bi-axial stress system,
τyt = Shear stress at yield point as determined from simple tension test,
and
F.S. = Factor of safety.
Since the shear stress at yield point in a simple tension test is equal to one-half the yield stress
in tension, therefore the equation (i) may be written as

According to this theory, the failure or yielding occurs at a point in a member when the maximum
principal (or normal) strain in a bi-axial stress system reaches the limiting value of strain (i.e. strain at
yield point) as determined from a simple tensile test. The maximum principal (or normal) strain in a

Torsional and Bending Stresses in Machine Parts     157
Example 5.17. A cylindrical shaft made of steel of yield strength 700 MPa is subjected to static
loads consisting of bending moment 10 kN-m and a torsional moment 30 kN-m. Determine the diameter
of the shaft using two different theories of failure, and assuming a factor of safety of 2. Take E = 210
GPa and poisson's ratio = 0.25.
Solution. Given : σyt = 700 MPa = 700 N/mm2 ; M = 10 kN-m = 10 × 106 N-mm ; T = 30 kN-m
= 30 × 106 N-mm ; F.S. = 2 ; E = 210 GPa = 210 × 103 N/mm2 ; 1/m = 0.25
Let
d = Diameter of the shaft in mm.
First of all, let us find the maximum and minimum principal stresses.
We know that section modulus of the shaft
Z = 32

Example 5.18. A mild steel shaft of 50 mm diameter is subjected to a bending moment of 2000
N-m and a torque T. If the yield point of the steel in tension is 200 MPa, find the maximum value of
this torque without causing yielding of the shaft according to 1. the maximum principal stress; 2. the
maximum shear stress; and 3. the maximum distortion strain energy theory of yielding.
Solution. Given: d = 50 mm ; M = 2000 N-m = 2 × 106 N-mm ; σyt = 200 MPa = 200 N/mm2
Let
T = Maximum torque without causing yielding of the shaft, in N-mm.

of the machine component, is known as an eccentric load. The distance between the centroidal axis
of the machine component and the eccentric load is called eccentricity and is generally denoted by e.
The examples of eccentric loading, from the subject point of view, are C-clamps, punching machines,
brackets, offset connecting links etc.
Fig. 5.19. Eccentric loading.
Consider a short prismatic bar subjected to a compressive load P acting at an eccentricity of e as
shown in Fig. 5.19 (a).
Let us introduce two forces P1 and P2 along the centre line or neutral axis equal in magnitude to
P, without altering the equilibrium of the bar as shown in Fig. 5.19 (b). A little consideration will
show that the force P1 will induce a direct compressive stress over the entire cross-section of the bar,
as shown in Fig. 5.19 (c).
The magnitude of this direct compressive stress is given by
σo =
1P
A  or P
A , where A is the cross-sectional area of the bar.
The forces P1 and P2 will form a couple equal to P × e which will cause bending stress. This
bending stress is compressive at the edge AB and tensile at the edge CD, as shown in Fig. 5.19 (d).
The magnitude of bending stress at the edge AB is given by

The resultant compressive and tensile stress diagram is shown in Fig. 5.19 (e).
Notes: 1. When the member is subjected to a tensile load, then the
above equations may be used by interchanging the subscripts c and t.
2. When the direct stress σo is greater than or equal to bending
stress σb, then the compressive stress shall be present all over the
cross-section.
3. When the direct stress σo is less than the bending stress σb,
then the tensile stress will occur in the left hand portion of the cross-
section and compressive stress on the right hand portion of the cross-
section. In Fig. 5.19, the stress diagrams are drawn by taking σo less
than σb.
In case the eccentric load acts with eccentricity about two axes,

Example 5.19. A rectangular strut is 150 mm wide and 120 mm thick. It carries a load of 180
kN at an eccentricity of 10 mm in a plane bisecting the thickness as shown in Fig. 5.21. Find the
maximum and minimum intensities of stress in the section.
Solution. Given : b = 150 mm ; d = 120 mm ; P = 180 kN
= 180 × 103 N ; e = 10 mm
We know that cross-sectional area of the strut,

Since σo is greater than σb, therefore the entire cross-section of the strut will be subjected to
compressive stress. The maximum intensity of compressive stress will be at the edge AB and
minimum at the edge CD.
∴ Maximum intensity of compressive stress at the edge AB
= σo + σb = 10 + 4 = 14 MPa Ans.
and
minimum intensity of compressive stress at the edge CD
= σo – σb = 10 – 4 = 6 MPa Ans.
Example 5.20. A hollow circular column of external diameter
250 mm and internal diameter 200 mm, carries a projecting bracket
on which a load of 20 kN rests, as shown in Fig. 5.22. The centre of
the load from the centre of the column is 500 mm. Find the stresses
at the sides of the column.
Solution. Given : D = 250 mm ; d = 200 mm ;
P = 20 kN = 20 × 103 N ; e = 500 mm
We know that cross-sectional area of column,

Example 5.22. A mild steel link, as shown in Fig. 5.24 by full lines, transmits a pull of 80 kN.
Find the dimensions b and t if b = 3t.
Assume the permissible tensile stress as
70 MPa. If the original link is replaced
by an unsymmetrical one, as shown by
dotted lines in Fig. 5.24, having the same
thickness t, find the depth b1, using the
same permissible stress as before.
Solution. Given : P = 80 kN
= 80 × 103 N ; σt = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2
When the link is in the position shown by full lines in Fig. 5.24, the area of cross-section,
A = b × t = 3 t × t = 3 t 2
...(Q b = 3t )
We know that tensile load (P),
80 × 103 = σt × A = 70 × 3 t2 = 210 t2
∴
t2 = 80 × 103 / 210 = 381  or  t = 19.5 say 20 mm Ans.
and
b = 3 t = 3 × 20 = 60 mm Ans.
When the link is in the position shown by dotted lines, it will be subjected to direct stress as well
as bending stress. We know that area of cross-section,
A1 = b1 × t

Example 5.23. A cast-iron link, as shown in Fig. 5.25, is to carry a load of 20 kN. If the tensile
and compressive stresses in the link are not to exceed 25 MPa and 80 MPa respectively, obtain the
dimensions of the cross-section of the link at the middle of its length.
Fig. 5.25
Solution. Given : P = 20 kN = 20 × 103 N ; σt(max) = 25 MPa = 25 N/mm2 ; σc(max) = 80 MPa
= 80 N/mm2
Since the link is subjected to eccentric loading, therefore there
will be direct tensile stress as well as bending stress. The bending
stress at the bottom of the link is tensile and in the upper portion is
compressive.
We know that cross-sectional area of the link,
A = 3a × a + 2 × 2

Solution. Given : Horizontal pull, P = 5 kN = 5000 N
Since the section is subjected to eccentric loading, therefore there will be direct tensile stress as
well as bending stress. The bending stress at the flange is tensile and in the web is compressive.
We know that cross-sectional area of the section,

Stresses at section Y-Y
Since the cross-section of frame is uniform throughout, therefore cross-sectional area of the
frame at section Y-Y,
A = b sec 45° × t = 77 × 1.414 × 38.5 = 4192 mm2
Component of the load perpendicular to the section
= P cos 45° = 25 × 103 × 0.707 = 17 675 N
This component of the load produces uniform tensile stress over the section.
∴ Uniform tensile stress over the section,
σ = 17 675 / 4192 = 4.2 N/mm2 = 4.2 MPa
Component of the load parallel to the section
= P sin 45° = 25 × 103 × 0.707 = 17 675 N
This component of the load produces uniform shear stress over the section.
∴ Uniform shear stress over the section,

5.16 Shear Stresses in Beams
In the previous article, we have assumed that no shear force is acting on the section. But, in
actual practice, when a beam is loaded, the shear force at a section always comes into play along with
the bending moment. It has been observed that the effect of the shear stress, as compared to the
bending stress, is quite negligible and is of not much importance. But, sometimes, the shear stress at
a section is of much importance in the design. It may be noted that the shear stress in a beam is not
uniformly distributed over the cross-section but varies from zero at the outer fibres to a maximum at
the neutral surface as shown in Fig. 5.30 and Fig. 5.31.
Fig. 5.30. Shear stress in a rectangular beam.
Fig. 5.31. Shear stress in a circular beam.
The shear stress at any section acts in a plane at right angle to the plane of the bending stress and
its value is given by

Introduction
We have discussed, in the previous chapter, the
stresses due to static loading only. But only a few machine
parts are subjected to static loading. Since many of the
machine parts (such as axles, shafts, crankshafts, connecting
rods, springs, pinion teeth etc.) are subjected to variable or
alternating loads (also known as fluctuating or fatigue
loads), therefore we shall discuss, in this chapter, the
variable or alternating stresses.
6.2
Completely Reversed or Cyclic Stresses
Consider a rotating beam of circular cross-section
and carrying a load W, as shown in Fig. 6.1. This load
induces stresses in the beam which are cyclic in nature. A
little consideration will show that the upper fibres of the
beam (i.e. at point A) are under compressive stress and the
lower fibres (i.e. at point B) are under tensile stress. After
Contents

182    A Textbook of Machine Design
half a revolution, the point B occupies the position of
point A and the point A occupies the position of point B.
Thus the point B is now under compressive stress and
the point A under tensile stress. The speed of variation
of these stresses depends upon the speed of the beam.
From above we see that for each revolution of the
beam, the stresses are reversed from compressive to tensile.
The stresses which vary from one value of compressive to
the same value of tensile or vice versa, are known as completely reversed or cyclic stresses.
Notes: 1. The stresses which vary from a minimum value to a maximum value of the same nature, (i.e. tensile or
compressive) are called fluctuating stresses.
2. The stresses which vary from zero to a certain maximum value are called repeated stresses.
3. The stresses which vary from a minimum value to a maximum value of the opposite nature (i.e. from a
certain minimum compressive to a certain maximum tensile or from a minimum tensile to a maximum compressive)
are called alternating stresses.
6.3
Fatigue and Endurance Limit
It has been found experimentally that when a material is subjected to repeated stresses, it fails at
stresses below the yield point stresses. Such type of failure of a material is known as fatigue. The
failure is caused by means of a progressive crack formation which are usually fine and of microscopic
size. The failure may occur even without any prior indication. The fatigue of material is effected by
the size of the component, relative magnitude of static and fluctuating loads and the number of load
reversals.
Fig. 6.2. Time-stress diagrams.
In order to study the effect of fatigue of a material, a rotating mirror beam method is used. In
this method, a standard mirror polished specimen, as shown in Fig. 6.2 (a), is rotated in a fatigue
Fig. 6.1. Reversed or cyclic stresses.
Contents

Variable Stresses in Machine Parts     183
testing machine while the specimen is loaded
in bending. As the specimen rotates, the
bending stress at the upper fibres varies from
maximum compressive to maximum tensile
while the bending stress at the lower fibres
varies from maximum tensile to maximum
compressive. In other words, the specimen is
subjected to a completely reversed stress cycle.
This is represented by a time-stress diagram
as shown in Fig. 6.2 (b). A record is kept of
the number of cycles required to produce
failure at a given stress, and the results are
plotted in stress-cycle curve as shown in Fig.
6.2 (c). A little consideration will show that if
the stress is kept below a certain value as shown
by dotted line in Fig. 6.2 (c), the material will not fail whatever may be the number of cycles. This
stress, as represented by dotted line, is known as endurance or fatigue limit (σe). It is defined as
maximum value of the completely reversed bending stress which a polished standard specimen can
withstand without failure, for infinite number of cycles (usually 107 cycles).
It may be noted that the term endurance limit is used for reversed bending only while for other
types of loading, the term endurance strength may be used when referring the fatigue strength of the
material. It may be defined as the safe maximum stress which can be applied to the machine part
working under actual conditions.
We have seen that when a machine member is subjected to a completely reversed stress, the
maximum stress in tension is equal to the maximum stress in compression as shown in Fig. 6.2 (b). In
actual practice, many machine members undergo different range of stress than the completely
reversed stress.
The stress verses time diagram for fluctuating stress having values σmin and σmax is shown in
Fig. 6.2 (e). The variable stress, in general, may be considered as a combination of steady (or mean or
average) stress and a completely reversed stress component σv. The following relations are derived
from Fig. 6.2 (e):
1. Mean or average stress,
σm =

where

σe = Endurance limit for completely reversed stresses, and
R = Stress ratio.
6.4
Effect of Loading on Endurance Limit—Load Factor
The endurance limit (σe) of a material as determined by the rotating beam method is for
reversed bending load. There are many machine members which are subjected to loads other than
reversed bending loads. Thus the endurance limit will
also be different for different types of loading. The
endurance limit depending upon the type of loading may
be modified as discussed below:
Let
Kb
= Load correction factor for the
reversed or rotating bending  load.
Its value is usually taken as unity.
Ka
= Load correction factor for the
reversed axial load. Its value  may
be taken as 0.8.
Ks
= Load correction factor for the
reversed torsional or shear load. Its
value may be taken as 0.55 for
ductile materials and 0.8 for brittle
materials.
∴ Endurance limit for reversed bending load,
σeb = σe.Kb = σe
...( QKb = 1)
Endurance limit for reversed axial load,
σea = σe.Ka
and endurance limit for reversed torsional or shear load,
τe = σe.Ks
6.5
Effect of Surface Finish on Endurance Limit—Surface Finish Factor
When a machine member is subjected to variable loads, the endurance limit of the material for
that member depends upon the surface conditions. Fig. 6.3 shows the values of surface finish factor
for the various surface conditions and ultimate tensile strength.
Fig. 6.3. Surface finish factor for various surface conditions.
When the surface finish factor is known, then the endurance limit for the material of the machine
member may be obtained by multiplying the endurance limit and the surface finish factor. We see that
Shaft drive.
Contents
Top
Variable Stresses in Machine Parts     185
for a mirror polished material, the surface finish factor is unity. In other words, the endurance limit for
mirror polished material is maximum and it goes on reducing due to surface condition.
Let
 Ksur = Surface finish factor.
∴Endurance limit,
σe1 = σeb.Ksur = σe.Kb.Ksur = σe.Ksur
...( Q Kb = 1)
...(For reversed bending load)
= σea.Ksur = σe.Ka.Ksur
...(For reversed axial load)
= τe.Ksur = σe.Ks.Ksur
...(For reversed torsional or shear load)
Note : The surface finish factor for non-ferrous metals may be taken as unity.
6.6
Effect of Size on Endurance Limit—Size Factor
A little consideration will show that if the size of the standard specimen as shown in Fig. 6.2 (a)
is increased, then the endurance limit of the material will decrease. This is due to the fact that a longer
specimen will have more defects than a smaller one.
Let
 Ksz = Size factor.
∴Endurance limit,
σe2 = σe1 × Ksz
...(Considering surface finish factor also)
= σeb.Ksur.Ksz = σe.Kb.Ksur.Ksz = σe.Ksur.Ksz
( Q Kb = 1)
= σea.Ksur.Ksz = σe.Ka.Ksur.Ksz
...(For reversed axial load)
= τe.Ksur.Ksz = σe.Ks.Ksur.Ksz
... (For reversed torsional or shear load)
Notes: 1. The value of size factor is taken as unity for the standard specimen having nominal diameter of
7.657 mm.
2. When the nominal diameter of the specimen is more than 7.657 mm but less than 50 mm, the value of
size factor may be taken as 0.85.
3. When the nominal diameter of the specimen is more than 50 mm, then the value of size factor may be
taken as 0.75.
6.7
Effect of Miscellaneous Factors on
Endurance Limit
In addition to the surface finish factor (Ksur),
size factor (Ksz) and load factors Kb, Ka and Ks, there
are many other factors such as reliability factor (Kr),
temperature factor (Kt), impact factor (Ki) etc. which
has effect on the endurance limit of a material. Con-
sidering all these factors, the endurance limit may be
determined by using the following expressions :
1. For the reversed bending load, endurance
limit,
σ'e = σeb.Ksur.Ksz.Kr.Kt.Ki
2. For the reversed axial load, endurance limit,
σ'e = σea.Ksur.Ksz.Kr.Kt.Ki
3. For the reversed torsional or shear load,
endurance limit,
σ'e = τe.Ksur.Ksz.Kr.Kt.Ki
In solving problems, if the value of any of the
above factors is not known, it may be taken as unity.
In addition to shear, tensile, compressive and
torsional stresses, temperature can add its own
stress  (Ref. Chapter 4)

6.8
Relation Between Endurance Limit and Ultimate Tensile Strength
It has been found experimentally that endurance limit (σe) of a material subjected to fatigue
loading is a function of ultimate tensile strength (σu). Fig. 6.4 shows the endurance limit of steel
corresponding to ultimate tensile strength for different surface conditions. Following are some
empirical relations commonly used in practice :
Fig. 6.4. Endurance limit of steel corresponding to ultimate tensile strength.
For steel,
σe = 0.5 σu ;
For cast steel,
σe = 0.4 σu ;
For cast iron,
σe = 0.35 σu ;
For non-ferrous metals and alloys,  σe = 0.3 σu
6.9
Factor of Safety for Fatigue Loading
When a component is subjected to fatigue loading, the endurance limit is the criterion for faliure.
Therefore, the factor of safety should be based on endurance limit. Mathematically,
Factor of safety (F.S.) =
Endurance limit stress
Design or working stress
e
d
σ
= σ
Note:    For steel,
σe = 0.8 to 0.9 σy
where
σe = Endurance limit stress for completely reversed stress cycle, and
σy = Yield point stress.
Example 6.1. Determine the design stress for a piston rod where the load is completely
reversed. The surface of the rod is ground and
the surface finish factor is 0.9. There is no stress
concentration. The load is predictable and the
factor of safety is 2.
Solution. Given : Ksur = 0.9 ; F.S. = 2
The piston rod is subjected to reversed
axial loading. We know that for reversed axial
loading, the load correction factor (Ka) is 0.8.

6.10 Stress Concentration
Whenever a machine component changes the shape of its cross-section, the simple stress
distribution no longer holds good and the neighbourhood of the discontinuity is different. This
irregularity in the stress distribution caused by abrupt changes of form is called stress concentration.
It occurs for all kinds of stresses in the presence of fillets, notches, holes, keyways, splines, surface
roughness or scratches etc.
In order to understand fully the idea of stress
concentration, consider a member with different
cross-section under a tensile load as shown in
 Fig. 6.5. A little consideration will show that the
nominal stress in the right and left hand sides will
be uniform but in the region where the cross-
section is changing, a re-distribution of the force
within the member must take place. The material
near the edges is stressed considerably higher than the average value. The maximum stress occurs at
some point on the fillet and is directed parallel to the boundary at that point.
6.11 Theoretical or Form Stress Concentration Factor
The theoretical or form stress concentration factor is defined as the ratio of the maximum stress
in a member (at a notch or a fillet) to the nominal stress at the same section based upon net area.
Mathematically, theoretical or form stress concentration factor,
          Kt = Maximum stress
Nominal stress
The value of Kt depends upon the material and geometry of the part.
Notes: 1. In static loading, stress concentration in ductile materials is not so serious as in brittle materials,
because in ductile materials local deformation or yielding takes place which reduces the concentration. In brittle
materials, cracks may appear at these local concentrations of stress which will increase the stress over the rest of
the section. It is, therefore, necessary that in designing parts of brittle materials such as castings, care should be
taken. In order to avoid failure due to stress concentration, fillets at the changes of section must be provided.
2. In cyclic loading, stress concentration in ductile materials is always serious because the ductility of the
material is not effective in relieving the concentration of stress caused by cracks, flaws, surface roughness, or
any sharp discontinuity in the geometrical form of the member. If the stress at any point in a member is above the
endurance limit of the material, a crack may develop under the action of repeated load and the crack will lead to
failure of the member.
6.12 Stress Concentration due to Holes and Notches
Consider a plate with transverse elliptical hole and subjected to a tensile load as shown in Fig.
6.6 (a). We see from the stress-distribution that the stress at the point away from the hole is practically
uniform and the maximum stress will be induced at the edge of the hole. The maximum stress is given
by
σmax =

When a/b is large, the ellipse approaches a crack transverse to the load and the value of Kt
becomes very large. When a/b is small, the ellipse approaches a longitudinal slit [as shown in Fig. 6.6
(b)] and the increase in stress is small. When the hole is circular as shown in Fig. 6.6 (c), then a/b = 1
and the maximum stress is three times the nominal value.
Fig. 6.6. Stress concentration due to holes.
The stress concentration in the notched tension member, as
shown in Fig. 6.7, is influenced by the depth a of the notch and radius
r at the bottom of the notch. The maximum stress, which applies to
members having notches that are small in comparison with the width
of the plate, may be obtained by the following equation,
σmax =

6.13 Methods of Reducing Stress Concentration
We have already discussed in Art 6.10 that whenever there is a
change in cross-section, such as shoulders, holes, notches or keyways and where there is an interfer-
ence fit between a hub or bearing race and a shaft, then stress concentration results. The presence of
stress concentration can not be totally eliminated but it may be reduced to some extent. A device or
concept that is useful in assisting a design engineer to visualize the presence of stress concentration

and how it may be mitigated is that of stress flow lines, as shown in Fig. 6.8. The mitigation of stress
concentration means that the stress flow lines shall maintain their spacing as far as possible.
Fig. 6.8
In Fig. 6.8 (a) we see that stress lines tend to bunch up and cut very close to the sharp re-entrant
corner. In order to improve the situation, fillets may be provided, as shown in Fig. 6.8 (b) and (c) to
give more equally spaced flow lines.
Figs. 6.9 to 6.11 show the several ways of reducing the stress concentration in shafts and other
cylindrical members with shoulders, holes and threads respectively. It may be noted that it is not
practicable to use large radius fillets as in case of ball and roller bearing mountings. In such cases,
notches may be cut as shown in Fig. 6.8 (d) and Fig. 6.9 (b) and (c).

The stress concentration effects of a press fit may be reduced by making more gradual transition
from the rigid to the more flexible shaft. The various ways of reducing stress concentration for such
cases are shown in Fig. 6.12 (a), (b) and (c).

6.14 Factors to be Considered while Designing Machine Parts to Avoid
Fatigue Failure
The following factors should be considered while designing machine parts to avoid fatigue failure:
1.
The variation in the size of the component should be as gradual as possible.
2.
The holes, notches and other stress raisers should be avoided.
3.
The proper stress de-concentrators such as fillets and notches should be provided
wherever necessary.
Fig. 6.12. Methods of reducing stress concentration of a press fit.
4.
The parts should be protected from corrosive atmosphere.
5.
A smooth finish of outer surface of the component increases the fatigue life.
6.
The material with high fatigue strength should be selected.
7.
The residual compressive stresses over the parts surface increases its fatigue strength.

Stepped shaft
Example 6.2. Find the maximum
stress induced in the following cases
taking stress concentration into
account:
1. A rectangular plate 60 mm ×
10 mm with a hole 12 diameter as
shown in Fig. 6.13 (a) and subjected
to a tensile load of 12 kN.
2. A stepped shaft as shown in
Fig. 6.13 (b) and carrying a tensile
load of 12 kN.
Fig. 6.13
Solution. Case 1. Given : b = 60 mm ; t = 10 mm ; d = 12 mm ; W = 12 kN = 12 × 103 N
We know that cross-sectional area of the plate,
A = (b – d) t = (60 – 12) 10 = 480 mm2
∴
Nominal stress =

Case 2. Given : D = 50 mm ; d = 25 mm ; r = 5 mm ; W = 12 kN = 12 × 103 N

∴
Maximum stress = Kt × Nominal stress = 1.64 × 24.4 = 40 MPa Ans.

6.16 Fatigue Stress Concentration Factor
When a machine member is subjected to cyclic or fatigue loading, the value of fatigue stress
concentration factor shall be applied instead of theoretical stress concentration factor. Since the
determination of fatigue stress concentration factor is not an easy task, therefore from experimental
tests it is defined as
Fatigue stress concentration factor,
Kf = Endurance limit without stress concentration
Endurance limit with stress concentration
6.17 Notch Sensitivity
In cyclic loading, the effect of the notch or the fillet is usually less than predicted by the use of
the theoretical factors as discussed before. The difference depends upon the stress gradient in the
region of the stress concentration and on the hardness of the material. The term notch sensitivity is
applied to this behaviour. It may be defined as the degree to which the theoretical effect of stress
concentration is actually reached. The stress gradient depends mainly on the radius of the notch, hole
or fillet and on the grain size of the material. Since the extensive data for estimating the notch sensitivity
factor (q) is not available, therefore the curves, as shown in Fig. 6.14, may be used for determining
the values of q for two steels.
Fig. 6.14. Notch sensitivity.
When the notch sensitivity factor q is used in cyclic loading, then fatigue stress concentration
factor may be obtained from the following relations:
q =
– 1
–1
f
t
K

or
Kf = 1 + q (Kt – 1)

and
Kfs = 1 + q (Kts – 1)

where
Kt = Theoretical stress concentration factor for axial or bending
loading, and
Kts = Theoretical stress concentration factor for torsional or shear
loading.
6.18 Combined Steady and
Variable Stress
The failure points from fatigue
tests made with different steels and
combinations of mean and variable
stresses are plotted in Fig. 6.15 as
functions of variable stress (σv) and
mean stress (σm). The most significant
observation is that, in general, the
failure point is little related to the mean
stress when it is compressive but is very
much a function of the mean stress when
it is tensile. In practice, this means that
fatigue failures are rare when the mean
stress is compressive (or negative).
Therefore, the greater emphasis must be
given to the combination of a variable
stress and a steady (or mean) tensile
stress.
Fig. 6.15. Combined mean and variable stress.
There are several ways in which problems involving this combination of stresses may be solved,
but the following are important from the subject point of view :
1. Gerber method, 2. Goodman method, and 3. Soderberg method.
We shall now discuss these methods, in detail, in the following pages.
Protective colour coatings are added to make components
it corrosion resistant. Corrosion if not taken care can magnify
other stresses.

6.19 Gerber Method for
Combination of Stresses
The relationship between variable
stress (σv) and mean stress (σm) for axial and
bending loading for ductile materials are
shown in Fig. 6.15. The point σe represents
the fatigue strength corresponding to the case
of complete reversal (σm = 0) and the point
σu represents the static ultimate strength
corresponding to σv = 0.
A parabolic curve drawn between the
endurance limit (σe) and ultimate tensile
strength (σu) was proposed by Gerber in
1874. Generally, the test data for ductile
material fall closer to Gerber parabola as
shown in Fig. 6.15, but because of scatter in
the test points, a straight line relationship (i.e.
Goodman line and Soderberg line) is usually
preferred in designing machine parts.
According to Gerber, variable stress,
σv = σe

6.20 Goodman Method for
Combination of Stresses
A straight line connecting the endurance
limit (σe) and the ultimate strength (σu), as
shown by line AB in Fig. 6.16, follows the
suggestion of Goodman. A Goodman line is
used when the design is based on ultimate
strength and may be used for ductile or brittle
materials.
In Fig. 6.16, line AB connecting σe and
Liquid refrigerant absorbs heat as it vaporizes inside the
evaporator coil of a refrigerator. The heat is released
when a compressor turns the refrigerant back to liquid.

Here we have assumed the same factor of safety (F.S.) for the ultimate tensile strength (σu) and endurance

This expression does not include the effect of stress concentration. It may be noted that for
ductile materials, the stress concentration may be ignored under steady loads.
Since many machine and structural parts that are subjected to fatigue loads contain regions of
high stress concentration, therefore equation (i) must be altered to include this effect. In such cases,
the fatigue stress concentration factor (Kf) is used to multiply the variable stress (σv). The equation (i)

Notes : 1. The equation (iii) is applicable to ductile materials subjected to reversed bending loads (tensile or
compressive). For brittle materials, the theoretical stress concentration factor (Kt) should be applied to the mean
stress and fatigue stress concentration factor (Kf) to the variable stress. Thus for brittle materials, the equation

Variable Stresses in Machine Parts     201
Example 6.3.  A machine component is
subjected to a flexural stress which fluctuates
between + 300 MN/m2 and – 150 MN/m2.
Determine the value of minimum ultimate strength
according to 1. Gerber relation; 2. Modified
Goodman relation; and 3. Soderberg relation.
Take yield strength = 0.55 Ultimate strength;
Endurance strength = 0.5 Ultimate strength; and
factor of safety = 2.
Solution. Given : σ1 = 300 MN/m2 ;
σ2 = – 150 MN/m2 ; σy = 0.55 σu ; σe = 0.5 σu ;

Example 6.4. A bar of circular cross-section is subjected to alternating tensile forces varying
from a minimum of 200 kN to a maximum of 500 kN. It is to be manufactured of a material with an
ultimate tensile strength of 900 MPa and an endurance limit of 700 MPa. Determine the diameter of
bar using safety factors of 3.5 related to ultimate tensile strength and 4 related to endurance limit
and a stress concentration factor of 1.65 for fatigue load. Use Goodman straight line as basis for
design.
Solution. Given : Wmin = 200 kN ; Wmax = 500 kN ; σu = 900 MPa = 900 N/mm2 ; σe = 700 MPa
= 700 N/mm2 ; (F.S.)u = 3.5 ; (F.S.)e = 4 ; Kf = 1.65

Paint Manufacture : A typical gloss paint is made by first mixing
natural oils and resins called alkyds. Thinner is added to make
the mixture easier to pump through a filter that removes any
solid particles from the blended liquids. Pigment is mixed into
the binder blend in a powerful mixer called a disperser.

Example 6.5. Determine the thickness of a 120 mm wide uniform plate for safe continuous
operation if the plate is to be subjected to a tensile load that has a maximum value of 250 kN and a
minimum value of 100 kN. The properties of the plate material are as follows:
Endurance limit stress = 225 MPa, and Yield point stress = 300 MPa.

Example 6.7. A steel rod is subjected to a reversed axial load of 180 kN. Find the diameter of
the rod for a factor of safety of 2. Neglect column action. The material has an ultimate tensile
strength of 1070 MPa and yield strength of 910 MPa. The endurance limit in reversed bending
may be assumed to be one-half of the ultimate tensile strength. Other correction factors may be
taken as follows:
For axial loading = 0.7; For machined surface = 0.8 ; For size = 0.85 ; For stress
concentration = 1.0.
Solution. Given : Wmax = 180 kN ; Wmin = – 180 kN ; F.S. = 2 ; σu = 1070 MPa = 1070

Example 6.8. A circular bar of 500 mm length is supported freely at its two ends. It is acted
upon by a central concentrated cyclic load having a minimum value of 20 kN and a maximum value
of 50 kN. Determine the diameter of bar by taking a factor of safety of 1.5, size effect of 0.85, surface
finish factor of 0.9. The material properties of bar are given by : ultimate strength of 650 MPa, yield
strength of 500 MPa and endurance strength of 350 MPa.
Solution. Given : l = 500 mm ; Wmin = 20 kN = 20 × 103 N ; Wmax = 50 kN = 50 × 103 N ;
F.S. = 1.5 ; Ksz = 0.85 ; Ksur = 0.9 ; σu = 650 MPa = 650 N/mm2 ; σy = 500 MPa = 500 N/mm2 ;

strength (i.e. σe = 0.5 σu) and the endurance limit in shear (τe) is taken as 0.55 σe, therefore
τe = 0.55 σe = 0.55 × 0.5 σu = 0.275 σu
= 0.275 × 630 = 173.25 N/mm2
Assume the yield stress (σy) for carbon steel in reversed bending as 510 N/mm2, surface finish
factor (Ksur) as 0.87, size factor (Ksz) as 0.85 and fatigue stress concentration factor (Kfs) as 1.

Example 6.10. A cantilever beam made of cold drawn carbon steel of circular cross-section as
shown in Fig. 6.18, is subjected to a load which varies
from – F to 3 F. Determine the maximum load that this
member can withstand for an indefinite life using a factor
of safety as 2. The theoretical stress concentration factor
is 1.42 and the notch sensitivity is 0.9. Assume the
following values :
Ultimate stress

Solution. Given : Wmin = – F ; Wmax = 3 F ; F.S. = 2 ; Kt = 1.42 ; q = 0.9 ; σu = 550 MPa
= 550 N/mm2 ; σy = 470 MPa = 470 N/mm2 ; σe = 275 MPa = 275 N/mm2 ; Ksz = 0.85 ; Ksur = 0.89

The beam as shown in Fig. 6.18 is subjected to a reversed bending load only. Since the point A
at the change of cross section is critical, therefore we shall find the bending moment at point A.
We know that maximum bending moment at point A,
Mmax = Wmax × 125 = 3F × 125 = 375 F N-mm
and minimum bending moment at point A,
Mmin = Wmin × 125 = – F × 125 = – 125 F N-mm

Example 6.11. A simply supported beam has a concentrated load at the centre which fluctuates
from a value of P to 4 P. The span of the beam is 500 mm and its cross-section is circular with a
diameter of 60 mm. Taking for the beam material an ultimate stress of 700 MPa, a yield stress of 500
MPa, endurance limit of 330 MPa for reversed bending, and a factor of safety of 1.3, calculate the
maximum value of P. Take a size factor of 0.85 and a surface finish factor of 0.9.
Solution. Given : Wmin = P ; Wmax = 4P ; L = 500 mm; d = 60 mm ; σu = 700 MPa = 700 N/mm2 ;
σy = 500 MPa = 500 N/mm2 ; σe = 330 MPa = 330 N/mm2 ; F.S. = 1.3 ; Ksz = 0.85 ; Ksur = 0.9

6.22 Combined Variable Normal Stress and Variable Shear Stress
When a machine part is subjected to both variable normal stress and a variable shear stress; then
it is designed by using the following two theories of combined stresses :
1. Maximum shear stress theory, and 2. Maximum normal stress theory.

Example 6.12. A steel cantilever is 200 mm long. It is subjected to an axial load which varies
from 150 N (compression) to 450 N (tension) and also a transverse load at its free end which varies
from 80 N up to 120 N down. The cantilever is of circular cross-section. It is of diameter 2d for the
first 50 mm and of diameter d for the remaining length. Determine its diameter taking a factor of
safety of 2. Assume the following values :
Yield stress
=  330 MPa
Endurance limit in reversed loading
=  300 MPa

Solution. Given : l = 200 mm; Wa(max) = 450 N; Wa(min) = – 150 N ; Wt(max) = 120 N ;
Wt(min) = – 80 N; F.S. =2 ; σy = 330 MPa = 330 N/mm2 ; σe = 300 MPa = 300 N/mm2 ;

First of all, let us find the equiva-
lent normal stress for point A which is
critical as shown in Fig. 6.19. It is assumed
that the equivalent normal stress at this
point will be the algebraic sum of the
equivalent normal stress due to axial load-
ing and equivalent normal stress due to
bending (i.e. due to transverse load act-
ing at the free end).

Example 6.13. A hot rolled steel shaft is subjected to a torsional moment that varies from
330 N-m clockwise to 110 N-m counterclockwise and an applied bending moment at a critical section
varies from 440 N-m to – 220 N-m. The shaft is of uniform cross-section and no keyway is present at
the critical section. Determine the required shaft diameter. The material has an ultimate strength of
550 MN/m2 and a yield strength of 410 MN/m2. Take the endurance limit as half the ultimate strength,
factor of safety of 2, size factor of 0.85 and a surface finish factor of 0.62.

Example 6.14. A pulley is keyed to a shaft midway between two bearings. The shaft is made of
cold drawn steel for which the ultimate strength is 550 MPa and the yield strength is 400 MPa. The
bending moment at the pulley varies from – 150 N-m to + 400 N-m as the torque on the shaft varies
from – 50 N-m to + 150 N-m. Obtain the diameter of the shaft for an indefinite life. The stress
concentration factors for the keyway at the pulley in bending and in torsion are 1.6 and 1.3 respectively.
Take the following values:
Factor of safety
=  1.5
Load correction factors
=  1.0 in bending, and 0.6 in torsion
Size effect factor
=  0.85
Surface effect factor
=  0.88
Machine parts are often made
of alloys to improve their

Variable Stresses in Machine Parts     215
Solution. Given : σu = 550 MPa = 550 N/mm2 ; σy = 400 MPa = 400 N/mm2 ;
Mmin = – 150 N-m; Mmax = 400 N-m ; Tmin = – 50 N-m ; Tmax = 150 N-m ; Kfb = 1.6 ; Kfs = 1.3 ;

Let

The majority of rotating shafts carry a steady torque and the loads remain fixed in space in both
direction and magnitude. Thus during each revolution every fibre on the surface of the shaft under-
goes a complete reversal of stress due to bending moment. Therefore for the usual case when Mm = 0,
Mv = M, Tm = T and Tv = 0, the above equation may be written as

Variable Stresses in Machine Parts     219
Example 6.15. A centrifugal blower rotates at 600 r.p.m. A belt drive is used to connect the
blower to a 15 kW and 1750 r.p.m. electric motor. The belt forces a torque of 250 N-m and a force of
2500 N on the shaft. Fig. 6.20 shows the location of bearings, the steps in the shaft and the plane in
which the resultant belt force and torque act. The ratio of the journal diameter to the overhung shaft
diameter is 1.2 and the radius of the fillet is 1/10th of overhung shaft diameter. Find the shaft diameter,
journal diameter and radius of fillet to have a factor of safety 3. The blower shaft is to be machined
from hot rolled steel having the following values of stresses:
Endurance limit = 180 MPa; Yield point stress = 300 MPa; Ultimate tensile stress = 450 MPa.
Solution. Given: *NB = 600 r.p.m. ; *P = 15 kW; *NM = 1750 r.p.m. ; T = 250 N-m = 250 × 103
N-mm; F = 2500 N ; F.S. = 3; σe = 180 MPa = 180 N/mm2 ; σy = 300 MPa = 300 N/mm2 ; σu = 450
MPa = 450 N/mm2
Fig. 6.20
Let
D = Journal diameter,
d = Shaft diameter, and r = Fillet radius.
∴Ratio of journal diameter to shaft diameter,
D/d = 1.2
...(Given)
and radius of the fillet,
r = 1/10 × Shaft diameter (d) = 0.1 d
∴
r/d = 0.1
...(Given)
From Table 6.3, for D/d = 1.2 and r/d = 0.1, the theoretical stress concentration factor,
Kt = 1.62
The two points at which failure may occur are at the end of the keyway and at the shoulder fillet.
The critical section will be the one with larger product of Kf × M. Since the notch sensitivity factor q
is dependent upon the unknown dimensions of the notch and since the curves for notch sensitivity
factor (Fig. 6.14) are not applicable to keyways, therefore the product Kt × M shall be the basis of
comparison for the two sections.
∴  Bending moment at the end of the keyway,
Kt × M = 1.6 × 2500 [100 – (25 + 10)]  = 260 × 103 N-mm
...(Q Kt for key ways = 1.6)
and bending moment at the shoulder fillet,
Kt × M = 1.62 × 2500 (100 – 25) = 303 750 N-mm
Since Kt × M at the shoulder fillet is large, therefore considering the shoulder fillet as the critical
section. We know that

Note: Since r is known (because r/d = 0.1 or r = 0.1d = 4 mm), therefore from Fig. 6.14, the notch sensitivity
factor (q) may be obtained. For r = 4 mm, we have q = 0.93.
∴Fatigue stress concentration factor,
Kf = 1 + q (Kt – 1) = 1 + 0.93 (1.62 – 1) = 1.58
Using this value of Kf instead of Kt, a new value of d may be calculated. We see that magnitudes of Kf and
Kt are very close, therefore recalculation will not give any improvement in the results already obtained.

7.1
Introduction
The pressure vessels (i.e. cylinders or tanks) are used
to store fluids under pressure. The fluid being stored may
undergo a change of state inside the pressure vessel as in
case of steam boilers or it may combine with other reagents
as in a chemical plant. The pressure vessels are designed
with great care because rupture of a pressure vessel means
an explosion which may cause loss of life and property.
The material of pressure vessels may be brittle such as cast
iron, or ductile such as mild steel.
7.2
Classification of Pressure Vessels
The pressure vessels may be classified as follows:
1. According to the dimensions. The pressure
vessels, according to their dimensions, may be classified
as thin shell or thick shell. If the wall thickness of the shell
(t) is less than 1/10 of the diameter of the shell (d), then it is
called a thin shell. On the other hand, if the wall thickness

of the shell is greater than 1/10 of the
diameter of the shell, then it is said to
be a thick shell. Thin shells are used
in boilers, tanks and pipes, whereas
thick shells are used in high pressure
cylinders, tanks, gun barrels etc.
Note: Another criterion to classify the
pressure vessels as thin shell or thick shell
is the internal fluid pressure (p) and the
allowable stress (σt). If the internal fluid
pressure (p) is less than 1/6 of the allowable
stress, then it is called a thin shell. On the
other hand, if the internal fluid pressure is
greater than 1/6 of the allowable stress, then
it is said to be a thick shell.
2. According to the end
construction. The pressure vessels,
according to the end construction, may be classified as open end or closed end. A simple cylinder
with a piston, such as cylinder of a press is an example of an open end vessel, whereas a tank is an
example of a closed end vessel. In case of vessels having open ends, the circumferential or hoop
stresses are induced by the fluid pressure, whereas in case of closed ends, longitudinal stresses in
addition to circumferential stresses are induced.
7.3
Stresses in a Thin Cylindrical Shell due to an Internal Pressure
The analysis of stresses induced in a thin cylindrical shell are made on the following
assumptions:
1.
The effect of curvature of the cylinder wall is neglected.
2.
The tensile stresses are uniformly distributed over the section of the walls.
3.
The effect of the restraining action of the heads at the end of the pressure vessel is neglected.
Fig. 7.1. Failure of a cylindrical shell.
When a thin cylindrical shell is subjected to an internal pressure, it is likely to fail in the following
two ways:
1.
It may fail along the longitudinal section (i.e. circumferentially) splitting the cylinder into
two troughs, as shown in Fig. 7.1 (a).
2.
It may fail across the transverse section (i.e. longitudinally) splitting the cylinder into two
cylindrical shells, as shown in Fig. 7.1 (b).

A section cut from a cylinder by a plane that contains the axis is called longitudinal section.
Thus the wall of a cylindrical shell subjected to an internal pressure has to withstand tensile
stresses of the following two types:
(a) Circumferential or hoop stress, and (b) Longitudinal stress.
These stresses are discussed, in detail, in the following articles.
7.4
Circumferential or Hoop Stress
Consider a thin cylindrical shell subjected to an internal pressure as shown in Fig. 7.2 (a) and
(b). A tensile stress acting in a direction tangential to the circumference is called circumferential or
hoop stress. In other words, it is a tensile stress on *longitudinal section (or on the cylindrical walls).
Fig. 7.2. Circumferential or hoop stress.
Let
p = Intensity of internal pressure,
d = Internal diameter of the cylindrical shell,
l = Length of the cylindrical shell,
t = Thickness of the cylindrical shell, and
σt1 = Circumferential or hoop stress for the material of the
cylindrical shell.
We know that the total force acting on a longitudinal section (i.e. along the diameter X-X) of the
shell
= Intensity of pressure × Projected area = p × d × l
...(i)
and the total resisting force acting on the cylinder walls
= σt1 × 2t × l
...(Q of two sections)
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we have

A section cut from a cylinder by a plane at right angles to the axis of the cylinder is called transverse
section.
3.
In case of cylinders of ductile material, the value of circumferential stress (σt1) may be taken
0.8 times the yield point stress (σy) and for brittle materials, σt1 may be taken as 0.125 times
the ultimate tensile stress (σu).
4.
In designing steam boilers, the wall thickness calculated by the above equation may be
compared with the minimum plate thickness as provided in boiler code as given in the
following table.
Table 7.1. Minimum plate thickness for steam boilers.

Above 0.9 m and upto 1.35 m

Over 1.8 m

Note: If the calculated value of t is less than the code requirement, then the latter should be taken, otherwise the
calculated value may be used.
The boiler code also provides that the factor of safety shall be at least 5 and the steel of the
plates and rivets shall have as a minimum the following ultimate stresses.
Tensile stress,
σt = 385 MPa
Compressive stress,
σc = 665 MPa
Shear stress,
τ = 308 MPa
7.5
Longitudinal Stress
Consider a closed thin cylindrical shell subjected to an internal pressure as shown in Fig. 7.3 (a)
and (b). A tensile stress acting in the direction of the axis is called longitudinal stress. In other words,
it is a tensile stress acting on the *transverse or circumferential section Y-Y (or on the ends of the
vessel).

From above we see that the longitudinal stress is half of the circumferential or hoop stress.
Therefore, the design of a pressure vessel must be based on the maximum stress i.e. hoop stress.

pressure of 1.75 N/mm2. Find the minimum wall thickness, if (a) the longitudinal stress does not

Solution. Given : d = 1.2 m = 1200 mm ; p = 1.75 N/mm2 ; σt2 = 28 MPa = 28 N/mm2 ;

spherical pressure tank ‘A’ connected to a working cylinder B. The pump maintains a pressure of
3 N/mm2 in the tank.
1. If the diameter of pressure tank is 800 mm, determine its thickness for 100% efficiency of
the joint. Assume the allowable tensile stress as 50 MPa.

2. Determine the diameter of a cast iron cylinder and its thickness to produce an operating
force F = 25 kN. Assume (i) an allowance of 10 per cent of operating force F for friction in the

Change in Dimensions of a Thin Cylindrical Shell due to an Internal
Pressure
When a thin cylindrical shell is subjected to an internal pressure, there will be an increase in the
diameter as well as the length of the shell.
Let
l = Length of the cylindrical shell,
d = Diameter of the cylindrical shell,
t = Thickness of the cylindrical shell,
p = Intensity of internal pressure,
E = Young’s modulus for the material of the cylindrical shell, and
μ = Poisson’s ratio.

Thin Spherical Shells Subjected to an Internal Pressure
Consider a thin spherical shell subjected to an internal pressure as shown in Fig. 7.5.
Let
V = Storage capacity of the shell,
p = Intensity of internal pressure,
d = Diameter of the shell,
t = Thickness of the shell,
σt = Permissible tensile stress for the
shell material.
In designing thin spherical shells, we have to determine
1. Diameter of the shell, and 2. Thickness of the shell.
1.  Diameter of the shell
We know that the storage capacity of the shell,

2.  Thickness of the shell
As a result of the internal pressure, the shell is likely to rupture along the centre of the sphere.
Therefore force tending to rupture the shell along the centre of the sphere or bursting force,

...(i)
and resisting force of the shell
= Stress × Resisting area = σt × π d.t
...(ii)
Equating equations (i) and (ii), we have

Thick Cylindrical Shells Subjected to an Internal Pressure
When a cylindrical shell of a pressure vessel, hydraulic cylinder, gunbarrel and a pipe is subjected
to a very high internal fluid pressure, then the walls of the cylinder must be made extremely heavy or
thick.
In thin cylindrical shells, we have assumed that the tensile stresses are uniformly distributed
over the section of the walls. But in the case of thick wall cylinders as shown in Fig. 7.6 (a), the stress
over the section of the walls cannot be assumed to be uniformly distributed. They develop both
tangential and radial stresses with values which are dependent upon the radius of the element under
consideration. The distribution of stress in a thick cylindrical shell is shown in Fig. 7.6 (b) and (c). We
see that the tangential stress is maximum at the inner surface and minimum at the outer surface of the
shell. The radial stress is maximum at the inner surface and zero at the outer surface of the shell.

In the design of thick cylindrical shells, the following equations are mostly used:
1. Lame’s equation; 2. Birnie’s equation; 3. Clavarino’s equation; and 4. Barlow’s equation.
The use of these equations depends upon the type of material used and the end construction.

Let
ro = Outer radius of cylindrical shell,
ri = Inner radius of cylindrical shell,
t = Thickness of cylindrical shell = ro – ri,
p = Intensity of internal pressure,
μ = Poisson’s ratio,
σt = Tangential stress, and
σr = Radial stress.
All the above mentioned equations are now discussed, in detail, as below:
1. Lame’s equation. Assuming that the longitudinal fibres of the cylindrical shell are equally
strained, Lame has shown that the tangential stress at any radius x is,

We see that the tangential stress is always a tensile stress whereas the radial stress is a compressive
stress. We know that the tangential stress is maximum at the inner surface of the shell (i.e. when
x = r i) and it is minimum at the outer surface of the shell (i.e. when x = ro). Substituting the value of
x = ri and x = ro in equation (i), we find that the *maximum tangential stress at the inner surface of the

We also know that the radial stress is maximum at the inner surface of the shell and zero at the

The value of σt for brittle materials may be taken as 0.125 times the ultimate tensile
strength (σu).
We have discussed above the design of a thick cylindrical shell of brittle materials. In case of
cylinders made of ductile material, Lame’s equation is modified according to maximum shear stress
theory.
According to this theory, the maximum shear stress at any point in a strained body is equal to
one-half the algebraic difference of the maximum and minimum principal stresses at that point. We
know that for a thick cylindrical shell,

From the above expression, we see that if the internal pressure ( p) is equal to or greater than
the allowable working stress (σt or τ), then no thickness of the cylinder wall will prevent failure.
Thus, it is impossible to design a cylinder to withstand fluid pressure greater than the allowable
working stress for a given material. This difficulty is overcome by using compound cylinders (See
Art. 7.10).

2. Birnie’s equation. In
case of open-end cylinders (such
as pump cylinders, rams, gun
barrels etc.) made of ductile
material (i.e. low carbon steel,
brass, bronze, and aluminium
alloys), the allowable stresses
cannot be determined by means of
maximum-stress theory of failure.
In such cases, the maximum-strain
theory is used. According to this
theory, the failure occurs when the
strain reaches a limiting value and

4. Barlow’s equation. This equation is generally used for high pressure oil and gas pipes.
According to this equation, the thickness of a cylinder,
t = p.ro / σt
For ductile materials, σt = 0.8 σy and for brittle materials σt = 0.125 σu, where σu is the ultimate
stress.
Example 7.7. A cast iron cylinder of internal diameter 200 mm and thickness 50 mm is
subjected to a pressure of 5 N/mm2. Calculate the tangential and radial stresses at the inner, middle
(radius = 125 mm) and outer surfaces.
Solution. Given : di = 200 mm or ri = 100 mm ; t = 50 mm ; p = 5 N/mm2
We know that outer radius of the cylinder,
ro = ri + t = 100 + 50 = 150 mm
Oil is frequently transported by ships called tankers. The larger tank-
ers, such as this Acrco Alaska oil transporter, are known as super-
tankers. They can be hundreds of metres long.

Calculate the wall thickness if the cylinder is made of

brittle material.
Solution. Given : W = 1000 kN = 1000 × 103 N ;
d = 250 mm ; σt = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2
First of all, let us find the pressure inside the
cylinder (p). We know that load on the hydraulic press
(W),
1000 × 103 = 4
π  × d 2 × p = 4
π  (250)2 p = 49.1 × 103p

We have discussed in Art. 7.9 [equation (iv)], that the shear stress (τ) is usually taken one-half
the tensile stress (σt). In the present case, τ = σt / 2 = 18/2 = 9 N/mm2. Since τ is less than the internal
pressure ( p = 10 N/mm2), therefore the expression under the square root will be negative. Thus no
thickness can prevent failure of the cylinder. Hence it is impossible to design a cylinder to withstand
fluid pressure greater than the allowable working stress for the given material. This difficulty is
overcome by using compound cylinders as discussed in Art. 7.10.
Thus, we shall use a cylinder of wall thickness, t = 87 mm Ans.
Example 7.10. The cylinder of a portable hydraulic riveter is 220 mm in diameter. The pressure
of the fluid is 14 N/mm2 by gauge. Determine suitable thickness of the cylinder wall assuming that
the maximum permissible tensile stress is not to exceed 105 MPa.
Solution. Given : di = 220 mm or ri = 110 mm ; p = 14 N/mm2 ; σt = 105 MPa = 105 N/mm2
Since the pressure of the fluid is high, therefore thick cylinder equation is used.
Assuming the material of the cylinder as steel, the thickness of the cylinder wall (t) may be
obtained by using Birnie’s equation. We know that

= 200 (1.06 – 1) = 12 mm Ans.
∴ Outer diameter of the cylinder,
do = di + 2t = 400 + 2 × 12 = 424 mm Ans.
2.  Design of piston rod
Let
dp = Diameter of the piston rod.
We know that the force acting on the piston rod,
F = 4
π  (di)2 p = 4
π  (400)2 5 = 628 400 N
...(i)
We also know that the force acting on the piston rod,
F = 4
π  (di)2 σtp = 4
π  (dp)2 60 = 47.13 (dp)2 N
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we have
(dp)2 = 628 400/47.13 = 13 333.33   or   dp = 115.5 say 116 mm Ans.
3. Design of the hinge pin
Let
dh = Diameter of the hinge pin of the piston rod.
Since the load on the pin is equal to the force acting on the piston rod, and the hinge pin is in
double shear, therefore
F = 2 × 4
π  (dh)2 τ
628 400 = 2 × 4
π  (dh)2 45 = 70.7 (dh)2
...(Taking τ = 45 N/mm2)
∴
(dh)2 = 628 400 / 70.7 = 8888.3   or   dh = 94.3 say 95 mm Ans.
When the cover is hinged to the cylinder, we can use two hinge pins only diametrically opposite
to each other. Thus the diameter of the hinge pins for cover,
dhc =

4. Design of the flat end cover
Let
tc = Thickness of the end cover.
We know that force on the end cover,
F = di × tc × σt
628 400 = 400 × tc × 80 = 32 × 103 tc
∴
tc = 628 400 / 32 × 103 = 19.64 say 20 mm Ans.
The hydraulic cylinder with piston, piston rod, end cover and O-ring is shown in Fig. 7.7.
7.10 Compound Cylindrical Shells
According to Lame’s equation, the thickness of a cylindrical shell is given by
t =

–
t
i
t
p
r
p
⎛
⎞
σ +
⎜

σ
⎝
⎠
From this equation, we see that if the internal pressure
(p) acting on the shell is equal to or greater than the allowable
working stress (σt) for the material of the shell, then no thickness
of the shell will prevent failure. Thus it is impossible to design
a cylinder to withstand internal pressure equal to or greater
than the allowable working stress.
This difficulty is overcome by inducing an initial
compressive stress on the wall of the cylindrical shell. This
may be done by the following two methods:
1. By using compound cylindrical shells, and
2. By using the theory of plasticity.
In a compound cylindrical shell, as shown in Fig. 7.8,
the outer cylinder (having inside diameter smaller than the
outside diameter of the inner cylinder) is shrunk fit over the inner cylinder by heating and cooling. On
cooling, the contact pressure is developed at the junction of the two cylinders, which induces
compressive tangential stress in the material of the inner cylinder and tensile tangential stress in the
material of the outer cylinder. When the cylinder is loaded, the compressive stresses are first relieved
and then tensile stresses are induced. Thus, a compound cylinder is effective in resisting higher
internal pressure than a single cylinder with the same overall dimensions. The principle of compound
cylinder is used in the design of gun tubes.
In the theory of plasticity, a temporary high internal pressure is applied till the plastic stage is
reached near the inside of the cylinder wall. This results in a residual compressive stress upon the
removal of the internal pressure, thereby making the cylinder more effective to withstand a higher
internal pressure.
7.11 Stresses in Compound Cylindrical Shells
Fig. 7.9 (a) shows a compound cylindrical shell assembled with a shrink fit. We have discussed
in the previous article that when the outer cylinder is shrunk fit over the inner cylinder, a contact
pressure (p) is developed at junction of the two cylinders (i.e. at radius r2 ) as shown in Fig. 7.9 (b)
and (c). The stresses resulting from this pressure may be easily determined by using Lame’s equation.
According to this equation (See Art. 7.9), the tangential stress at any radius x is
σt =

The equations (vii) to (x) cannot be solved until the contact pressure ( p) is known. In obtaining
a shrink fit, the outside
diameter of the inner cylinder
is made larger than the inside
diameter of the outer cylinder.
This difference in diameters is
called the interference and is
the deformation which the two
cylinders must experience.
Since the diameters of the
cylinders are usually known,
therefore the deformation
should be calculated to find
the contact pressure.
Let
δo = Increase in inner radius of the outer cylinder,
δi = Decrease in outer radius of the inner cylinder,
Eo = Young’s modulus for the material of the outer cylinder,
Ei = Young’s modulus for the material of the inner cylinder, and
μ = Poisson’s ratio.

Example 7.12. The hydraulic press, having a working pressure of water as 16 N/mm2 and
exerting a force of 80 kN is required to press materials upto a maximum size of 800 mm × 800 mm
and 800 mm high, the stroke length is 80 mm. Design and draw the following parts of the press :
1. Design of ram; 2. Cylinder; 3. Pillars; and 4. Gland.
Solution. Given: p = 16 N/mm2 ; F = 80 kN = 80 × 103 N
The hydraulic press is shown in Fig. 7.10.
1. Design of ram
Let
dr = Diameter of ram.
We know that the maximum force to be exerted by the ram (F),
80 × 103 = 4
π  (dr)2 p = 4
π  (dr)2 16 = 12.57 (dr)2
∴

In case the ram is made hollow in order to reduce its weight, then it can be designed as a thick
cylinder subjected to external pressure. We have already discussed in Art. 7.11 that according to
Lame’s equation, maximum tangential stress (considering external pressure only) is

2. Design of cylinder
Let
dci = Inner diameter of cylinder, and
dco = Outer diameter of cylinder.
Assuming a clearance of 15 mm between the ram and the cylinder bore, therefore inner
diameter of the cylinder,
dci = dro + Clearance = 80 + 15 = 95 mm Ans.
The cylinder is usually made of cast iron for which the tensile stress may be taken as 30 N/mm2.

3. Design of pillars
Let
dp = Diameter of the pillar.
The function of the pillars is to support the top plate and to guide the sliding plate. When the
material is being pressed, the pillars will be under direct tension. Let there are four pillars and the load
is equally shared by these pillars.
∴  Load on each pillar
= 80 × 103/4 = 20 × 103 N
...(i)
We know that load on each pillar
= 4
π  (dp)2 σt = 4
π  (dp)2 75 = 58.9 (dp)2
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii),
(dp)2 = 20 × 103/58.9 = 340
or
dp = 18.4 mm
From fine series of metric threads, let us adopt the threads on pillars as M 20 × 1.5 having major
diameter as 20 mm and core diameter as 18.16 mm. Ans.
4. Design of gland
The gland is shown in Fig 7.11. The width (w) of the
U-leather packing for a ram is given empirically as 2 
r
d
to 2.5 
r
d , where dr is the diameter (outer) of the ram in mm.
Let us take width of the packing as 2.2 
r
d .
∴Width of packing,
                             w  = 2.2 
80  = 19.7 say 20 mm Ans.
and outer diameter of gland,
DG = dr + 2 w = 80 + 2 × 20 = 120 mm Ans.
We know that total upward load on the gland
= Area of gland exposed to fluid pressure × Fluid pressure
= π (dr + w) w.p = π (80 + 20) 20 × 16 = 100 544 N
Let us assume that 8 studs equally spaced on the pitch circle of the gland flange are used for
holding down the gland.
∴ Load on each stud = 100 544 / 8 = 12 568 N
If dc is the core diameter of the stud and σt is the permissible tensile stress for the stud material,
then
Load on each stud,
12 568 = 4
π  (dc)2 σt = 4
π  (dc)2 75 = 58.9 (dc)2
... (Taking σt = 75 N/mm2)
∴
(dc)2 = 12 568 / 58.9 = 213.4
or
dc = 14.6 mm
From fine series of metric threads, let us adopt the studs of size M 18 × 1.5 having major
diameter as 18 mm and core diameter (dc) as 16.16 mm. Ans.
The other dimensions for the gland are taken as follows:

Pitch circle diameter of the gland flange,
P.C.D. = DG + 3 dc = 120 + 3 × 16.16 = 168.48  or  168.5 mm Ans.
Outer diameter of the gland flange,
DF = DG + 6 dc = 120 + 6 × 16.16 = 216.96     or   217 mm Ans.
and  thickness of the gland flange = 1.5 dc = 1.5 × 16.16 = 24.24         or    24.5 mm Ans.
Example 7.13. A steel tube 240 mm external diameter is shrunk on another steel tube of 80 mm
internal diameter. After shrinking, the diameter at the junction is 160 mm. Before shrinking, the
difference of diameters at the junction was 0.08 mm. If the Young’s modulus for steel is 200 GPa,
find: 1. tangential stress at the outer surface of the inner tube; 2. tangential stress at the inner
surface of the outer tube ; and 3. radial stress at the junction.
Solution. Given: d3 = 240 mm or r3 = 120 mm ; d1 = 80 mm or r1 = 40 mm ; d2 = 160 mm or
r2 = 80 mm ; δd = 0.08 mm or δr = 0.04 mm ; E = 200 GPa = 200 kN/mm2 = 200 × 103 N/mm2
First of all, let us find the pressure developed at the junction. We know that the pressure
developed at the junction,

We know that the radial stress at the junction, (i.e. at the inner radius of the outer tube),
σro = – p = – 23.4 N/mm2 = 23.4 MPa (compressive) Ans.
Example 7.14. A shrink fit assembly, formed by shrinking one tube over another, is subjected to
an internal pressure of 60 N/mm2. Before the fluid is admitted, the internal and the external diameters
of the assembly are 120 mm and 200 mm and the diameter at the junction is 160 mm. If after shrinking
on, the contact pressure at the junction is 8 N/mm2, determine using Lame’s equations, the stresses at
the inner, mating and outer surfaces of the assembly after the fluid has been admitted.
Solution. Given : pi = 60 N/mm2 ; d1 = 120 mm or r1 = 60 mm ; d3 = 200 mm or r3 = 100 mm ;
d2 = 160 mm or r2 = 80 mm ; p = 8 N/mm2
First of all, let us find out the stresses induced in the assembly due to contact pressure at the
junction ( p).

7.12 Cylinder Heads and Cover Plates
The heads of cylindrical pressure vessels and the sides of rectangular or square tanks may have
flat plates or slightly dished plates. The plates
may either be cast integrally with the cylinder
walls or fixed by means of bolts, rivets or
welds. The design of flat plates forming the
heads depend upon the following two factors:
(a)
Type of connection between the
head and the cylindrical wall, (i.e.
freely supported or rigidly fixed);
and
(b)
Nature of loading (i.e. uniformly
distributed or concentrated).
Since the stress distribution in the
cylinder heads and cover plates are of
complex nature, therefore empirical relations
based on the work of Grashof and Bach are
used in the design of flat plates. Let us
consider the following cases:
1. Circular flat plate with uniformly distributed load. The thickness (t1 ) of a plate with a
diameter (d ) supported at the circumference and subjected to a pressure ( p) uniformly distributed
over the area is given by
t1 = k1.d 
t

σ
where
σt = Allowable design stress.
This  2500-ton hydraulic press is used to forge machine
parts a high temperature.

The coefficient k1 depends upon the material of the plate and the method of holding the edges.
The values of k1 for the cast iron and mild steel are given in Table 7.2.
2. Circular flat plate loaded centrally. The thickness (t1) of a flat cast iron plate supported

Introduction
The pipes are used for transporting various fluids like
water, steam, different types of gases, oil and other chemicals
with or without pressure from one place to another. Cast iron,
wrought iron, steel and brass are the materials generally used
for pipes in engineering practice. The use of cast iron pipes
is limited to pressures of about 0.7 N/mm2 because of its
low resistance to shocks which may be created due to the
action of water hammer. These pipes are best suited for water
and sewage systems. The wrought iron and steel pipes are
used chiefly for conveying steam, air and oil. Brass pipes, in
small sizes, finds use in pressure lubrication systems on prime
movers. These are made up and threaded to the same
standards as wrought iron and steel pipes. Brass pipe is not
liable to corrosion. The pipes used in petroleum industry are
generally seamless pipes made of heat-resistant chrome-
molybdenum alloy steel. Such type of pipes can resist
pressures more than 4 N/mm2 and temperatures greater than
440°C.

Stresses in Pipes
The stresses in pipes due to the internal fluid pressure are determined by Lame's equation as discussed

where
p = Internal fluid pressure in the pipe,
ri = Inner radius of the pipe, and
ro = Outer radius of the pipe.
The tangential stress is maximum at the inner surface (when x = ri) of the pipe and minimum at
the outer surface (when x = ro) of the pipe.
Substituting the values of x = ri and x = ro in
equation (i), we find that the maximum tangential
stress at the inner surface of the pipe,
σt(max) =

The radial stress is maximum at the inner
surface of the pipe and zero at the outer surface of
the pipe. Substituting the values of x = ri and x = ro
in equation (ii), we find that maximum radial stress
at the inner surface,
σr(max) =– p (compressive)
and minimum radial stress at the outer surface of the pipe,
σr(min) =0
The thick cylindrical formula may be applied when
(a)
the variation of stress across the thickness of the pipe is taken into account,
(b)
the internal diameter of the pipe (D) is less than twenty times its wall thickness (t), i.e.
D/t < 20, and
(c)
the allowable stress (σt) is less than six times the pressure inside the pipe ( p ) i.e.
σt / p < 6.

Design of Pipes
The design of a pipe involves the determination of inside diameter of the pipe and its wall
thickness as discussed below:
1. Inside diameter of the pipe. The inside diameter of the pipe depends upon the quantity of
fluid to be delivered.
Let
D = Inside diameter of the pipe,
v = Velocity of fluid flowing per minute, and
Q = Quantity of fluid carried per minute.
We know that the quantity of fluid flowing per minute,
Q = Area × Velocity =

2. Wall thickness of the pipe. After deciding upon
the inside diameter of the pipe, the thickness of the wall
(t) in order to withstand the internal fluid pressure ( p)
may be obtained by using thin cylindrical or thick
cylindrical formula.
The thin cylindrical formula may be applied when
(a)
the stress across the section of the pipe is
uniform,
(b)
the internal diameter of the pipe (D) is more
than twenty times its wall thickness (t), i.e.
D/t > 20, and
(c)
the allowable stress (σt) is more than six
times the pressure inside the pipe (p),
i.e. σt /p > 6.
According to thin cylindrical formula, wall thickness of pipe,

The velocity of flow is 30 m/s. Assuming the tensile stress as 40 MPa, find the inside diameter of the

Pipe Joints
The pipes are usually connected to vessels from which they transport the fluid. Since the length
of pipes available are limited, therefore various lengths of pipes have to be joined to suit any particular
installation. There are various forms of pipe joints used in practice, but most common of them are
discussed below.
1. Socket or a coupler joint. The most
common method of joining pipes is by means of a
socket or a coupler as shown in Fig. 8.2. A socket is
a small piece of pipe threaded inside. It is screwed
on half way on the threaded end of one pipe and the
other pipe is then screwed in the remaining half of
socket. In order to prevent leakage, jute or hemp is
wound around the threads at the end of each pipe.
This type of joint is mostly used for pipes carrying
water at low pressure and where the overall smallness
of size is most essential.
2. Nipple joint. In this type of joint, a nipple which is a small piece of pipe threaded outside is
screwed in the internally threaded end of each pipe, as shown in Fig. 8.3. The disadvantage of this
joint is that it reduces the area of flow.
Fig. 8.3. Nipple joint.
Fig. 8.4. Union joint.
3. Union joint. In order to disengage pipes joined by a socket, it is necessary to unscrew pipe
from one end. This is sometimes inconvenient when pipes are long.
The union joint, as shown in Fig. 8.4, provide the facility of disengaging the pipes by simply
unscrewing a coupler nut.

4. Spigot and socket joint. A spigot and socket joint as shown in Fig. 8.5, is chiefly used for
pipes which are buried in the earth. Some pipe lines are laid straight as far as possible. One of the
important features of this joint is its flexibility as it adopts itself
to small changes in level due to settlement of earth which takes
place due to climate and other conditions.
In this type of joint, the spigot end of one pipe fits into the
socket end of the other pipe. The remaining space between the
two is filled with a jute rope and a ring of lead. When the lead
solidifies, it is caulked-in tightly.
5. Expansion joint. The pipes carrying steam at high
pressures are usually joined by means of expansion joint. This
joint is used in steam pipes to take up expansion and contraction
of pipe line due to change of temperature.
In order to allow for change in length, steam pipes are not rigidly clamped but supported on
rollers. The rollers may be arranged on wall bracket, hangers or floor stands. The expansion bends, as
shown in Fig. 8.6 (a) and (b), are useful in a long pipe line. These pipe bends will spring in either
direction and readily accommodate themselves to small movements of the actual pipe ends to which
they are attached.
Fig. 8.6. Expansion bends.
Fig. 8.7. Expansion joints.
The copper corrugated expansion joint, as shown in Fig. 8.7 (a), is used on short lines and is
satisfactory for limited service. An expansion joint as shown in Fig. 8.7 (b) (also known as gland and
stuffing box arrangement), is the most satisfactory when the pipes are well supported and cannot sag.

6. Flanged joint. It is one of the most widely used pipe joint. A flanged joint may be made with
flanges cast integral with the pipes or loose flanges welded or screwed. Fig. 8.8 shows two cast iron
pipes with integral flanges at their ends. The flanges are connected by means of bolts. The flanges
have seen standardised for pressures upto
2 N/mm2. The flange faces are machined
to ensure correct alignment of the pipes.
The joint may be made leakproof by
placing a gasket of soft material, rubber
or convass between the flanges. The
flanges are made thicker than the pipe
walls, for strength. The pipes may be
strengthened for high pressure duty by
increasing the thickness of pipe for a short
length from the flange, as shown in Fig. 8.9.
For even high pressure and for large
diameters, the flanges are further strengthened by ribs or stiffners as shown in Fig. 8.10 (a). The ribs
are placed between the bolt holes.
Fig. 8.10
For larger size pipes, separate loose flanges screwed on the pipes as shown in Fig. 8.10 (b) are
used instead of integral flanges.

7. Hydraulic pipe joint. This type of joint has oval flanges and are fastened by means of two bolts,
as shown in Fig. 8.11. The oval flanges are usually used for small pipes, upto 175 mm diameter. The
flanges are generally cast integral with the pipe ends. Such joints are used to carry fluid pressure varying
from 5 to 14 N/mm2. Such a high pressure is found in hydraulic applications like riveting, pressing, lifts
etc. The hydraulic machines used in these installations are pumps, accumulators, intensifiers etc.

Standard Pipe Flanges for Steam
The Indian boiler regulations (I.B.R.) 1950 (revised 1961) have standardised all dimensions of
pipe and flanges based upon steam pressure. They have been divided into five classes as follows:
Class I : For steam pressures up to 0.35 N/mm2 and water pressures up to 1.4 N/mm2. This is
not suitable for feed pipes and shocks.
Class II : For steam pressures over 0.35 N/mm2 but not exceeding 0.7 N/mm2.
Class III : For steam pressures over 0.7 N/mm2 but not exceeding 1.05 N/mm2.
Class IV : For steam pressures over
1.05 N/mm2 but not exceeding 1.75 N/mm2.
Class V : For steam pressures from
1.75 N/mm2 to 2.45 N/mm2.
According to I.B.R., it is desirable that
for classes II, III, IV and V, the diameter of
flanges, diameter of bolt circles and number
of bolts should be identical and that
difference should consist in variations of the
thickness of flanges and diameter of bolts
only. The I.B.R. also recommends that all
nuts should be chamfered on the side bearing
on the flange and that the bearing surfaces
of the flanges, heads and nuts should be true.
The number of bolts in all cases should be a
multiple of four. The I.B.R. recommends that for 12.5 mm and 15 mm bolts, the bolt holes should be
1.5 mm larger and for higher sizes of bolts, the bolt holes should be 3 mm larger. All dimensions for
pipe flanges having internal diameters 1.25 mm to 600 mm are standardised for the above mentioned
classes (I to V). The flanged tees, bends are also standardised.
The  Trans-Alaska Pipeline was built to carry oil across the
frozen sub-Arctic landscape of North America.

Note: As soon as the size of pipe is determined, the rest of the dimensions for the flanges, bolts, bolt holes,
thickness of pipe may be fixed from standard tables. In practice, dimensions are not calculated on a rational
basis. The standards are evolved on the basis of long practical experience, suitability and interchangeability. The
calculated dimensions as discussed in the previous articles do not agree with the standards. It is of academic
interest only that the students should know how to use fundamental principles in determining various dimen-
sions e.g. wall thickness of pipe, size and number of bolts, flange thickness. The rest of the dimensions may be
obtained from standard tables or by empirical relations.
8.6
Hydraulic Pipe Joint for High Pressures
The pipes and pipe joints for high fluid pressure are classified as follows:
1. For hydraulic pressures up to 8.4 N/mm2 and pipe bore from 50 mm to 175 mm, the flanges
and pipes are cast integrally from remelted cast
iron. The flanges are made elliptical and secured
by two bolts. The proportions of these pipe joints
have been standardised from 50 mm to 175 mm,
the bore increasing by 25 mm. This category is
further split up into two classes:
(a)
Class A: For fluid pressures from
5 to 6.3 N/mm2, and
(b)
Class B: For fluid pressures from
6.3 to 8.4 N/mm2.
The flanges in each of the above classes
may be of two types. Type I is suitable for pipes
of 50 to 100 mm bore in class A, and for 50 to
175 mm bore in class B. The flanges of type II
are stronger than those of Type I and are usually
set well back on the pipe.
2. For pressures above 8.4 N/mm2 with
bores of 50 mm or below, the piping is of wrought
steel, solid drawn, seamless or rolled. The flanges
may be of cast iron, steel mixture or forged steel. These are screwed or welded on to the pipe and are
square in elevation secured by four bolts. These joints are made for pipe bores 12.5 mm to 50 mm
rising in increment of 3 mm from 12.5 to 17.5 mm and by 6 mm from 17.5 to 50 mm. The flanges and
pipes in this category are strong enough for service under pressures ranging up to 47.5 N/mm2.
In all the above classes, the joint is of the spigot and socket type made with a jointing ring of
gutta-percha.
Notes: The hydraulic pipe joints for high pressures differ from those used for low or medium pressure in the
following ways:
1. The flanges used for high pressure hydraulic pipe joints are heavy oval or square in form, They use two or
four bolts which is a great advantage while assembling and disassembling the joint especially in narrow space.
2. The bolt holes are made square with sufficient clearance to accomodate square bolt heads and to allow
for small movements due to setting of the joint.
3. The surfaces forming the joint make contact only through a gutta-percha ring on the small area provided
by the spigot and recess. The tightening up of the bolts squeezes the ring into a triangular shape and makes a
perfectly tight joint capable of withstanding pressure up to 47.5 N/mm2.
4. In case of oval and square flanged pipe joints, the condition of bending is very clearly defined due to
the flanges being set back on the pipe and thickness of the flange may be accurately determined to withstand the
bending action due to tightening of bolts.
Hydraulic pipe joints use two or four bolts which is
a great advantage while assembling the joint
especially in narrow space.

Design of Circular Flanged Pipe Joint
Consider a circular flanged pipe joint as shown in Fig. 8.8. In designing such joints, it is assumed
that the fluid pressure acts in between the flanges and tends to separate them with a pressure existing at
the point of leaking. The bolts are required to take up tensile stress in order to keep the flanges together.
The effective diameter on which the fluid pressure acts, just at the point of leaking, is the
diameter of a circle touching the bolt holes. Let this diameter be D1. If d1 is the diameter of bolt hole
and Dp is the pitch circle diameter, then
D1 = Dp – d1

where d1 is the diameter of the bolt hole. Also a bolt of less than 16 mm diameter should never be used
to make the joint leakproof.
The thickness of the flange is obtained by considering a segment of the flange as shown in Fig. 8.8 (b).
In this it is assumed that each of the bolt supports one segment. The effect of joining of these
segments on the stresses induced is neglected. The bending moment is taken about the section X-X,
which is tangential to the outside of the pipe. Let the width of this segment is x and the distance of this
section from the centre of the bolt is y.

Design of Oval Flanged Pipe Joint
Consider an oval flanged pipe joint as shown
in Fig. 8.11. A spigot and socket is provided for
locating the pipe bore in a straight line. A packing of
trapezoidal section is used to make the joint leak
proof. The thickness of the pipe is obtained as
discussed previously.
The force trying to separate the two flanges has
to be resisted by the stress produced in the bolts. If a
length of pipe, having its ends closed somewhere
along its length, be considered, then the force
separating the two flanges due to fluid pressure is
given by
F1 =

where
D = Internal diameter of the pipe.
The packing has also to be compressed to make the joint leakproof. The intensity of pressure
should be greater than the pressure of the fluid inside the pipe. For the purposes of calculations, it is
assumed that the packing material is compressed to the same pressure as that of inside the pipe.
Therefore the force tending to separate the flanges due to pressure in the packing is given by

should never be used for hydraulic pipes, because very heavy initial tightening stresses may be induced
in smaller bolts. The bolt centres should be as near the centre of the pipe as possible to avoid bending
of the flange. But sufficient clearance between the bolt head and pipe surface must be provided for
the tightening of the bolts without damaging the pipe material.
The thickness of the flange is obtained by considering the flange to be under bending stresses
due to the forces acting in one bolt. The maximum bending stress will be induced at the section X-X.

Armstrong's pipe joints. The various dimensions for a hydraulic joint may be obtained by using the
following empirical relations:
Nominal diameter of bolts, d =0.75 t + 10 mm
Thickness of the flange,
tf =1.5 t + 3 mm
Outer diameter of the flange,
Do =D + 2t + 4.6 d
Pitch circle diameter,
Dp =Do – (3 t + 20 mm)
Example 8.5. Design and draw an oval flanged pipe joint for a pipe having 50 mm bore. It is
subjected to an internal fluid pressure of 7 N/mm2. The maximum tensile stress in the pipe material is
not to exceed 20 MPa and in the bolts 60 MPa.
Solution. Given: D = 50 mm or R = 25 mm ; p = 7 N/mm2 ; σt = 20 MPa = 20 N/mm2 ;
σtb = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2

The elevation of the flange as shown in Fig. 8.13 (which is an ellipse) may now be drawn by
taking major axis as Do (i.e. 180 mm) and minor axis as (Dp – d) i.e. 124 – 22 = 102 mm. In order to
find thickness of the flange (tf), consider the section X-X. By measurement, we find that the width of
the flange at the section X-X,

Design of Square Flanged Pipe Joint
The design of a square flanged pipe joint, as shown in Fig. 8.14, is similar to that of an oval
flanged pipe joint except that the load has to be divided into four bolts. The thickness of the flange
may be obtained by considering the bending of the flange about one of the sections A-A, B-B, or C-C.
A little consideration will show that the flange is weakest in bending about section A-A.
Therefore the thickness of the flange is calculated by considering the bending of the flange, about
section A-A.

to an internal fluid pressure of 7 N/mm2. The maximum tensile stress in the pipe material is not to

Solution. Given: D = 50 mm or R = 25 mm ; p = 7 N/mm2 ; σt = 21 MPa = 21 N/mm2 ;
σtb = 28 MPa = 28 N/mm2

consider the bending of the flange about section

Introduction
A rivet is a short cylindrical bar with a head integral
to it. The cylindrical portion of
the rivet is called shank or body
and lower portion of shank is
known as tail, as shown in Fig.
9.1. The rivets are used to make
permanent fastening between the
plates such as in structural work,
ship building, bridges, tanks and
boiler shells. The riveted joints
are widely used for joining light
metals.
The fastenings (i.e. joints)
may be classified into the following two groups :
1.
Permanent fastenings, and
2.
Temporary or detachable fastenings.

The permanent fastenings are those fastenings which can not be disassembled without
destroying the connecting components. The examples of permanent fastenings in order of strength
are soldered, brazed, welded and riveted joints.
The temporary or detachable fastenings are those fastenings which can be disassembled
without destroying the connecting components. The examples of temporary fastenings are screwed,
keys, cotters, pins and splined joints.
9.2
Methods of Riveting
The function of rivets in a joint is to make a connection that has strength and tightness. The
strength is necessary to prevent failure of the joint. The tightness is necessary in order to contribute to
strength and to prevent leakage as in a boiler or in a ship hull.
When two plates are to be fastened together by a rivet as shown in Fig. 9.2 (a), the holes in the
plates are punched and reamed or drilled. Punching is the cheapest method and is used for relatively
thin plates and in structural work. Since punching injures the material around the hole, therefore
drilling is used in most pressure-vessel work. In structural and pressure vessel riveting, the diameter
of the rivet hole is usually 1.5 mm larger than the nominal diameter of the rivet.

Fig. 9.2. Methods of riveting.
The plates are drilled together and then separated to remove any burrs or chips so as to have a
tight flush joint between the plates. A cold rivet or a red hot rivet is introduced into the plates and the
point (i.e. second head) is then formed. When a cold rivet is used, the process is known as cold
riveting and when a hot rivet is used, the process is known as hot riveting. The cold riveting process
is used for structural joints while hot riveting is used to make leak proof joints.
A ship’s body is a combination of riveted, screwed and welded joints.
Contents
Top
Riveted Joints     283
The riveting may be done by hand or by a riveting machine. In hand riveting, the original rivet
head is backed up by a hammer or heavy bar and then the die or set, as shown in Fig. 9.2 (a), is placed
against the end to be headed and the blows are applied by a hammer. This causes the shank to expand
thus filling the hole and the tail is converted into a point as shown in Fig. 9.2 (b). As the rivet cools,
it tends to contract. The lateral contraction will be slight, but there will be a longitudinal tension
introduced in the rivet which holds the plates firmly together.
In machine riveting, the die is a part of the hammer which is operated by air, hydraulic or steam
pressure.
Notes : 1. For steel rivets upto 12 mm diameter, the cold riveting process may be used while for larger diameter
rivets, hot riveting process is used.
2. In case of long rivets, only the tail is heated and not the whole shank.
9.3
Material of Rivets
The material of the rivets must be tough and ductile. They are usually made of steel (low carbon
steel or nickel steel), brass, aluminium or copper, but when strength and a fluid tight joint is the main
consideration, then the steel rivets are used.
The rivets for general purposes shall be manufactured from steel conforming to the following
Indian Standards :
(a)
IS : 1148–1982 (Reaffirmed 1992) – Specification for hot rolled rivet bars (up to 40 mm
diameter) for structural purposes; or
(b)
IS : 1149–1982 (Reaffirmed 1992) – Specification for high tensile steel rivet bars for
structural purposes.
The rivets for boiler work shall be manufactured from material conforming to IS : 1990 – 1973
(Reaffirmed 1992) – Specification for steel rivets and stay bars for boilers.
Note : The steel for boiler construction should conform to IS : 2100 – 1970 (Reaffirmed 1992) – Specifica-
tion for steel billets, bars and sections for boilers.
9.4
Essential Qualities of a Rivet
According to Indian standard, IS : 2998 – 1982 (Reaffirmed 1992), the material of a rivet must
have a tensile strength not less than 40 N/mm2 and elongation not less than 26 percent. The material
must be of such quality that when in cold condition, the shank shall be bent on itself through 180°
without cracking and after being heated to 650°C and quenched, it must pass the same test. The rivet
when hot must flatten without cracking to a diameter 2.5 times the diameter of shank.
9.5
Manufacture of Rivets
According to Indian standard specifications, the rivets may be made either by cold heading or
by hot forging. If rivets are made by the cold heading process, they shall subsequently be adequately
heat treated so that the stresses set up in the cold heading process are eliminated. If they are made by
hot forging process, care shall be taken to see that the finished rivets cool gradually.
9.6
Types of Rivet Heads
According to Indian standard specifications, the rivet heads are classified into the following
three types :
1.  Rivet heads for general purposes (below 12 mm diameter) as shown in Fig. 9.3, according to

(also known as conoidal heads) are mainly used in case of hand hammering. The pan heads have
maximum strength, but these are difficult to shape.

Types of Riveted Joints
Following are the two types of riveted joints, depending upon the way in which the plates are
connected.
1.
Lap joint, and  2.  Butt joint.
Contents

286    A Textbook of Machine Design
9.8
Lap Joint
A lap joint is that in which one plate overlaps the other
and the two plates are then riveted together.
9.9
Butt Joint
A butt joint is that in which the main plates are kept in
alignment butting (i.e. touching) each other and a cover plate
(i.e. strap) is placed either on one side or on both sides of the
main plates. The cover plate is then riveted together with the
main plates. Butt joints are of the following two types :
1.
Single strap butt joint, and  2.  Double strap butt
joint.
In a single strap butt joint, the edges of the main plates
butt against each other and only one cover plate is placed on
one side of the main plates and then riveted together.
In a double strap butt joint, the edges of the main plates
butt against each other and two cover plates are placed on
both sides of the main plates and then riveted together.
In addition to the above, following are the types of riv-
eted joints depending upon the number of rows of the rivets.
1.
Single riveted joint, and  2.  Double riveted joint.
A single riveted joint is that in which there is a single row of rivets in a lap joint as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (a) and there is a single row of rivets on each side in a butt joint as shown in Fig. 9.8.
A double riveted joint is that in which there are two rows of rivets in a lap joint as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (b) and (c) and there are two rows of rivets on each side in a butt joint as shown in Fig. 9.9.

Similarly the joints may be triple riveted or quadruple riveted.
Notes : 1.  When the rivets in the various rows are opposite to each other, as shown in Fig. 9.6 (b), then the joint
is said to be chain riveted. On the other hand, if the rivets in the adjacent rows are staggered in such a way that
Contents

every rivet is in the middle of the two rivets of the opposite row as shown in Fig. 9.6 (c), then the joint is said to
be zig-zag riveted.
2.  Since the plates overlap in lap joints, therefore the force P, P acting on the plates [See Fig. 9.15 (a)] are
not in the same straight line but they are at a distance equal to the thickness of the plate. These forces will form
a couple which may bend the joint. Hence the lap joints may be used only where small loads are to be transmit-
ted. On the other hand, the forces P, P in a butt joint [See Fig. 9.15 (b)] act in the same straight line, therefore
there will be no couple. Hence the butt joints are used where heavy loads are to be transmitted.

9.10 Important Terms Used in Riveted Joints
The following terms in connection with the riveted joints are important from the subject point
of view :
1.  Pitch. It is the distance from the centre of one rivet to the centre of the next rivet measured
parallel to the seam as shown in Fig. 9.6. It is usually denoted by p.
2.  Back pitch. It is the perpendicular distance between the centre lines of the successive rows
as shown in Fig. 9.6. It is usually denoted by pb.
3.  Diagonal pitch. It is the distance between the centres of the rivets in adjacent rows of zig-zag
riveted joint as shown in Fig. 9.6. It is usually denoted by pd.
4.  Margin or marginal pitch. It is the distance between the centre of rivet hole to the nearest
edge of the plate as shown in Fig. 9.6. It is usually denoted by m.

9.11 Caulking and Fullering
In order to make the joints leak proof
or fluid tight in pressure vessels like steam
boilers, air receivers and tanks etc. a process
known as caulking is employed. In this
process, a narrow blunt tool called caulking
tool, about 5 mm thick and 38 mm in
breadth, is used. The edge of the tool is
ground to an angle of 80°. The tool is moved
after each blow along the edge of the plate,
which is planed to a bevel of 75° to 80° to
facilitate the forcing down of edge. It is seen
that the tool burrs down the plate at A in
Fig. 9.12 (a) forming a metal to metal joint.
In actual practice, both the edges at A and

B are caulked. The head of the rivets as shown at C are also turned down with a caulking tool to make
a joint steam tight. A great care is taken to prevent injury to the plate below the tool.
A more satisfactory way of making the joints staunch is known as fullering which has largely
superseded caulking. In this case, a fullering tool with a thickness at the end equal to that of the plate
is used in such a way that the greatest pressure due to the blows occur near the joint, giving a clean
finish, with less risk of damaging the plate. A fullering process is shown in Fig. 9.12 (b).
9.12 Failures of a Riveted Joint
A riveted joint may fail in the following ways :
1.  Tearing of the plate at an edge. A joint may fail due to tearing of the plate at an edge as
shown in Fig. 9.13. This can be avoided by keeping the margin, m = 1.5d, where d is the diameter of
the rivet hole.

Fig. 9.14. Tearing of the plate across the
                    rows of rivets.
2.  Tearing of the plate across a row of rivets.  Due to the tensile stresses in the main plates, the
main plate or cover plates may tear off across a row of rivets as shown in Fig. 9.14. In such cases, we
consider only one pitch length of the plate, since every rivet is responsible for that much length of the
plate only.
The resistance offered by the plate against tearing is known as tearing resistance or tearing
strength or tearing value of the plate.
Let
p = Pitch of the rivets,
d = Diameter of the rivet hole,
t = Thickness of the plate, and
σt = Permissible tensile stress for the plate material.
We know that tearing area per pitch length,
A t = ( p  –  d ) t
∴  Tearing resistance or pull required to tear off the plate per pitch length,
Pt = At.σt = (p – d)t.σt
When the tearing resistance (Pt) is greater than the applied load (P) per pitch length, then this
type of failure will not occur.
3.  Shearing of the rivets. The plates which are connected by the rivets exert tensile stress on
the rivets, and if the rivets are unable to resist the stress, they are sheared off as shown in Fig. 9.15.
Contents
Top
Riveted Joints     291
It may be noted that the rivets are in *single shear in a lap joint and in a single cover butt joint,
as shown in Fig. 9.15. But the rivets are in double shear in a double cover butt joint as shown in Fig.
9.16. The resistance offered by a rivet to be sheared off is known as shearing resistance or shearing
strength or shearing value of the rivet.
Fig. 9.15. Shearing of rivets.
Fig. 9.16. Shearing off a rivet in double cover butt joint.
Let
d = Diameter of the rivet hole,
τ = Safe permissible shear stress for the rivet material, and
n = Number of rivets per pitch length.
We know that shearing area,
As = 4
π  × d 2
...(In single shear)
= 2 × 4
π  × d 2
...(Theoretically, in double shear)
= 1.875 × 4
π  × d 2
...(In double shear, according to Indian
Boiler Regulations)
∴  Shearing resistance or pull required to shear off the rivet per pitch length,
Ps = n × 4
π  × d 2 × τ
...(In single shear)
= n × 2 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ
...(Theoretically, in double shear)
*
We have already discussed in Chapter 4 (Art. 4.8) that when the shearing takes place at one cross-section
of the rivet, then the rivets are said to be in single shear. Similarly, when the shearing takes place at two
cross-sections of the rivet, then the rivets are said to be in double shear.
Contents
Top
292    A Textbook of Machine Design
= n × 1.875 × 4
π  × d2 × τ ...(In double shear, according to Indian
Boiler Regulations)
When the shearing resistance (Ps) is greater than the applied load (P) per pitch length, then this
type of failure will occur.
4.  Crushing of the plate or rivets. Sometimes, the rivets do not actually shear off under the
tensile stress, but are crushed as shown in Fig. 9.17. Due to this, the rivet hole becomes of an oval
shape and hence the joint becomes loose. The failure of rivets in such a manner is also known as
bearing failure. The area which resists this action is the projected area of the hole or rivet on
diametral plane.
The resistance offered by a rivet to be crushed is known as crushing resistance or crushing
strength or bearing value of the rivet.
Let
d = Diameter of the rivet hole,
t = Thickness of the plate,
σc = Safe permissible crushing stress for the rivet or
plate material, and
n = Number of rivets per pitch length under crushing.
We know that crushing area per rivet (i.e. projected area per rivet),
Ac = d.t
∴  Total crushing area
= n.d.t
and crushing resistance or pull required to crush the rivet
per pitch length,
Pc = n.d.t.σc
When the crushing resistance (Pc) is greater than
the applied load (P) per pitch length, then this type of
failure will occur.
Note : The number of rivets under shear shall be equal to the
number of rivets under crushing.
9.13 Strength of a Riveted Joint
The strength of a joint may be defined as the maximum force, which it can transmit, without
causing it to fail. We have seen in Art. 9.12 that Pt, Ps and Pc are the pulls required to tear off the plate,
shearing off the rivet and crushing off the rivet. A little consideration will show that if we go on
increasing the pull on a riveted joint, it will fail when the least of these three pulls is reached, because
a higher value of the other pulls will never reach since the joint has failed, either by tearing off the
plate, shearing off the rivet or crushing off the rivet.
If the joint is continuous as in case of boilers, the strength is calculated per pitch length. But if
the joint is small, the strength is calculated for the whole length of the plate.
9.14 Efficiency of a Riveted Joint
The efficiency of a riveted joint is defined as the ratio of the strength of riveted joint to the
strength of the un-riveted or solid plate.
We have already discussed that strength of the riveted joint
= Least of Pt, Ps and Pc
Strength of the un-riveted or solid plate per pitch length,
P = p × t × σt

Example 9.1. A double riveted lap joint is made between 15 mm thick plates. The rivet diameter
and pitch are 25 mm and 75 mm respectively. If the ultimate stresses are 400 MPa in tension,
320 MPa in shear and 640 MPa in crushing, find the minimum force per pitch which will rupture
the joint.
If the above joint is subjected to a load such that the factor of safety is 4, find out the actual
stresses developed in the plates and the rivets.
Solution. Given : t = 15 mm ; d = 25 mm ; p = 75 mm ; σtu = 400 MPa = 400 N/mm2 ; τu = 320
MPa = 320 N/mm2 ; σcu = 640 MPa = 640 N/mm2
Minimum force per pitch which will rupture the joint
Since the ultimate stresses are given, therefore we shall find the ultimate values of the resistances
of the joint. We know that ultimate tearing resistance of the plate per pitch,
Ptu = (p – d)t × σtu = (75 – 25)15 × 400 = 300 000 N
Ultimate shearing resistance of the rivets per pitch,
Psu = n × 4
π  × d 2 × τu = 2 × 4
π  (25)2 320 = 314 200 N    ...(Q n = 2)
and ultimate crushing resistance of the rivets per pitch,
Pcu = n × d × t × σcu = 2 × 25 × 15 × 640 = 480 000 N
From above we see that the minimum force per pitch which will rupture the joint is 300 000 N
or 300 kN.
Ans.
Actual stresses produced in the plates and rivets
Since the factor of safety is 4, therefore safe load per pitch length of the joint
= 300 000/4 = 75 000 N
Let σta, τa and σca be the actual tearing, shearing and crushing stresses produced with a safe
load of 75 000 N in tearing, shearing and crushing.
We know that actual tearing resistance of the plates (Pta),
75 000 = ( p – d ) t × σta = (75 – 25)15 × σta = 750 σta
∴
σta = 75 000 / 750 = 100 N/mm2 = 100 MPa Ans.
Actual shearing resistance of the rivets (Psa),
75 000 = n × 4
π  × d 2 × τa = 2 × 4
π  (25)2 τa = 982 τa
∴
τa = 75000 / 982 = 76.4 N/mm2 = 76.4 MPa Ans.
and actual crushing resistance of the rivets (Pca),
75 000 = n × d × t × σca = 2 × 25 × 15 × σca = 750 σca
∴
σca = 75000 / 750 = 100 N/mm2 = 100 MPa
Ans.

(i)  Tearing resistance of the plate
We know that the tearing resistance of the plate per pitch length,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = (50 – 20) 6 × 120 = 21 600 N
(ii)  Shearing resistance of the rivet
Since the joint is a single riveted lap joint, therefore the strength of one rivet in single shear is
taken. We know that shearing resistance of one rivet,
Ps = 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 4
π  (20)2 90 = 28 278 N
(iii)  Crushing resistance of the rivet
Since the joint is a single riveted, therefore strength of one rivet is taken. We know that crushing
resistance of one rivet,
Pc = d × t × σc = 20 × 6 × 180 = 21 600 N
∴  Strength of the joint
= Least of Pt, Ps and Pc = 21 600 N
We know that strength of the unriveted or solid plate,

(ii)  Shearing resistance of the rivets
Since the joint is double riveted lap joint, therefore strength of two rivets in single shear is
taken. We know that shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = n × 4
π  × d2 × τ = 2 × 4
π  (20)2 90 = 56 556 N
(iii)  Crushing resistance of the rivet
Since the joint is double riveted, therefore strength of two rivets is taken. We know that crushing
resistance of rivets,
Pc = n × d × t × σc = 2 × 20 × 6 × 180 = 43 200 N

τ = 100 MPa;          σc = 150 MPa
Find the efficiency of joint, taking the strength of the rivet in double shear as twice than that of
single shear.
Solution. Given : t = 20 mm ; d = 25 mm ; p = 100 mm ; σt = 120 MPa = 120 N/mm2 ;
τ = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2 ; σc = 150 MPa = 150 N/mm2
First of all, let us find the tearing resistance of the plate, shearing resistance and crushing
resistance of the rivet.
(i)  Tearing resistance of the plate
We know that tearing resistance of the plate per pitch length,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = (100 – 25) 20 × 120 = 180 000 N
(ii)  Shearing resistance of the rivets
Since the joint is double riveted butt joint, therefore the strength of two rivets in double shear is
taken. We know that shearing resistance of the rivets,
                                            Ps = n × 2 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 2 × 2 × 4
π  (25)2 100 = 196 375 N

crushing resistance of the rivets,
                  Pc = n × d × t × σc = 2 × 25 × 20 × 150 = 150 000 N
∴  Strength of the joint
                         =  Least of Pt, Ps and  Pc

9.15 Design of Boiler Joints
The boiler has a longitudinal joint as well as
circumferential joint. The longitudinal joint is used to join the
ends of the plate to get the required diameter of a boiler. For
this purpose, a butt joint with two cover plates is used. The
Preumatic drill uses compressed air.

circumferential joint is used to get the required length of the boiler. For this purpose, a lap joint with
one ring overlapping the other alternately is used.
Since a boiler is made up of number of rings, therefore the longitudinal joints are staggered for
convenience of connecting rings at places where both longitudinal and circumferential joints occur.
9.16 Assumptions in Designing Boiler Joints
The following assumptions are made while designing a joint for boilers :
1.
The load on the joint is equally shared by all the rivets. The assumption implies that the
shell and plate are rigid and that all the deformation of the joint takes place in the rivets
themselves.
2.
The tensile stress is equally distributed over the section of metal between the rivets.
3.
The shearing stress in all the rivets is uniform.
4.
The crushing stress is uniform.
5.
There is no bending stress in the rivets.
6.
The holes into which the rivets are driven do not weaken the member.
7.
The rivet fills the hole after it is driven.
8.
The friction between the surfaces of the plate is neglected.
9.17 Design of Longitudinal Butt Joint for a Boiler
According to Indian Boiler Regulations (I.B.R), the following procedure should be adopted for
the design of longitudinal butt joint for a boiler.
1.  Thickness of boiler shell. First of all, the thickness of the boiler shell is determined by using
the thin cylindrical formula, i.e.
t =
.
2 σ × η
t
l
P D
 + 1 mm as corrosion allowance
where
t = Thickness of the boiler shell,
P = Steam pressure in boiler,
D = Internal diameter of boiler shell,
σt = Permissible tensile stress, and
ηl = Efficiency of the longitudinal joint.
The following points may be noted :
(a)
The thickness of the boiler shell should not be less than 7 mm.
(b)
The efficiency of the joint may be taken from the following table.

(c)
According to I.B.R., the factor of safety should not be less than 4. The following table
shows the values of factor of safety for various kind of joints in boilers.

2.  Diameter of rivets. After finding out the thickness of the boiler shell (t), the diameter of the
rivet hole (d) may be determined by using Unwin's empirical formula, i.e.
d = 6
t
(when t is greater than 8 mm)
But if the thickness of plate is less than 8 mm, then the diameter of the rivet hole may be
calculated by equating the shearing resistance of the rivets to crushing resistance. In no case, the
diameter of rivet hole should not be less than the thickness of the plate, because there will be danger
of punch crushing. The following table gives the rivet diameter corresponding to the diameter of rivet
hole as per IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996).

According to IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996), the table on the next page (Table 9.4) gives
the preferred length and diameter combination for rivets.
3.  Pitch of rivets. The pitch of the rivets is obtained by equating the tearing resistance of the
plate to the shearing resistance of the rivets. It may noted that
(a)
The pitch of the rivets should not be less than 2d, which is necessary for the formation
of head.
(b)
The maximum value of the pitch of rivets for a longitudinal joint of a boiler as per
I.B.R. is
pmax = C × t + 41.28 mm
where
t = Thickness of the shell plate in mm, and
C = Constant.
The value of the constant C is given in Table 9.5.

Note :  If the pitch of rivets as obtained by equating the tearing resistance to the shearing resistance is more than
pmax, then the value of pmax is taken.
4.  Distance between the rows of rivets. The distance between the rows of rivets as specified by
Indian Boiler Regulations is as follows :
(a)
For equal number of rivets in more than one row for lap joint or butt joint, the distance
between the rows of rivets (pb) should not be less than
0.33 p + 0.67 d, for zig-zig riveting, and
2 d, for chain riveting.
(b)
For joints in which the number of rivets in outer rows is half the number of rivets in inner
rows and if the inner rows are chain riveted, the distance between the outer rows and the
next rows should not be less than
0.33 p + 0.67    or   2 d, whichever is greater.
The distance between the rows in which there are full number of rivets shall not be less
than 2d.
(c)
For joints in which the number of rivets in outer rows is half the number of rivets in inner
rows and if the inner rows are zig-zig riveted, the distance between the outer rows and the
next rows shall not be less than 0.2 p + 1.15 d. The distance between the rows in which
there are full number of rivets (zig-zag) shall not be less than 0.165 p + 0.67 d.
Note :  In the above discussion, p is the pitch of the rivets in the outer rows.
5.  Thickness of butt strap. According to I.B.R., the thicknesses for butt strap (t1) are as given
below :

9.18 Design of Circumferential Lap Joint for a Boiler
The following procedure is adopted for the design of circumferential lap joint for a boiler.
1.  Thickness of the shell and diameter of rivets. The thickness of the boiler shell and the
diameter of the rivet will be same as for longitudinal joint.
2.  Number of rivets. Since it is a lap joint, therefore the rivets will be in single shear.

joint, but if more than one circumferential joints is used, then it is 62% for the intermediate joints.

5.  After finding out the number of rows, the type of the joint (i.e. single riveted or double
riveted etc.) may be decided. Then the number of rivets in a row and pitch may be re-adjusted. In
order to have a leak-proof joint, the pitch for the joint should be checked from Indian Boiler
Regulations.
6.  The distance between the rows of rivets (i.e. back pitch) is calculated by using the relations
as discussed in the previous article.
7.  After knowing the distance between the rows of rivets (pb), the overlap of the plate may be
fixed by using the relation,
Overlap = (No. of rows of rivets – 1) pb + m
where
m = Margin.
There are several ways of joining the longitudinal joint and the circumferential joint. One of the
methods of joining the longitudinal and circumferential joint is shown in Fig. 9.18.

Example 9.4.  A double riveted lap joint with zig-zag riveting is to be designed for 13 mm
thick plates. Assume
σt = 80 MPa ; τ = 60 MPa ; and σc = 120 MPa
State how the joint will fail and find the efficiency of the joint.
Solution. Given : t = 13 mm ; σt = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ;
σc = 120 MPa = 120 N/mm2
1.  Diameter of rivet
Since the thickness of plate is greater than 8 mm, therefore diameter of rivet hole,
d = 6 t  = 6 13  = 21.6 mm
From Table 9.3, we find that according to IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard size
of the rivet hole (d ) is 23 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 22 mm. Ans.

2.  Pitch of rivets
Let
p = Pitch of the rivets.
Since the joint is a double riveted lap joint with zig-zag riveting [See Fig. 9.6 (c)], therefore
there are two rivets per pitch length, i.e. n = 2. Also, in a lap joint, the rivets are in single shear.
We know that tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = ( p – d )t × σt = ( p – 23) 13 × 80 = ( p – 23) 1040 N
...(i)
and shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = n × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 2 × 4
π  (23)2 60 = 49 864 N
...(ii)
...(Q There are two rivets in single shear)
From equations (i) and (ii), we get
p – 23 = 49864 / 1040 = 48    or    p = 48 + 23 = 71 mm
The maximum pitch is given by,
pmax = C × t + 41.28 mm
From Table 9.5, we find that for 2 rivets per pitch length, the value of C is 2.62.
∴
pmax = 2.62 × 13 + 41.28 = 75.28 mm
Since pmax is more than p, therefore we shall adopt
p = 71 mm
Ans.
3.  Distance between the rows of rivets
We know that the distance between the rows of rivets (for zig-zag riveting),
pb = 0.33 p + 0.67 d = 0.33 × 71 + 0.67 × 23 mm
= 38.8 say 40 mm
Ans.
4.  Margin
We know that the margin,
m = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 23 = 34.5 say 35 mm
Ans.
Failure of the joint
Now let us find the tearing resistance of the plate, shearing resistance and crushing resistance of
the rivets.
We know that tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = (p – d) t × σt = (71 – 23)13 × 80 = 49 920 N
Shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = n × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 2 × 4
π  (23)2 60 = 49 864 N
and crushing resistance of the rivets,
Pc = n × d × t × σc = 2 × 23 × 13 × 120 = 71 760 N
     The least of Pt, Ps and Pc is  Ps = 49 864 N. Hence the joint will fail due to shearing of the
rivets. Ans.
Efficiency of the joint
We know that strength of the unriveted or solid plate,
P = p × t × σt = 71 × 13 × 80 = 73 840 N
∴  Efficiency of the joint,
η =
sP
P  = 49 864

Riveted Joints     303
Example 9.5.  Two plates of 7 mm thick
are connected by a triple riveted lap joint of
zig-zag pattern. Calculate the rivet diameter,
rivet pitch and distance between rows of
rivets for the joint. Also state the mode of
failure of the joint. The safe working stresses
are as follows :
σt = 90 MPa ; τ = 60 MPa ; and
σc = 120 MPa.
Solution.  Given : t = 7 mm ; σt = 90
MPa = 90 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ;
σc = 120 MPa = 120 N/mm2
1.  Diameter of rivet
Since the thickness of plate is less than
8 mm, therefore diameter of the rivet hole (d)
is obtained by equating the shearing resistance
(Ps) to the crushing resistance (Pc) of the
rivets. The triple riveted lap joint of zig-zag
pattern is shown in Fig. 9.7 (b). We see that
there are three rivets per pitch length (i.e.
n = 3). Also, the rivets in lap joint are in single
shear.
We know that shearing resistance of the
rivets,
Ps = n × 4
π  × d2 × τ
   = 3 × 4
π  × d 2 × 60 = 141.4 d 2 N ...(i)
...(Q n = 3)
and crushing resistance of the rivets,
Pc = n × d × t × σc = 3 × d × 7 × 120 = 2520 d N
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we get
141.4 d2 = 2520 d   or   d = 2520 / 141.4 = 17.8 mm
From Table 9.3, we see that according to IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of rivet hole (d ) is 19 mm and the corresponding diameter of rivet is 18 mm.
      Ans.
2. Pitch of rivets
Let
p = Pitch of rivets.
We know that tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = ( p – 19 ) 7 × 90 = 630 ( p – 19 ) N
...(iii)
and shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = 141.4 d 2 = 141.4 (19)2 = 51 045 N  ...[From equation (i)] ...(iv)
Equating equations (iii) and (iv), we get
630 ( p – 19 ) = 51 045
p – 19 = 51 045 / 630 = 81 or p = 81 + 19 = 100 mm

According to I.B.R., maximum pitch,
pmax = C.t + 41.28 mm
From Table 9.5, we find that for lap joint and 3 rivets per pitch length, the value of C is 3.47.
∴
pmax = 3.47 × 7 + 41.28 = 65.57 say 66 mm
Since pmax is less than p, therefore we shall adopt p = pmax = 66 mm
Ans.
3.  Distance between rows of rivets
We know that the distance between the rows of rivets for zig-zag riveting,
pb = 0.33 p + 0.67 d = 0.33 × 66 + 0.67 × 19 = 34.5 mm
Ans.
Mode of failure of the joint
We know that tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = (66 – 19) 7 × 90 = 29 610 N
Shearing resistance of rivets,
Ps = n × 4
π  × d 2 × τ  = 3 × 4
π  (19)2 60 = 51 045 N
and crushing resistance of rivets.
Pc = n × d × t × σc = 3 × 19 × 7 × 120 = 47 880 N
From above we see that the least value of Pt, Ps and Pc is Pt = 29 610 N. Therefore the joint will
fail due to tearing off the plate.
Example 9.6.  Two plates of 10 mm thickness each are to be joined by means of a single riveted
double strap butt joint. Determine the rivet diameter, rivet pitch, strap thickness and efficiency of the
joint. Take the working stresses in tension and shearing as 80 MPa and 60 MPa respectively.
Solution. Given : t = 10 mm ; σt = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2
1.  Diameter of rivet
Since the thickness of plate is greater than 8 mm, therefore diameter of rivet hole,
d = 6
t  = 6 10  = 18.97 mm
From Table 9.3, we see that according to IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of rivet hole ( d ) is 19 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 18 mm.
Ans.
2.  Pitch of rivets
Let
p = Pitch of rivets.
Since the joint is a single riveted double strap butt joint as shown in Fig. 9.8, therefore there is
one rivet per pitch length (i.e. n = 1) and the rivets are in double shear.
We know that tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = ( p – 19 )10 × 80 = 800 ( p – 19) N
...(i)
and shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = n × 1.875 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ
...(Q Rivets are in double shear)
= 1 × 1.875 × 4
π  (19)2 60 = 31 900 N
...(Q n = 1)  ...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we get
800 ( p – 19) = 31 900
∴
p – 19 = 31 900 / 800 = 39.87  or  p = 39.87 + 19 = 58.87 say 60 mm
According to I.B.R., the maximum pitch of rivets,
pmax = C.t + 41.28 mm
Contents
Top
Riveted Joints     305
From Table 9.5, we find that for double strap butt joint and 1 rivet per pitch length, the value of
C is 1.75.
∴
pmax = 1.75 × 10 + 41.28 = 58.78 say 60 mm
From above we see that p = pmax = 60 mm
Ans.
3.  Thickness of cover plates
We know that thickness of cover plates,
t1 = 0.625 t = 0.625 × 10 = 6.25 mm
Ans.
Efficiency of the joint
We know that tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = (60 – 19) 10 × 80 = 32 800 N
and shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = n × 1.875 × 4
π  × d2 × τ = 1 × 1.875 × 4
π  (19)2 60 = 31 900 N
∴  Strength of the joint
= Least of Pt and Ps = 31 900 N
Strength of the unriveted plate per pitch length

seam of a boiler shell 1.5 m in diameter subjected to a steam pressure of 0.95 N/mm2. Assume joint
efficiency as 75%, allowable tensile stress in the plate 90 MPa ; compressive stress 140 MPa ; and
shear stress in the rivet 56 MPa.
Solution. Given : D = 1.5 m = 1500 mm ; P = 0.95 N/mm2 ; ηl = 75% = 0.75 ; σt = 90 MPa
= 90 N/mm2 ; σc = 140 MPa = 140 N/mm2 ; τ = 56 MPa = 56 N/mm2

2.  Diameter of rivet
Since the thickness of the plate is greater than 8 mm, therefore the diameter of the rivet hole,
d = 6
t  = 6 12  = 20.8 mm
From Table 9.3, we see that according to IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of the rivet hole ( d ) is 21 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 20 mm.   Ans.
3.  Pitch of rivets
Let
p = Pitch of rivets.
The pitch of the rivets is obtained by equating the tearing resistance of the plate to the shearing
resistance of the rivets.
We know that tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = ( p – 21)12 × 90 = 1080 ( p – 21)N
...(i)
Since the joint is double riveted double strap butt joint, as shown in Fig. 9.9, therefore there are
two rivets per pitch length (i.e. n = 2) and the rivets are in double shear. Assuming that the rivets in
Contents
Top
306    A Textbook of Machine Design
double shear are 1.875 times stronger than in single shear, we have
Shearing strength of the rivets,
Ps = n × 1.875 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 2 × 1.875 × 4
π  (21)2 × 56 N
= 72 745 N
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we get
1080 ( p – 21) = 72 745
∴
p – 21 = 72 745 / 1080 = 67.35 or  p = 67.35 + 21 = 88.35 say 90 mm
According to I.B.R., the maximum pitch of rivets for longitudinal joint of a boiler is given by
pmax = C × t + 41.28 mm
From Table 9.5, we find that for a double riveted double strap butt joint and two rivets per pitch
length, the value of C is 3.50.
∴
pmax = 3.5 × 12 + 41.28 = 83.28 say 84 mm
Since the value of p is more than pmax, therefore we shall adopt pitch of the rivets,
p = pmax = 84 mm
Ans.
4.  Distance between rows of rivets
Assuming zig-zag riveting, the distance between the rows of the rivets (according to I.B.R.),
pb = 0.33 p + 0.67 d = 0.33 × 84 + 0.67 × 21 = 41.8 say 42 mm  Ans.
5. Thickness of cover plates
According to I.B.R., the thickness of each cover plate of equal width is
t1 = 0.625 t = 0.625 × 12 = 7.5 mm
Ans.
6.  Margin
We know that the margin,
m = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 21 = 31.5 say 32 mm
Ans.
Let us now find the efficiency for the designed joint.
Tearing resistance of the plate,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = (84 – 21)12 × 90 = 68 040 N
Shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = n × 1.875 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 2 × 1.875 × 4
π  (21)2 × 56 = 72 745 N
and crushing resistance of the rivets,
Pc = n × d × t × σc = 2 × 21 × 12 × 140 = 70 560 N
Since the strength of riveted joint is the least value of Pt, Ps or Pc, therefore strength of the
riveted joint,
Pt = 68 040 N
We know that strength of the un-riveted plate,
P = p × t × σt = 84 × 12 × 90 = 90 720 N
∴  Efficiency of the designed joint,
η =
68 040
90 720

P =

Ans.
Since the efficiency of the designed joint is equal to the given efficiency of 75%, therefore the

Riveted Joints     307
Example 9.8.  A pressure vessel has an internal
diameter of 1 m and is to be subjected to an internal pressure
of 2.75 N/mm2 above the atmospheric pressure. Considering
it as a thin cylinder and assuming efficiency of its riveted
joint to be 79%, calculate the plate thickness if the tensile
stress in the material is not to exceed 88 MPa.
Design a longitudinal double riveted double strap butt
joint with equal straps for this vessel. The pitch of the rivets
in the outer row is to be double the pitch in the inner row
and zig-zag riveting is proposed. The maximum allowable
shear stress in the rivets is 64 MPa. You may assume that
the rivets in double shear are 1.8 times stronger than in
single shear and the joint does not fail by crushing.
Make a sketch of the joint showing all calculated
values. Calculate the efficiency of the joint.
Solution. Given : D = 1 m = 1000 mm ; P = 2.75
N/mm2 ; ηl = 79% = 0.79 ; σt = 88 MPa = 88 N/mm2;
τ = 64 MPa = 64 N/mm2

2.  Diameter of rivet
Since the thickness of plate is more than 8 mm, therefore diameter of rivet hole,
d = 6
t  = 6
21  = 27.5 mm
From Table 9.3, we see that according to IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of the rivet hole ( d ) is 28.5 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 27 mm.   Ans.
3.  Pitch of rivets
Let
p = Pitch in the outer row.
The pitch of the rivets is obtained by equating the tearing resistance of the plate to the shearing
resistance of the rivets.
We know that the tearing resistance of the plate per pitch length,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = ( p – 28.5 ) 21 × 88 = 1848 ( p – 28.5) N    ...(i)
Since the pitch in the outer row is twice the pitch of the inner row and the joint is double riveted,
therefore for one pitch length there will be three rivets in double shear (i.e. n = 3). It is given that the
strength of rivets in double shear is 1.8 times that of single shear, therefore
Shearing strength of the rivets per pitch length,

According to I.B.R., the maximum pitch,
pmax = C × t + 41.28 mm
From Table 9.5, we find that for 3 rivets per pitch length and for double strap butt joint, the
value of C is 4.63.
∴
pmax = 4.63 × 21 + 41.28 = 138.5 say 140 mm
Since the value of pmax is less than p, therefore we shall adopt the value of
p = pmax = 140 mm

Since the efficiency of the designed joint is more than the given efficiency, therefore the design
is satisfactory.
Example 9.9.  Design the longitudinal joint for a 1.25 m diameter steam boiler to carry a
steam pressure of 2.5 N/mm2. The ultimate strength of the boiler plate may be assumed as 420 MPa,
crushing strength as 650 MPa and shear strength as 300 MPa. Take the joint efficiency as 80%.
Sketch the joint with all the dimensions. Adopt the suitable factor of safety.
Solution. Given : D = 1.25 m = 1250 mm; P = 2.5 N/mm2 ; σtu = 420 MPa = 420 N/mm2;
σcu = 650 MPa = 650 N/mm2 ; τu = 300 MPa = 300 N/mm2 ; ηl = 80% = 0.8

d = 6
t  = 6
25  = 30 mm
From Table 9.3, we see that according to IS : 1928 – 1961 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of the rivet hole is 31.5 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 30 mm.     Ans.
3.  Pitch of rivets
Assume a triple riveted double strap butt joint with unequal straps, as shown in Fig. 9.11.
Let
p = Pitch of the rivets in the outer most row.
∴  Tearing strength of the plate per pitch length,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = ( p – 31.5) 25 × 84 = 2100 ( p – 31.5 ) N    ...(i)
Since the joint is triple riveted with two unequal cover straps, therefore there are 5 rivets per
pitch length. Out of these five rivets, four rivets are in double shear and one is in single shear.
Assuming the strength of the rivets in double shear as 1.875 times that of single shear, therefore
Shearing resistance of the rivets per pitch length,
Ps = 4 × 1.875 × 4
π  × d2 × τ + 4
π  × d2 × τ  = 8.5 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ
= 8.5 × 4
π  (31.5)2 60 = 397 500 N
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we get
2100 ( p – 31.5) = 397 500
∴
p – 31.5 = 397 500 / 2100 = 189.3 or p = 31.5 + 189.3 = 220.8 mm
According to I.B.R., maximum pitch,
pmax = C × t + 41.28 mm
From Table 9.5, we find that for double strap butt joint with 5 rivets per pitch length, the value
of C is 6.
∴
pmax = 6 × 25 + 41.28 = 191.28 say 196 mm
Ans.
Since pmax is less than p, therefore we shall adopt p = pmax = 196 mm

5.  Thickness of butt straps
We know that  for unequal width of butt straps, the thicknesses are as follows :
For wide butt strap,
t1 = 0.75 t = 0.75 × 25 = 18.75 say 20 mm
Ans.
and for narrow butt strap,
t2 = 0.625 t = 0.625 × 25 = 15.6 say 16 mm
Ans.
It may be noted that wide and narrow butt straps are placed on the inside and outside of the shell
respectively.
6.  Margin
We know that the margin,
m = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 31.5 = 47.25 say 47.5 mm
Ans.
Let us now check the efficiency of the designed joint.
Tearing resistance of the plate in the outer row,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = (196 – 31.5) 25 × 84 = 345 450 N
Shearing resistance of the rivets,
Ps = 4 × 1.875 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ + 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 8.5 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ
= 8.5 × 4
π  (31.5)2 × 60 = 397 500 N
and crushing resistance of the rivets,
Pc = n × d × t × σc = 5 × 31.5 × 25 × 130 = 511 875 N   ...(Q n = 5)
The joint may also fail by tearing off the plate between the rivets in the second row. This is only
possible if the rivets in the outermost row gives way (i.e. shears). Since there are two rivet holes per
pitch length in the second row and one rivet is in the outer most row, therefore combined tearing and
shearing resistance
= ( p – 2d ) t × σt + 4
π  × d 2 × τ
= (196 – 2 × 31.5) 25 × 84 + 4
π  (31.5)2 60 = 326 065 N
From above, we see that strength of the joint
= 326 065 N
Strength of the unriveted or solid plate,
P = p × t × σt = 196 × 25 × 84 = 411 600 N
∴  Efficiency of the joint,
η = 326 065 / 411 600 = 0.792 or 79.2%
Since the efficiency of the designed joint is nearly equal to the given efficiency, therefore the
design is satisfactory.
Example 9.10.  A steam boiler is to be designed for a working pressure of 2.5 N/mm2 with its
inside diameter 1.6 m. Give the design calculations for the longitudinal and circumferential joints
for the following working stresses for steel plates and rivets :
In tension = 75 MPa ; In shear = 60 MPa; In crushing = 125 MPa.
Draw the joints to a suitable scale.
Solution. Given : P = 2.5 N/mm2 ; D = 1.6 m = 1600 mm ; σt = 75 MPa = 75 N/mm2 ;
τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ; σc = 125 MPa = 125 N/mm2

diameter of rivet hole (d ) is 34.5 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 33 mm.     Ans.
3.  Pitch of rivets
Assume the joint to be triple riveted double strap butt joint with unequal cover straps, as shown
in Fig. 9.11.
Let
p = Pitch of the rivet in the outer most row.
∴Tearing resistance of the plate per pitch length,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = ( p – 34.5) 28 × 75 N
= 2100 (p – 34.5 ) N
...(i)
Since the joint is triple riveted with two unequal cover straps, therefore there are 5 rivets per
pitch length. Out of these five rivets, four are in double shear and one is in single shear. Assuming the
strength of rivets in double shear as 1.875 times that of single shear, therefore
Shearing resistance of the rivets per pitch length,
Ps = 4 × 1.875 × 4

π  × d 2 × τ
= 8.5 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ

π  (34.5)2 60 = 476 820 N
...(ii)
Equating equations (i) and (ii), we get
2100 ( p – 34.5) = 476 820
∴
p – 34.5 = 476 820 / 2100 = 227  or  p = 227 + 34.5 = 261.5 mm
According to I.B.R., the maximum pitch,
pmax = C.t + 41.28 mm
From Table 9.5, we find that for double strap butt joint with 5 rivets per pitch length, the value
of C is 6.
∴
pmax = 6 × 28 + 41.28 = 209.28 say 220 mm

We know that the margin,
m = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 34.5 = 51.75 say 52 mm

Let us now check the efficiency of the designed joint.
Tearing resistance of the plate in the outer row,
Pt = ( p – d ) t × σt = (220 – 34.5) 28 × 75 = 389 550 N
Shearing resistance of the rivets,

and crushing resistance of the rivets,
Pc = n × d × t × σc = 5 × 34.5 × 28 × 125 = 603 750 N
The joint may also fail by tearing off the plate between the rivets in the second row. This is only
possible if the rivets in the outermost row gives way (i.e. shears). Since there are two rivet holes per
pitch length in the second row and one rivet in the outermost row, therefore
Combined tearing and shearing resistance

π  (34.5)2 60

From above, we see that the strength of the joint

Strength of the unriveted or solid plate,
P = p × t × σt = 220 × 28 × 75 = 462 000 N

of the plate at the outer row which has only one rivet.

and
n = Number of rivets.
Since the joint is double strap butt joint, therefore the rivets are in double shear. It is assumed
that resistance of a rivet in double shear is 1.75 times than in single shear in order to allow for possible
eccentricity of load and defective workmanship.

4.  Thickness of the butt straps
The thickness of the butt strap,

= 0.75 t, for double cover strap
5.  Efficiency of the joint
First of all, calculate the resistances along the sections 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3.
At section 1-1, there is only one rivet hole.
∴  Resistance of the joint in tearing along 1-1,
Pt1 = (b – d ) t × σt
At section 2-2, there are two rivet holes.
∴  Resistance of the joint in tearing along 2-2,
Pt2 = (b – 2d ) t × σt + Strength of one rivet in front of section 2-2
(This is due to the fact that for tearing off the plate at section 2-2, the rivet in front of section
2-2 i.e. at section 1-1 must first fracture).
Similarly at section 3-3 there are three rivet holes.
∴  Resistance of the joint in tearing along 3-3,
Pt3 = (b – 3d ) t × σt + Strength of 3 rivets in front of section 3-3
The least value of Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, Ps or Pc is the strength of the joint.

are to be connected by means of a butt joint with double cover plates. Design the joint if the
permissible stresses are 80 MPa in tension, 65 MPa in shear and 160 MPa in crushing. Make a
sketch of the joint.
Solution.  Given : b = 200 mm ; t = 12.5 mm ; σt = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; τ = 65 MPa = 65 N/mm2 ;

2.  Number of rivets
Let
n = Number of rivets.
We know that maximum pull acting on the joint,
Pt = (b – d ) t × σt = (200 – 21.5) 12.5 × 80 = 178 500 N
Since the joint is a butt joint with double cover plates as shown in Fig. 9.20, therefore the rivets
are in double shear. Assume that the resistance of the rivet in double shear is 1.75 times than in single
shear.
∴  Shearing resistance of one rivet,
Ps = 1.75 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 1.75 × 4
π  (21.5)2 65 = 41 300 N
and crushing resistance of one rivet,
Pc = d × t × σc = 21.5 × 12.5 × 160 = 43 000 N

At section 1-1, there is only one rivet hole.
∴  Resistance of the joint in tearing along section 1-1,
Pt1 = ( b – d ) t × σt = (200 – 21.5) 12.5 × 80 = 178 500 N
At section 2-2, there are two rivet holes. In this case, the tearing of the plate will only take place
if the rivet at section 1-1 (in front of section 2-2) gives way (i.e. shears).
∴ Resistance of the joint in tearing along section 2-2,
Pt2 = (b – 2d ) t × σt + Shearing resistance of one rivet
= (200 – 2 × 21.5 ) 12.5 × 80 + 41 300 = 198 300 N
At section 3-3, there are two rivet holes. The tearing of the plate will only take place if one rivet
at section 1-1 and two rivets at section 2-2 gives way (i.e. shears).
∴ Resistance of the joint in tearing along section 3-3,
Pt3 = ( b – 2d ) t × σt + Shearing resistance of 3 rivets
= (200 – 2 × 21.5) 12.5 × 80 + 3 × 41 300 = 280 900 N
Shearing resistance of all the 5 rivets
Ps = 5 × 41 300 = 206 500 N
and crushing resistance of all the 5 rivets,
Pc = 5 × 43 000 = 215 000 N

Since the strength of the joint is the least value of Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, Ps and Pc, therefore strength of
the joint

connected to a gusset plate of the same thickness by a double cover butt joint. Design an economical
joint if the permissible stresses are :
σt = 90 MPa, τ = 60 MPa and σc = 150 MPa
Solution. Given : b = 350 mm ; t = 20 mm ; σt = 90 MPa = 90 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ;
σc = 150 MPa = 150 N/mm2

From Table 9.7, we see that according to IS : 1929–1982 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard

2.  Number of rivets
Let
n = Number of rivets.
We know that the maximum pull acting on the joint,
Pt = ( b – d ) t × σt = (350 – 29) 20 × 90 = 577 800 N
Since the joint is double strap butt joint, therefore the rivets are in double shear. Assume that the
resistance of the rivet in double shear is 1.75 times than in single shear.
∴  Shearing resistance of one rivet,
Ps = 1.75 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 1.75 × 4
π  (29)2 60 = 69 360 N
and crushing resistance of one rivet,
Pc = d × t × σc = 29 × 20 × 150 = 87 000 N

5.  Efficiency of the johint
First of all, let us find the resistances along the sections 1-1, 2-2, 3-3 and 4-4.
At section 1-1, there is only one rivet hole.
∴ Resistance of the joint in tearing along 1-1,
Pt1 = (b – d ) t × σt = (350 – 29) 20 × 90 = 577 800 N
At section 2-2, there are two rivet holes. In this case the tearing of the plate will only take place
if the rivet at section 1-1 (in front of section 2-2) gives way.
∴ Resistance of the joint in tearing along 2-2,
Pt2 = (b – 2d ) t × σt + Shearing strength of one rivet in front
= (350 – 2 × 29) 20 × 90 + 69 360 = 594 960 N
At section 3-3, there are three rivet holes. The tearing of the plate will only take place if one
rivet at section 1-1 and two rivets at section 2-2 gives way.
∴  Resistance of the joint in tearing along 3-3,
Pt3 = (b – 3d ) t × σt + Shearing strength of 3 rivets in front.
= (350 – 3 × 29) 20 × 90 + 3 × 69 360 = 681 480 N
Similarly, resistance of the joint in tearing along 4-4,
Pt4 = (b – 3d ) t × σt + Shearing strength of 6 rivets in front
= (350 – 3 × 29) 20 × 90 + 6 × 69 360 = 889 560 N
Shearing resistance of all the 9 rivets,
Ps = 9 × 69 360 = 624 240 N
and crushing resistance of all the 9 rivets,
Pc = 9 × 87 000 = 783 000 N
The strength of the joint is the least of Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, Pt4, Ps and Pc.
∴  Strength of the joint
= 577 800 N along section 1-1
We know that the strength of the un-riveted plate,
P = b × t × σt = 350 × 20 × 90 = 630 000 N
∴  Efficiency of the joint,
η =

Ans.
7.  Marginal pitch,
m = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 29 = 43.5 say 45 mm
Ans.
8. Distance between the rows of rivets
= 2.5 d = 2.5 × 29 = 72.5 say 75 mm
Ans.
Note :  If chain riveting with three rows of three rivets in each is used instead of diamond riveting, then
Least strength of the joint
= (b – 3 d ) t × σt = (350 – 3 × 29) 20 × 90 = 473 400 N
∴  Efficiency of the joint
= 473 400
630 000  = 0.752 or 75.2%
Thus we see that with the use of diamond riveting, efficiency of the joint is increased.

Example 9.13.  Design a lap joint for a mild steel flat tie-bar 200 mm × 10 mm thick, using 24
mm diameter rivets. Assume allowable stresses in tension and compression of the plate material as
112 MPa and 200 MPa respectively and shear stress of the rivets as 84 MPa. Show the disposition of
the rivets for maximum joint efficiency and determine the joint efficiency. Take diameter of rivet hole
as 25.5 mm for a 24 mm diameter rivet.
Solution. Given : b = 200 mm; t = 10 mm ; σt = 112 MPa = 112 N/mm2 ; σc = 200 MPa =

We know that the maximum pull acting on the joint,

Since the joint is a lap joint, therefore shearing resistance of one rivet,

π  × d2 × τ = 4
π  (25.5)2 84 = 42 905 N
and crushing resistance of one rivet,

Ans.
4.  Efficiency of the joint
First of all, let us find the resistances along the sections 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3. At section 1-1, there is
only one rivet hole.
∴  Resistance of the joint in tearing along section 1-1,
Pt1 = (b – d ) t × σt = (200 – 25.5) 10 × 112 = 195 440 N
At section 2-2, there are three rivet holes. In this case, the tearing of the plate will only take
place if the rivet at section 1-1 (in front of section 2-2) gives way (i.e. shears).

∴  Resistance of the joint in tearing along section 2-2,
Pt2 = (b – 3d) t × σt + Shearing resistance of one rivet
= (200 – 3 × 25.5) 10 × 112 + 42 905 = 181 285 N
At section 3-3, there is only one rivet hole. The resistance of the joint in tearing along section
3-3 will be same as at section 1-1.
Pt3 = Pt1 = 195 440 N
Shearing resistance of all the five rivets,
Ps = 5 × 42 905 = 214 525 N
and crushing resistance of all the five rivets,
Pc = 5 × 51 000 = 525 000 N
Since the strength of the joint is the least value of Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, Ps and Pc, therefore strength of
the joint
= 181 285 N at section 2-2
We know that strength of the un-riveted plate

9.21 Eccentric Loaded Riveted Joint
When the line of action of the load does not pass through the centroid of the rivet system and
thus all rivets are not equally loaded, then the joint is said to be an eccentric loaded riveted joint, as
shown in Fig. 9.23 (a). The eccentric loading results in secondary shear caused by the tendency of
force to twist the joint about the centre of gravity in addition to direct shear or primary shear.
Let
P = Eccentric load on the joint, and
e = Eccentricity of the load i.e. the distance between the line of
action of the load and the centroid of the rivet system i.e. G.
The following procedure is adopted for the design of an eccentrically loaded riveted joint.

2.  Introduce two forces P1 and P2 at the centre of gravity ‘G’ of the rivet system. These forces
are equal and opposite to P as shown in Fig. 9.23 (b).
3.  Assuming that all the rivets are of the same size, the effect of P1 = P is to produce direct shear
load on each rivet of equal magnitude. Therefore, direct shear load on each rivet,
Ps =
P
n , acting parallel to the load P.
Contents

4.  The effect of P2 = P is to produce a turning moment of magnitude P × e which tends to rotate
the joint about the centre of gravity ‘G’ of the rivet system in a clockwise direction. Due to the turning
moment, secondary shear load on each rivet is produced. In order to find the secondary shear load,
the following two assumptions are made :
(a)
The secondary shear load is proportional to the radial distance of the rivet under
consideration from the centre of gravity of the rivet system.
(b)
The direction of secondary shear load is perpendicular to the line joining the centre of the
rivet to the centre of gravity of the rivet system..
Let
F1, F2, F3 ... = Secondary shear loads on the rivets 1, 2, 3...etc.
l1, l2, l3 ... = Radial distance of the rivets 1, 2, 3 ...etc. from the centre of
gravity ‘G’ of the rivet system.
∴  From assumption (a),
F1 ∝l1 ; F2 ∝ l2 and so on

We know that the sum of the external turning moment due to the eccentric load and of internal

∴

From the above expression, the value of F1 may be calculated and hence F2 and F3 etc. are
known. The direction of these forces are at right angles to the lines joining the centre of rivet to the
centre of gravity of the rivet system, as shown in Fig. 9.23 (b), and should produce the moment in the
same direction (i.e. clockwise or anticlockwise) about the centre of gravity, as the turning moment
(P × e).
5.  The primary (or direct) and secondary shear load may be added vectorially to determine the
resultant shear load (R) on each rivet as shown in Fig. 9.23 (c). It may also be obtained by using the
relation

where
θ = Angle between the primary or direct shear load (Ps) and
secondary shear load (F).
When the secondary shear load on each rivet is equal, then the heavily loaded rivet will be one
in which the included angle between the direct shear load and secondary shear load is minimum. The
maximum loaded rivet becomes the critical one for determining the strength of the riveted joint.
Knowing the permissible shear stress (τ), the diameter of the rivet hole may be obtained by using the
relation,
Maximum resultant shear load (R) = 4
π  × d 2 × τ
From Table 9.7, the standard diameter of the rivet hole ( d ) and the rivet diameter may be
specified, according to IS : 1929 – 1982 (Reaffirmed 1996).

Notes : 1.  In the solution of a problem, the primary and shear loads may be laid off approximately to scale and
generally the rivet having the maximum resultant shear load will be apparent by inspection. The values of the
load for that rivet may then be calculated.
2.  When the thickness of the plate is given, then the diameter of the rivet hole may be checked against
crushing.
3.  When the eccentric load P is inclined at some angle, then the same procedure as discussed above may
be followed to find the size of rivet (See Example 9.18).

Permissible shear stress is 65 MPa and crushing stress is 120 MPa. Determine the size of the
rivets to be used for the joint.
Solution. Given : t = 25 mm ; P = 50 kN = 50 × 103 N ; e = 400 mm ; n = 7 ; τ = 65 MPa

The resultant shear load may be determined graphically, as shown in Fig. 9.26.
From above we see that the maximum resultant shear load is on rivet 5. If d is the diameter of
rivet hole, then maximum resultant shear load (R5),
33 121 = 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 4
π  × d 2 × 65 = 51 d 2
∴
d 2 = 33 121 / 51 = 649.4   or  d = 25.5 mm
From Table 9.7, we see that according to IS : 1929–1982 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of the rivet hole (d ) is 25.5 mm and the corresponding diameter of rivet is 24 mm.
Let us now check the joint for crushing stress. We know that

= 51.95 N/mm2 = 51.95 MPa
Since this stress is well below the given crushing stress of 120 MPa, therefore the design is
satisfactory.

Example 9.15.  The bracket as shown in Fig. 9.27, is to carry a load of 45 kN. Determine the
size of the rivet if the shear stress is not to exceed 40 MPa. Assume all rivets of the same size.
Solution. Given : P = 45 kN = 45 × 103 N ; τ = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2 ; e = 500 mm; n = 9
Fig. 9.27
Fig. 9.28
First of all, let us find the centre of gravity of the rivet system.
Since all the rivets are of same size and placed symmetrically, therefore the centre of gravity of
the rivet system lies at G (rivet 5) as shown in Fig. 9.28.
We know that direct shear load on each rivet,
                                    Ps = P / n = 45 × 103 / 9 = 5000 N
The direct shear load acts parallel to the direction of load P, i.e. vertically downward as shown
in the figure.
Turning moment produced by the load P due to eccentricity e
                                          =P.e = 45 × 103 × 500 = 22.5 × 106 N-mm
This turning moment tends to rotate the joint about the centre of gravity (G) of the rivet system
in a clockwise direction. Due to this turning moment, secondary shear load on each rivet is produced.
It may be noted that rivet 5 does not resist any moment.
Let F1, F2, F3, F4, F6, F7, F8 and F9 be the secondary shear load on rivets 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and
9 at distances l1, l2, l3, l4, l6, l7, l8 and l9 from the centre of gravity (G) of the rivet system as shown in
Fig. 9.28. From the symmetry of the figure, we find that
                                      l1 = l3 = l7 = l9 =

The secondary shear loads acts perpendicular to the line joining the centre of rivet and the
centre of gravity of the rivet system, as shown in Fig. 9.28 and their direction is clockwise.
By drawing the direct and secondary shear loads on each rivet, we see that the rivets 3, 6 and 9
are heavily loaded. Let us now find the angle between the direct and secondary shear loads for these
rivets. From the geometry of the figure, we find that

The resultant shear load (R3 or R9) may be determined graphically as shown in Fig. 9.28.
From above we see that the maximum resultant shear load is on rivets 3 and 9.
If d is the diameter of the rivet hole, then maximum resultant shear load (R3),
                             26 600 =  4
π  × d 2 × τ = 4
π  × d 2 × 40 = 31.42 d 2
∴                                 d 2 = 26 600 / 31.42 = 846   or   d = 29 mm
From Table 9.7, we see that according to IS : 1929 – 1982 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of the rivet hole (d ) is 29 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 27 mm.   Ans.
Example 9.16.  Find the value of P for the joint shown in Fig. 9.29 based on a working shear
stress of 100 MPa for the rivets. The four rivets are equal, each of 20 mm diameter.

The direct shear load on each rivet acts in the direction of the load P, as shown in Fig. 9.30. The
centre of gravity of the rivet group will lie at E (because of symmetry). From Fig. 9.30, we find that

EC = e = 100 mm
∴   Turning moment produced by the load at the centre of gravity (E) of the rivet system due to
eccentricity
= P.e = P × 100 N-mm (anticlockwise)
This turning moment is resisted by four rivets as shown in Fig. 9.30. Let FA, FB, FC and FD be
the secondary shear load on the rivets, A, B, C, and D placed at distances lA, lB, lC and lD respectively
from the centre of gravity of the rivet system.

The secondary shear loads on each rivet act at right angles to the lines joining the centre of the
rivet to the centre of gravity of the rivet system as shown in Fig. 9.30.
Now let us find out the resultant shear load on each rivet. From Fig. 9.30, we find that
Resultant load on rivet A,
RA = Ps – FA = 0.25 P – 0.15 P = 0.10 P
Contents
Top
332    A Textbook of Machine Design
Resultant load on rivet B,
RB = Ps – FB = 0.25 P – 0.05 P = 0.20 P
Resultant load on rivet C,
RC = Ps + FC = 0.25 P + 0.05 P = 0.30 P
and resultant load on rivet D,
RD = Ps + FD = 0.25 P + 0.15 P = 0.40 P
From above we see that the maximum shear load is on rivet D. We know that the maximum
shear load (RD),
0.40 P = 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 4
π  (20)2 100 = 31 420
∴
P = 31 420 / 0.40 = 78 550 N = 78.55 kN
Ans.
Example 9.17.  A bracket is riveted to a column by 6 rivets of equal size as shown in Fig. 9.31.
It carries a load of 60 kN at a distance of 200 mm from the centre of the column. If the maximum
shear stress in the rivet is limited to 150 MPa, determine the diameter of the rivet.

Fig. 9.32
Solution. Given : n = 6 ; P = 60 kN = 60 × 103 N ; e = 200 mm ; τ = 150 MPa = 150 N/mm2
Since the rivets are of equal size and placed symmetrically, therefore the centre of gravity of the
rivet system lies at G as shown in Fig. 9.32. We know that ditect shear load on each rivet,

and resultant shear load on rivet 2,
R2 = Ps + F2 = 10 000 + 16 008 = 26 008 N
From above we see that the maximum resultant shear load is on rivets 1 and 3. If d is the
diameter of rivet hole, then maximum resultant shear load (R1 or R3),
35 384 = 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 4
π  × d 2 × 150 = 117.8 d 2
∴
d 2 = 35 384 / 117.8 = 300.4    or   d = 17.33 mm
From Table 9.7, we see that according to IS : 1929 – 1982 (Reaffirmed 1996), the standard
diameter of the rivet hole ( d ) is 19.5 mm and the corresponding diameter of the rivet is 18 mm.   Ans.
Example 9.18.  A bracket in the form of a plate is fitted to a column by means of four rivets A,
B, C and D in the same vertical line, as shown in Fig. 9.33. AB = BC = CD = 60 mm. E is the
mid-point of BC. A load of 100 kN is applied to the bracket at a point F which is at a horizontal
distance of 150 m from E. The load acts at an angle of 30° to the horizontal. Determine the diameter
of the rivets which are made of steel having a yield stress in shear of 240 MPa. Take a factor of safety
of 1.5.
What would be the thickness of the plate taking an allowable bending stress of 125 MPa for the
plate, assuming its total width at section ABCD as 240 mm?
Solution. Given : n = 4 ; AB = BC = CD = 60 mm ; P = 100 kN = 100 × 103 N; EF = 150 mm;
θ = 30° ; τy = 240 MPa = 240 N/mm2 ; F.S. = 1.5 ; σb = 125 MPa = 125 N/mm2 ; b = 240 mm

The direct shear load on each rivet acts in the direction of 100 kN load (i.e. at 30° to the
horizontal) as shown in Fig. 9.34. The centre of gravity of the rivet group lies at E. From Fig. 9.34, we
find that the perpendicular distance from the centre of gravity E to the line of action of the load (or
eccentricity of the load) is
EG = e = EF sin 30° = 150 × 1
2  = 75 mm
∴  Turning moment produced by the load P due to eccentricity
= P.e = 100 × 103 × 75 = 7500 × 103 N-mm
This turning moment is resisted by four bolts, as shown in Fig. 9.34. Let FA, FB, FC and FD be
the secondary shear load on the rivets, A, B, C, and D placed at distances lA, lB, lC and lD respectively
from the centre of gravity of the rivet system.
From Fig. 9.34, we find that

Example 9.3.  A double riveted double cover butt joint in plates 20 mm thick is made with
25 mm diameter rivets at 100 mm pitch. The permissible stresses are :
       σt = 120 MPa;
τ = 100 MPa;          σc = 150 MPa
Find the efficiency of joint, taking the strength of the rivet in double shear as twice than that of
single shear.
Solution. Given : t = 20 mm ; d = 25 mm ; p = 100 mm ; σt = 120 MPa = 120 N/mm2 ;
τ = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2 ; σc = 150 MPa = 150 N/mm2
First of all, let us find the tearing resistance of the plate, shearing resistance and crushing
resistance of the rivet.
(i)  Tearing resistance of the plate
We know that tearing resistance of the plate per pitch length,
Pt = (p – d) t × σt = (100 × 25) 20 × 120 = 180 000 N
(ii)  Shearing resistance of the rivets
Since the joint is double riveted butt joint, therefore the strength of two rivets in double shear is
taken. We know that shearing resistance of the rivets,
                                            Ps = n × 2 × 4
π  × d 2 × τ = 2 × 2 × 4
π  (25)2 100 = 196 375 N
(iii)  Crushing resistance of the rivets
Since the joint is double riveted, therefore the strength of two rivets is taken. We know that
crushing resistance of the rivets,
                   Pc = n × d × t × σc = 2 × 25 × 20 × 150 = 150 000 N
∴  Strength of the joint
                         =  Least of Pt, Ps and  Pc
                                  = 150 000 N
Efficiency of the joint
We know that the strength of the unriveted or solid plate,
                      P = p × t × σt = 100 × 20 × 120
                         = 240 000 N
∴            Efficiency of the joint

9.15 Design of Boiler Joints

Welded Joints     341
10.1 Introduction
A welded joint is a permanent joint which is obtained
by the fusion of the edges of the two parts to be joined
together, with or without the application of pressure and a
filler material. The heat required for the fusion of the
material may be obtained by burning of gas (in case of gas
welding) or by an electric arc (in case of electric arc
welding). The latter method is extensively used because of
greater speed of welding.
Welding is extensively used in fabrication as an
alternative method for casting or forging and as a
replacement for bolted and riveted joints. It is also used as
a repair medium e.g. to reunite metal at a crack, to build up
a small part that has broken off such as gear tooth or to
repair a worn surface such as a bearing surface.

10.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Welded Joints over Riveted Joints
Following are the advantages and disadvantages of welded joints over riveted joints.
Advantages
1.
The welded structures are usually lighter than riveted structures. This is due to the reason,
that in welding, gussets or other connecting components are not used.
2.
The welded joints provide maximum efficiency (may be 100%) which is not possible in
case of riveted joints.
3.
Alterations and additions can be easily made in the existing structures.
4.
As the welded structure is smooth in appearance, therefore it looks pleasing.
5.
In welded connections, the tension members are not weakened as in the case of riveted joints.
6.
A welded joint has a great strength. Often a welded joint has the strength of the parent
metal itself.
7.
Sometimes, the members are of such a shape (i.e. circular steel pipes) that they afford
difficulty for riveting. But they can be easily welded.
8.
The welding provides very rigid joints. This is in line with the modern trend of providing
rigid frames.
9.
It is possible to weld any part of a structure at any point. But riveting requires enough
clearance.
10.
The process of welding takes less time than the riveting.
Disadvantages
1.
Since there is an uneven heating and cooling during fabrication, therefore the members
may get distorted or additional stresses may develop.
2.
It requires a highly skilled labour and supervision.
3.
Since no provision is kept for expansion and contraction in the frame, therefore there is a
possibility of cracks developing in it.
4.
The inspection of welding work is more difficult than riveting work.
10.3 Welding Processes
The welding processes may be broadly classified into the following two groups:
1.
Welding processes that use heat
alone e.g. fusion welding.
2.
Welding processes that use a
combination of heat and pressure
e.g. forge welding.
These processes are discussed in
detail, in the following pages.
10.4 Fusion Welding
In case of fusion welding, the parts to
be jointed are held in position while the
molten metal is supplied to the joint. The
molten metal may come from the parts
themselves (i.e. parent metal) or filler metal
which normally have the composition of the
parent metal. The joint surface become
plastic or even molten because of the heat
Fusion welding at 245°C produces permanent
molecular bonds between sections.
Contents
Welded Joints     343
from the molten filler metal or other source. Thus, when the molten metal solidifies or fuses, the joint
is formed.
The fusion welding, according to the method of heat generated, may be classified as:
1.
Thermit welding,
2.
Gas welding, and
3. Electric arc welding.
10.5 Thermit Welding
In thermit welding, a mixture of iron oxide and aluminium called thermit is ignited and the iron
oxide is reduced to molten iron. The molten iron is poured into a mould made around the joint and
fuses with the parts to be welded. A major advantage of the thermit welding is that all parts of weld
section are molten at the same time and the weld cools almost uniformly. This results in a minimum
problem with residual stresses. It is fundamentally a melting and casting process.
The thermit welding is often used in joining iron and steel parts that are too large to be manufac-
tured in one piece, such as rails, truck frames, locomotive frames, other large sections used on steam
and rail roads, for stern frames, rudder frames etc. In steel mills, thermit electric welding is employed
to replace broken gear teeth, to weld new necks on rolls and pinions, and to repair broken shears.
10.6 Gas Welding
A gas welding is made by applying the flame of an oxy-acetylene or hydrogen gas from a
welding torch upon the surfaces of the prepared joint. The intense heat at the white cone of the flame
heats up the local surfaces to fusion point while the operator manipulates a welding rod to supply the
metal for the weld. A flux is being used to remove the slag. Since the heating rate in gas welding is
slow, therefore it can be used on thinner materials.
10.7 Electric Arc Welding
In electric arc welding, the work is prepared in the same manner as for gas welding. In this case
the filler metal is supplied by metal welding electrode. The operator, with his eyes and face protected,
strikes an arc by touching the work of base metal with the electrode. The base metal in the path of the
arc stream is melted, forming a pool of molten metal, which seems to be forced out of the pool by the
blast from the arc, as shown in Fig. 10.1. A small
depression is formed in the base metal and the
molten metal is deposited around the edge of this
depression, which is called the arc crater. The slag
is brushed off after the joint has cooled.
The arc welding does not require the metal
to be preheated and since the temperature of the
arc is quite high, therefore the fusion of the metal
is almost instantaneous. There are two kinds of
arc weldings depending upon the type of electrode.
1.  Un-shielded arc welding,
and
2.  Shielded arc welding.
When a large electrode or filler rod is used for welding, it is then said to be un-shielded arc welding.
In this case, the deposited weld metal while it is hot will absorb oxygen and nitrogen from the atmosphere.
This decreases the strength of weld metal and lower its ductility and resistance to corrosion.
In shielded arc welding, the welding rods coated with solid material are used, as shown in Fig.
10.1. The resulting projection of coating focuses a concentrated arc stream, which protects the globules
of metal from the air and prevents the absorption of large amounts of harmful oxygen and nitrogen.
10.8 Forge Welding
In forge welding, the parts to be jointed are first heated to a proper temperature in a furnace or

forge and then hammered. This method of welding
is rarely used now-a-days. An electric-resistance
welding is an example of forge welding.
In this case, the parts to be joined are pressed
together and an electric current is passed from one
part to the other until the metal is heated to the
fusion temperature of the joint. The principle of
applying heat and pressure, either sequentially or
simultaneously, is widely used in the processes
known as *spot, seam, projection, upset and flash
welding.
10.9 Types of Welded Joints
Following two types of welded joints are
important from the subject point of view:
1.
Lap joint or fillet joint,
    and
2. Butt joint.
( ) Single transverse.
a
( ) Double transverse.
b
( ) Parallel fillet.
c
Fig. 10.2. Types of lap or fillet joints.
10.10  Lap Joint
The lap joint or the fillet joint is obtained by overlapping the plates and then welding the edges
of the plates. The cross-section of the fillet is approximately triangular. The fillet joints may be
1.
Single transverse fillet,
2. Double transverse fillet,  and
3. Parallel fillet joints.
The fillet joints are shown in Fig. 10.2. A single transverse fillet joint has the disadvantage that
the edge of the plate which is not welded can buckle or warp out of shape.
10.11  Butt Joint
The butt joint is obtained by placing the plates edge to edge as shown in Fig. 10.3. In butt welds,
the plate edges do not require bevelling if the thickness of plate is less than 5 mm. On the other hand, if
the plate thickness is 5 mm to 12.5 mm, the edges should be bevelled to V or U-groove on both sides.

10.16  Strength of Transverse Fillet Welded Joints
We have already discussed that the fillet or lap joint is obtained by overlapping the plates and
then welding the edges of the plates. The transverse fillet welds are designed for tensile strength. Let
us consider a single and double transverse fillet welds as shown in Fig. 10.6 (a) and (b) respectively.
Fig. 10.6. Transverse fillet welds.
In order to determine the strength of the fillet joint, it is assumed that the section of fillet is a
right angled triangle ABC with hypotenuse AC making equal angles with other two sides AB and BC.
The enlarged view of the fillet is shown in Fig. 10.7. The length of each side is known as leg or size
of the weld and the perpendicular distance of the hypotenuse from the intersection of legs (i.e. BD) is
known as throat thickness. The minimum area of the weld is obtained at the throat BD, which is given
by the product of the throat thickness and length of weld.
Let
 t = Throat thickness (BD),
 s = Leg or size of weld,
= Thickness of plate, and
l = Length of weld,
From Fig. 10.7, we find that the throat thickness,
t = s × sin 45° = 0.707 s
∴  *Minimum area of the weld or throat area,
                              A =  Throat thickness ×
                                      Length of weld
                                 =   t × l = 0.707 s × l
If σt is the allowable tensile stress for the weld
metal, then the tensile strength of the joint for single fillet weld,
                              P = Throat area × Allowable tensile stress = 0.707 s × l × σt
and tensile strength of the joint for double fillet weld,
                            P = 2 × 0.707 s × l × σt = 1.414 s × l × σt
Note: Since the weld is weaker than the plate due to slag and blow holes, therefore the weld is given a reinforcement
which may be taken as 10% of the plate thickness.
10.17   Strength of Parallel Fillet Welded Joints
The parallel fillet welded joints are designed for shear strength. Consider a double parallel fillet
welded joint as shown in Fig. 10.8 (a). We have already discussed in the previous article, that the
minimum area of weld or the throat area,
                             A = 0.707 s × l

If τ is the allowable shear stress for the weld metal, then the shear strength of the joint for single
parallel fillet weld,
P = Throat area × Allowable shear stress = 0.707 s × l × τ
and shear strength of the joint for double parallel fillet weld,
P = 2 × 0.707 × s × l × τ = 1.414 s × l × τ

Notes: 1. If there is a combination of single transverse and double parallel fillet welds as shown in Fig. 10.8 (b),
then the strength of the joint is given by the sum of strengths of single transverse and double parallel fillet welds.
Mathematically,
P = 0.707s × l1 × σt + 1.414 s × l2 × τ
where l1 is normally the width of the plate.
2. In order to allow for starting and stopping of the
bead, 12.5 mm should be added to the length of each weld
obtained by the above expression.
3. For reinforced fillet welds, the throat dimension
may be taken as 0.85 t.
Example 10.1. A plate 100 mm wide and
10 mm thick is to be welded to another plate by means
of double parallel fillets. The plates are subjected to
a static load of 80 kN. Find the length of weld if the
permissible shear stress in the weld does not exceed
55 MPa.
Solution. Given: *Width = 100 mm ;
Thickness = 10 mm ; P = 80 kN = 80 × 103 N ;
τ = 55 MPa = 55 N/mm2
Let  l =Length of weld, and
s = Size of weld = Plate thickness = 10 mm
         ... (Given)
We know that maximum load which the plates can carry for double parallel fillet weld (P),
80 × 103 = 1.414 × s × l × τ = 1.414 × 10 × l × 55 = 778 l
∴
l = 80 × 103 / 778 = 103 mm
Adding 12.5 mm for starting and stopping of weld run, we have
l = 103 + 12.5 = 115.5 mm  Ans.

It may be noted that the effect of the applied torque is
to rotate the vertical plate about the Z-axis through its mid
point. This rotation is resisted by shearing stresses developed between two fillet welds and the horizontal
plate. It is assumed that these horizontal shearing stresses vary from zero at the Z-axis and maximum
at the ends of the plate. This variation of shearing stress is analogous to the variation of normal stress
over the depth (l) of a beam subjected to pure bending.

10.19 Strength of Butt Joints
The butt joints are designed for tension or compression. Consider a single V-butt joint as shown
in Fig. 10.14 (a).
Fig. 10.14. Butt joints.
In case of butt joint, the length of leg or size of weld is equal to the throat thickness which is
equal to thickness of plates.
∴ Tensile strength of the butt joint (single-V or square butt joint),
P = t × l × σt
where
l = Length of weld. It is generally equal to the width of plate.
and tensile strength for double-V butt joint as shown in Fig. 10.14 (b) is given by
P = (t1 + t2) l × σt
where
t1 = Throat thickness at the top, and
t2 = Throat thickness at the bottom.
It may be noted that size of the weld should be greater than the thickness of the plate, but it may
be less. The following table shows recommended minimum size of the welds.

10.20 Stresses for Welded Joints
The stresses in welded joints are difficult to determine because of the variable and unpredictable
parameters like homogenuity of the weld metal, thermal stresses in the welds, changes of physical
properties due to high rate of cooling etc. The stresses are obtained, on the following assumptions:
1.
The load is distributed uniformly along the entire length of the weld, and
2.
The stress is spread uniformly over its effective section.
The following table shows the stresses for welded joints for joining ferrous metals with mild
steel electrode under steady and fatigue or reversed load.

10.21  Stress Concentration Factor for Welded Joints
The reinforcement provided to the weld produces stress concentration at the junction of the
weld and the parent metal. When the parts are subjected to fatigue loading, the stress concentration
factor as given in the following table should be taken into account.

means of parallel fillet welds. The plates are subjected to a load of 50 kN. Find the length of the weld

then under fatigue loading.
Contents
Welded Joints     355
Solution. Given: *Width = 100 mm ; Thickness = 12.5 mm ; P = 50 kN = 50 × 103N ;
τ = 56 MPa = 56 N/mm2
Length of weld for static loading
Let       l = Length of weld, and
           s = Size of weld = Plate thickness
              = 12.5 mm
... (Given)
We know that the maximum load which the
plates can carry for double parallel fillet welds (P),
50 × 103 =1.414 s × l × τ
               = 1.414 × 12.5 × l × 56 = 990 l
∴         l = 50 × 103 / 990 = 50.5 mm
Adding 12.5 mm for starting and stopping of
weld run, we have
             l = 50.5 + 12.5 = 63 mm  Ans.
Length of weld for fatigue loading
From Table 10.6, we find that the stress
concentration factor for parallel fillet welding is 2.7.
∴Permissible shear stress,
                               τ =  56 / 2.7 = 20.74 N/mm2
We know that the maximum load which the plates can carry for double parallel fillet welds (P),
                   50 × 103 = 1.414 s × l × τ = 1.414 × 12.5 × l × 20.74 = 367 l
∴                            l =  50 × 103 / 367 = 136.2 mm
Adding 12.5 for starting and stopping of weld run, we have
                               l = 136.2 + 12.5 = 148.7 mm  Ans.
Example 10.5. A plate 75 mm wide and 12.5 mm thick is joined with another plate by a single
transverse weld and a double parallel fillet weld as shown in Fig.
10.15. The maximum tensile and shear stresses are 70 MPa and
56 MPa respectively.
Find the length of each parallel fillet weld, if the joint is
subjected to both static and fatigue loading.
Solution. Given : Width = 75 mm ; Thickness = 12.5 mm ;
στ = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2 ; τ = 56 MPa = 56 N/mm2.
The effective length of weld (l1) for the transverse weld may be
obtained by subtracting 12.5 mm from the width of the plate.
∴
l1 = 75 – 12.5 = 62.5 mm
Length of each parallel fillet for static loading
Let
 l2 = Length of each parallel fillet.
We know that the maximum load which the plate can carry is
P = Area × Stress = 75 × 12.5 × 70 = 65 625 N
Load carried by single transverse weld,
P1 = 0.707 s × l1 × σt = 0.707 × 12.5 × 62.5 × 70 = 38 664 N
and the load carried by double parallel fillet weld,
P2 = 1.414 s × l2 × τ = 1.414 × 12.5 × l2 × 56 = 990 l2 N

                  65 625 = P1 + P2 = 38 664 + 990 l2   or   l2 = 27.2 mm
Adding 12.5 mm for starting and stopping of weld run, we have
                           l2 = 27.2 + 12.5 = 39.7 say 40 mm Ans.
Length of each parallel fillet for fatigue loading
From Table 10.6, we find that the stress concentration factor for transverse welds is 1.5 and for
parallel fillet welds is 2.7.
∴Permissible tensile stress,
σt = 70 / 1.5  = 46.7 N/mm2
and permissible shear stress,
τ = 56 / 2.7 = 20.74 N/mm2
Load carried by single transverse weld,
P1 = 0.707 s × l1 × σt = 0.707 × 12.5 × 62.5 × 46.7 = 25 795 N
and load carried by double parallel fillet weld,
P2 = 1.414 s × l2 × τ = 1.414 × 12.5 l2 × 20.74 = 366 l2 N
∴Load carried by the joint (P),
65 625 = P1 + P2 = 25 795 + 366 l2    or    l2 = 108.8 mm
Adding 12.5 mm for starting and stopping of weld run, we have
l2 = 108.8 + 12.5 = 121.3 mm Ans.
Example 10.6. Determine the length of the weld run for a plate of size 120 mm wide and 15 mm
thick to be welded to another plate by means of
1. A single transverse weld; and
2. Double parallel fillet welds when the joint is subjected to
variable loads.
Solution. Given : Width = 120 mm ; Thickness = 15 mm
In Fig. 10.16, AB represents the single transverse weld and AC
and BD represents double parallel fillet welds.
1.  Length of the weld run for a single transverse weld
The effective length of the weld run (l1) for a single transverse weld may be obtained by subtracting
12.5 mm from the width of the plate.
∴
l1 = 120 – 12.5 = 107.5 mm  Ans.
2.  Length of the weld run for a double parallel fillet weld subjected to variable loads
Let
 l2 = Length of weld run for each parallel fillet, and
s = Size of weld = Thickness of plate = 15 mm
Assuming the tensile stress as 70 MPa or N/mm2 and shear stress as 56 MPa or N/mm2 for static
loading. We know that the maximum load which the plate can carry is
P = Area × Stress = 120 × 15 × 70 = 126 × 103 N
From Table 10.6, we find that the stress concentration factor for transverse weld is 1.5 and for
parallel fillet welds is 2.7.

∴Load carried by single transverse weld,
                             P1  = 0.707 s × l1 × σt = 0.707 × 15 × 107.5 × 46.7 = 53 240 N

∴Load carried by the joint (P),
126 × 103 = P1 + P2 = 53 240 + 440 l2   or   l2 = 165.4 mm
Adding 12.5 mm for starting and stopping of weld run, we have
l2 = 165.4 + 12.5 = 177.9 say 178 mm

Example 10.7. The fillet welds of equal legs are used to fabricate a `T' as shown in Fig. 10.17
(a) and (b), where s is the leg size and l is the length of weld.

Locate the plane of maximum shear stress in each of the following loading patterns:
1. Load parallel to the weld (neglect eccentricity), and
2. Load at right angles to the weld (transverse load).
Find the ratio of these limiting loads.
Solution. Given : Leg size = s ; Length of weld = l
1. Plane of maximum shear stress when load acts parallel to the weld (neglecting eccentricity)
Let
 θ = Angle of plane of maximum shear stress, and

10.22  Axially Loaded Unsymmetrical Welded
Sections
Sometimes unsymmetrical sections such as angles,
channels, T-sections etc., welded on the flange edges are loaded
axially as shown in Fig. 10.20. In such cases, the lengths of weld
should be proportioned in such a way that the sum of resisting
moments of the welds about the gravity axis is zero. Consider an
angle section as shown in Fig. 10.20.

P = Axial load,
a = Distance of top weld from gravity axis,
b = Distance of bottom weld from gravity axis, and
f = Resistance offered by the weld per unit length.
Fig. 10.20. Axially loaded unsymmetrical welded section.
∴  Moment of the top weld about gravity axis
= la × f × a
and moment of the bottom weld about gravity axis
= lb × f × b
Since the sum of the moments of the weld about the gravity axis must be zero, therefore,
la × f × a – lb × f × b = 0
or

Example 10.8. A 200 × 150 × 10 mm angle is to be welded to a steel plate by fillet welds as
shown in Fig. 10.21. If the angle is subjected to a static load of 200 kN, find the length of weld at the
top and bottom. The allowable shear stress for static loading may be taken as 75 MPa.
Fig. 10.21
Solution. Given :
a + b = 200 mm ; P = 200 kN = 200 × 103 N ; τ = 75 MPa = 75 N/mm2
Let
 la = Length of weld at the top,
lb = Length of weld at the bottom, and

Welded Joints     361
Since the thickness of the angle is 10 mm, therefore size of weld,
s = 10 mm
We know that for a single parallel fillet weld, the maximum load (P),
200 × 103 = 0.707 s × l × τ = 0.707 × 10 × l × 75 = 530.25 l
∴
l = 200 × 103 / 530.25 = 377 mm

10.23  Eccentrically Loaded Welded Joints
An eccentric load may be imposed on welded joints in many ways. The stresses induced on the
joint may be of different nature or of the same nature. The induced stresses are combined depending
upon the nature of stresses. When the shear and bending stresses are simultaneously present in a joint
(see case 1), then maximum stresses are as follows:

where

When the stresses are of the same nature, these may be combined

We shall now discuss the two cases of eccentric loading as follows:
Case 1
Consider a T-joint fixed at one end and subjected to an eccentric load P at a distance e as shown
in Fig. 10.22.
Let
    s = Size of weld,
l = Length of weld, and
t = Throat thickness.
The joint will be subjected to the following two types of stresses:
1.
Direct shear stress due to the shear force P acting at the welds, and
2.
Bending stress due to the bending moment P × e.
We know that area at the throat,
A = Throat thickness × Length of weld
= t × l × 2 = 2 t × l
... (For double fillet weld)
= 2 × 0.707 s × l = 1.414 s × l

Case 2
When a welded joint is loaded eccentrically as shown in Fig. 10.23,
the following two types of the stresses are induced:
1.
Direct or primary shear stress, and
2.
Shear stress due to turning moment.
Fig. 10.23. Eccentrically loaded welded joint.
Let
 P = Eccentric load,
e = Eccentricity i.e. perpendicular distance between the line of action of
 load and centre of gravity (G) of the throat section or fillets,
l =  Length of single weld,
s =  Size or leg of weld, and
t =  Throat thickness.
Let two loads P1 and P2 (each equal to P) are introduced at the centre of gravity ‘G' of the weld
system. The effect of load P1 = P is to produce direct shear stress which is assumed to be uniform over
the entire weld length. The effect of load P2 = P is to produce a turning moment of magnitude P × e
which tends of rotate the joint about the centre of gravity ‘G' of the weld system. Due to the turning
moment, secondary shear stress is induced.
Soldering is done
by melting a metal
which melts at a
lower temperature
than the metal that
is soldered.

Note: In the above expressions, t is the throat thickness and s is the size of weld. It has already been discussed
that t = 0.707 s.
Example 10.9. A welded joint as shown in Fig. 10.24, is subjected to an eccentric load of 2 kN.
Find the size of weld, if the maximum shear stress in the weld
is 25 MPa.
Solution. Given: P = 2kN = 2000 N ; e = 120 mm ;
l = 40 mm ; τmax = 25 MPa = 25 N/mm2
Let
 s = Size of weld in mm, and
t = Throat thickness.
The joint, as shown in Fig. 10.24, will be subjected to
direct shear stress due to the shear force, P = 2000 N and
bending stress due to the bending moment of P × e.
We know that area at the throat,
A = 2t × l = 2 × 0.707 s × l
= 1.414 s × l
= 1.414 s × 40 = 56.56 × s mm2

Example 10.10. A 50 mm diameter solid shaft is welded to a flat plate as shown in Fig. 10.25.

Solution. Given : D = 50 mm ; s = 15 mm ; P = 10 kN
= 10 000 N ; e = 200 mm
Let
 t = Throat thickness.
The joint, as shown in Fig. 10.25, is subjected to direct
shear stress and the bending stress. We know that the throat area
for a circular fillet weld,
A = t × π D = 0.707 s × π D

Let

The joint, as shown in Fig. 10.26, is subjected to direct shear stress and the bending stress. We
know that the throat area for a rectangular fillet weld,
A = t (2b + 2l) = 0.707 s (2b + 2l)

Example 10.13. A bracket carrying a load of 15 kN is to be welded as shown in Fig. 10.28.
Find the size of weld required if the allowable shear stress is not to exceed 80 MPa.

Screwed Joints     377
11.1 Introduction
A screw thread is formed by cutting a continuous
helical groove on a cylindrical surface. A screw made by
cutting a single helical groove on the cylinder is known as
single threaded (or single-start) screw and if a second thread
is cut in the space between the grooves of the first, a double
threaded (or double-start) screw is formed. Similarly, triple
and quadruple (i.e. multiple-start) threads may be formed.
The helical grooves may be cut either right hand or left
hand.
A screwed joint is mainly composed of two elements
i.e. a bolt and nut. The screwed joints are widely used where
the machine parts are required to be readily connected or
disconnected without damage to the machine or the fasten-
ing. This may be for the purpose of holding or adjustment
in assembly or service inspection, repair, or replacement
or it may be for the manufacturing or assembly reasons.

11.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Screwed Joints
Following are the advantages and disadvantages of the
screwed joints.
Advantages
1.
Screwed joints are highly reliable in operation.
2.
Screwed joints are convenient to assemble and
disassemble.
3.
A wide range of screwed joints may be adopted to
various operating conditions.
4.
Screws are relatively cheap to produce due to
standardisation and highly efficient manufacturing
processes.
Disadvantages
The main disadvantage of the screwed joints is the stress
concentration in the threaded portions which are vulnerable points under variable load conditions.
Note : The strength of the screwed joints is not comparable with that of riveted or welded joints.
11.3 Important Terms Used in Screw Threads
The following terms used in screw threads, as shown in Fig. 11.1, are important from the subject
point of view :
Fig. 11.1. Terms used in screw threads.
1. Major diameter. It is the largest diameter of an external or internal screw thread. The
screw is specified by this diameter. It is also known as outside or nominal diameter.
2. Minor diameter. It is the smallest diameter of an external or internal screw thread. It is
also known as core or root diameter.
3. Pitch diameter. It is the diameter of an imaginary cylinder, on a cylindrical screw thread,
the surface of which would pass through the thread at such points as to make equal the width of the
thread and the width of the spaces between the threads. It is also called an effective diameter. In a nut
and bolt assembly, it is the diameter at which the ridges on the bolt are in complete touch with the
ridges of the corresponding nut.

Screwed Joints     379
4.  Pitch. It is the distance from a point on one thread to the corresponding point on the next.
This is measured in an axial direction between corresponding points in the same axial plane.
Mathematically,
Pitch
= 
1
No. of threads per unit length of screw
5.  Lead. It is the distance between two corresponding points on the same helix. It may also
be defined as the distance which a screw thread advances axially in one rotation of the nut. Lead is
equal to the pitch in case of single start threads, it is twice the pitch in double start, thrice the pitch in
triple start and so on.
6.  Crest. It is the top surface of the thread.
7.  Root. It is the bottom surface created by the two adjacent flanks of the thread.
8.  Depth of thread. It is the perpendicular distance between the crest and root.
9.  Flank. It is the surface joining the crest and root.
10.  Angle of thread. It is the angle included by the flanks of the thread.
11. Slope. It is half the pitch of the thread.
11.4 Forms of Screw Threads
The following are the various forms of screw threads.
1. British standard whitworth (B.S.W.) thread. This is a British standard thread profile and
has coarse pitches. It is a symmetrical V-thread in which the angle between the flankes, measured in
an axial plane, is 55°. These threads are found on bolts and screwed fastenings for special purposes.
The various proportions of B.S.W. threads are shown in Fig. 11.2.
Fig. 11.2. British standard whitworth (B.S.W) thread.
Fig. 11.3. British association (B.A.) thread.
The British standard threads with fine pitches (B.S.F.) are used where great strength at the root
is required. These threads are also used for line adjustments and where the connected parts are
subjected to increased vibrations as in aero and automobile work.
The British standard pipe (B.S.P.) threads with fine pitches are used for steel and iron pipes and
tubes carrying fluids. In external pipe threading, the threads are specified by the bore of the pipe.
2. British association (B.A.) thread. This is a B.S.W. thread with fine pitches. The proportions
of the B.A. thread are shown in Fig. 11.3. These threads are used for instruments and other precision
works.
3. American national standard thread. The American national standard or U.S. or Seller's
thread has flat crests and roots. The flat crest can withstand more rough usage than sharp V-threads.
These threads are used for general purposes e.g. on bolts, nuts, screws and tapped holes. The various

proportions are shown in Fig. 11.4.
Fig. 11.4. American national standard thread.
Fig. 11.5. Unified standard thread.
4. Unified standard thread. The three countries i.e., Great Britain, Canada and United States
came to an agreement for a common screw thread system with the included angle of 60°, in order to
facilitate the exchange of machinery. The thread has rounded crests and roots, as shown in Fig. 11.5.
5. Square thread. The square threads, because of their high efficiency, are widely used for
transmission of power in either direction. Such type of threads are usually found on the feed
mechanisms of machine tools, valves, spindles, screw jacks etc. The square threads are not so strong
as V-threads but they offer less frictional resistance to motion than Whitworth threads. The pitch of
the square thread is often taken twice that of a B.S.W. thread of the same diameter. The proportions of
the thread are shown in Fig. 11.6.
Fig. 11.6. Square thread.
Fig. 11.7. Acme thread.
6. Acme thread. It is a modification of square thread. It is much stronger than square thread
and can be easily produced. These threads are frequently used on screw cutting lathes, brass valves,
cocks and bench vices. When used in conjunction with a split nut, as on the lead screw of a lathe, the
tapered sides of the thread facilitate ready engagement and disengagement of the halves of the nut
when required. The various proportions are shown in Fig. 11.7.

7. Knuckle thread. It is also a modification of
square thread. It has rounded top and bottom. It can
be cast or rolled easily and can not economically be
made on a machine. These threads are used for rough
and ready work. They are usually found on railway
carriage couplings, hydrants, necks of glass bottles
and large moulded insulators used in electrical trade.
8. Buttress thread. It is used for transmission
of power in one direction only. The force is
transmitted almost parallel to the axis. This thread
units the advantage of both square and V-threads. It
has a low frictional resistance characteristics of the square thread and have the same strength as that
of V-thread. The spindles of bench vices are usually provided with buttress thread. The various
proportions of buttress thread are shown in Fig. 11.9.
Fig. 11.9. Buttress thread.
9. Metric thread. It is an Indian standard thread and is similar to B.S.W. threads. It has an
included angle of 60° instead of 55°. The basic profile of the thread is shown in Fig. 11.10 and the
design profile of the nut and bolt is shown in Fig. 11.11.

11.5 Location of Screwed Joints
The choice of type of fastenings and its
location are very important. The fastenings
should be located in such a way so that they will
be subjected to tensile and/or shear loads and
bending of the fastening should be reduced to a
minimum. The bending of the fastening due to
misalignment, tightening up loads, or external
loads are responsible for many failures. In order
to relieve fastenings of bending stresses, the use
of clearance spaces, spherical seat washers, or
other devices may be used.

11.6 Common Types of Screw Fastenings
Following are the common types of screw fastenings :
1. Through bolts. A through bolt (or simply a bolt) is shown in Fig. 11.12 (a). It is a cylindrical
bar with threads for the nut at one end and head at the other end. The cylindrical part of the bolt is
known as shank. It is passed through drilled holes in the two parts to be fastened together and clamped
them securely to each other as the nut is screwed on to the threaded end. The through bolts may or
may not have a machined finish and are made with either hexagonal or square heads. A through bolt
should pass easily in the holes, when put under tension by a load along its axis. If the load acts
perpendicular to the axis, tending to slide one of the connected parts along the other end thus subject-
ing it to shear, the holes should be reamed so that the bolt shank fits snugly there in. The through bolts
according to their usage may be known as machine bolts, carriage bolts, automobile bolts, eye bolts
etc.
Fig. 11.12
2. Tap bolts. A tap bolt or screw differs from a bolt. It is screwed into a tapped hole of one of
the parts to be fastened without the nut, as shown in Fig. 11.12 (b).
3. Studs. A stud is a round bar threaded at both ends. One end of the stud is screwed into a
tapped hole of the parts to be fastened, while the other end receives a nut on it, as shown in Fig. 11.12
(c). Studs are chiefly used instead of tap bolts for securing various kinds of covers e.g. covers of
engine and pump cylinders, valves, chests etc.
Deck-handler crane is used on ships to move loads
Note : This picture is given as additional information and is not a direct example of the current chapter.
Contents
Top
384    A Textbook of Machine Design
This is due to the fact that when tap bolts are unscrewed or replaced, they have a tendency to
break the threads in the hole. This disadvantage is overcome by the use of studs.
4. Cap screws. The cap screws are similar to tap bolts except that they are of small size and a
variety of shapes of heads are available as shown in Fig. 11.13.
Fig. 11.13. Types of cap screws.
5. Machine screws. These are similar to cap screws with the head slotted for a screw driver.
These are generally used with a nut.
6. Set screws. The set screws are shown in Fig. 11.14. These are used to prevent relative
motion between the two parts. A set screw is screwed through a threaded hole in one part so that its
point (i.e. end of the screw) presses against the other part. This resists the relative motion between the
two parts by means of friction between the point of the screw and one of the parts. They may be used
instead of key to prevent relative motion between a hub and a shaft in light power transmission
members. They may also be used in connection with a key, where they prevent relative axial motion
of the shaft, key and hub assembly.
Fig. 11.14. Set screws.
The diameter of the set screw (d) may be obtained from the following expression:
d = 0.125 D + 8 mm
where D is the diameter of the shaft (in mm) on which the set screw is pressed.
The tangential force (in newtons) at the surface of the shaft is given by

11.7 Locking Devices
Ordinary thread fastenings, generally, remain tight under static loads, but many of these
fastenings become loose under the action of variable loads or when machine is subjected to vibra-
tions. The loosening of fastening is very dangerous and must be prevented. In order to prevent this, a
large number of locking devices are available, some of which are discussed below :
1. Jam nut or lock nut. A most common locking device is a jam, lock or check nut. It has about
one-half to two-third thickness of the standard nut. The thin lock nut is first tightened down with
ordinary force, and then the upper nut (i.e. thicker nut) is tightened down upon it, as shown in Fig.
11.15 (a). The upper nut is then held tightly while the lower one is slackened back against it.
Fig. 11.15. Jam nut or lock nut.
In slackening back the lock nut, a thin spanner is required which is difficult to find in many
shops. Therefore to overcome this difficulty, a thin nut is placed on the top as shown in Fig. 11.15 (b).
If the nuts are really tightened down as they should be, the upper nut carries a greater tensile
load than the bottom one. Therefore, the top nut should be thicker one with a thin nut below it because
it is desirable to put whole of the load on the thin nut. In order to overcome both the difficulties, both
the nuts are made of the same thickness as shown in Fig. 11.15 (c).
2. Castle nut. It consists of a hexagonal portion with a cylindrical upper part which is slotted in
line with the centre of each face, as shown in Fig. 11.16. The split pin passes through two slots in the
nut and a hole in the bolt, so that a positive lock is obtained unless the pin shears. It is extensively used
on jobs subjected to sudden shocks and considerable vibration such as in automobile industry.
 3. Sawn nut. It has a slot sawed about half way through, as shown in Fig. 11.17. After the nut
is screwed down, the small screw is tightened which produces more friction between the nut and the
bolt. This prevents the loosening of nut.
4. Penn, ring or grooved nut. It has a upper portion hexagonal and a lower part cylindrical as
shown in Fig. 11.18. It is largely used where bolts pass through connected pieces reasonably near
their edges such as in marine type connecting rod ends. The bottom portion is cylindrical and is
recessed to receive the tip of the locking set screw. The bolt hole requires counter-boring to receive
the cylindrical portion of the nut. In order to prevent bruising of the latter by the case hardened tip of
the set screw, it is recessed.

5. Locking with pin. The nuts may be locked by means of a taper pin or cotter pin passing
through the middle of the nut as shown in Fig. 11.19 (a). But a split pin is often driven through the bolt
above the nut, as shown in Fig. 11.19 (b).
Fig. 11.19. Locking with pin.
6. Locking with plate. A form of stop plate or locking plate is shown in Fig. 11.20. The nut can
be adjusted and subsequently locked through angular intervals of 30° by using these plates.
Fig. 11.20. Locking with plate.
Fig. 11.21. Locking with washer.
7. Spring lock washer. A spring lock washer is shown in Fig. 11.21. As the nut tightens the
washer against the piece below, one edge of the washer is caused to dig itself into that piece, thus
increasing the resistance so that the nut will not loosen so easily. There are many kinds of spring lock
washers manufactured, some of which are fairly effective.

11.10 Stresses in Screwed Fastening due to Static Loading
The following stresses in screwed fastening due to static loading are important from the subject
point of view :
1.
Internal stresses due to screwing up forces,
2.
Stresses due to external forces, and
3.
Stress due to combination of stresses at (1) and (2).
We shall now discuss these stresses, in detail, in the following articles.
11.11 Initial Stresses due to Screwing up Forces
The following stresses are induced in a bolt, screw or stud when it is screwed up tightly.
1. Tensile stress due to stretching of bolt. Since none of the above mentioned stresses are
accurately determined, therefore bolts are designed on the basis of direct tensile stress with a large
factor of safety in order to account for the indeterminate stresses. The initial tension in a bolt, based
on experiments, may be found by the relation
Pi = 2840 d N
where
Pi = Initial tension in a bolt, and
d = Nominal diameter of bolt, in mm.
The above relation is used for making a joint fluid tight like steam engine cylinder cover joints
etc. When the joint is not required as tight as fluid-tight joint, then the initial tension in a bolt may be
reduced to half of the above value. In such cases
Pi = 1420 d N
The small diameter bolts may fail during tightening, therefore bolts of smaller diameter (less
than M 16 or M 18) are not permitted in making fluid tight joints.
If the bolt is not initially stressed, then the maximum safe axial load which may be applied to it,
is given by
P = Permissible stress × Cross-sectional area at bottom of the thread
(i.e. stress area)
The stress area may be obtained from Table 11.1 or it may be found by using the relation
Stress area =

where

T = Torque applied, and
dc = Minor or core diameter of the thread.
It has been shown during experiments that due to repeated unscrewing and tightening of the nut,
there is a gradual scoring of the threads, which increases the torsional twisting moment (T).
3. Shear stress across the threads. The average thread shearing stress for the screw (τs) is
obtained by using the relation :
τs =

the threads (σc) may be obtained by using the relation :

where
d = Major diameter,
dc = Minor diameter, and
n = Number of threads in engagement.
5. Bending stress if the surfaces under the head or nut are not perfectly parallel to the bolt
axis. When the outside surfaces of the parts to be connected are not parallel to each other, then the
bolt will be subjected to bending action. The bending stress (σb) induced in the shank of the bolt is
given by
σb =
.

where
x = Difference in height between the extreme corners of the nut or
head,
l = Length of the shank of the bolt, and
E = Young’s modulus for the material of the bolt.
Example 11.1. Determine the safe tensile load for a bolt of M 30, assuming a safe tensile stress
of 42 MPa.
Solution. Given : d = 30 mm ; σt = 42 MPa = 42 N/mm2

Screwed Joints     391
From Table 11.1 (coarse series), we find that the stress area i.e. cross-sectional area at the
bottom of the thread corresponding to M 30 is 561 mm2.
∴
Safe tensile load = Stress area × σt = 561 × 42 = 23 562 N = 23.562 kN   Ans.
Note: In the above example, we have assumed that the bolt is not initially stressed.
Example 11.2. Two machine parts are fastened together tightly by means of a 24 mm tap bolt.
If the load tending to separate these parts is neglected, find the stress that is set up in the bolt by the
initial tightening.
Solution. Given : d = 24 mm
From Table 11.1 (coarse series), we find that the core diameter of the thread corresponding to
M 24 is dc = 20.32 mm.
Let
σt = Stress set up in the bolt.
We know that initial tension in the bolt,
P = 2840 d = 2840 × 24 = 68 160 N
We also know that initial tension in the bolt (P),

11.12 Stresses due to External Forces
The following stresses are induced in a bolt when it is subjected to an external load.
1. Tensile stress. The bolts, studs and screws usually carry a load in the direction of the bolt
axis which induces a tensile stress in the bolt.
Let
dc = Root or core diameter of the thread, and
σt = Permissible tensile stress for the bolt material.
We know that external load applied,

2. Shear stress. Sometimes, the bolts are used to prevent the relative movement of two or more
parts, as in case of flange coupling, then the shear stress is induced in the bolts. The shear stresses
should be avoided as far as possible. It should be noted that when the bolts are subjected to direct
shearing loads, they should be located in such a way that the shearing load comes upon the body (i.e.
shank) of the bolt and not upon the threaded portion. In some cases, the bolts may be relieved of shear
load by using shear pins. When a number of bolts are used to share the shearing load, the finished
bolts should be fitted to the reamed holes.

n = Number of bolts.

3. Combined tension and shear stress. When the bolt is subjected to both tension and shear
loads, as in case of coupling bolts or bearing, then the diameter of the shank of the bolt is obtained
from the shear load and that of threaded part from the tensile load. A diameter slightly larger than that
required for either shear or tension may be assumed and stresses due to combined load should be
checked for the following principal stresses.

Example 11.3. An eye bolt is to be used
for lifting a load of 60 kN. Find the nominal di-
ameter of the bolt, if the tensile stress is not to
exceed 100 MPa. Assume coarse threads.
Solution. Given : P = 60 kN = 60 × 103 N ;
σt = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2
An eye bolt for lifting a load is shown in
Fig. 11.22.
Let
d = Nominal diameter of the
bolt, and
dc = Core diameter of the bolt.

Note : A lifting eye bolt, as shown in Fig. 11.22, is used for lifting and transporting heavy machines. It consists
of a ring of circular cross-section at the head and provided with threads at the lower portion for screwing inside
a threaded hole on the top of the machine.
Example 11.4. Two shafts are connected by means of a flange coupling to transmit torque
of 25 N-m. The flanges of the coupling are fastened by four bolts of the same material at a radius
of 30 mm. Find the size of the bolts if the allowable shear stress for the bolt material is 30 MPa.
Solution. Given : T = 25 N-m = 25 × 103 N-mm ; n = 4; Rp = 30 mm ; τ = 30 MPa = 30 N/mm2

Example 11.5. A lever loaded safety valve has a diameter of 100 mm and the blow off pressure
is 1.6 N/mm2. The fulcrum of the lever is screwed into the cast iron body of the cover. Find the
diameter of the threaded part of the fulcrum if the permissible tensile stress is limited to 50 MPa and
the leverage ratio is 8.
Solution. Given : D = 100 mm ; p = 1.6 N/mm2; σt = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2
We know that the load acting on the valve,

11.13 Stress due to Combined Forces
Fig. 11.23
The resultant axial load on a bolt depends upon the following factors :
1.
The initial tension due to tightening of the bolt,
2.
The extenal load, and
3.
The relative elastic yielding (springiness) of the bolt and the connected members.
When the connected members are very yielding as compared with the bolt, which is a soft
gasket, as shown in Fig. 11.23 (a), then the resultant load on the bolt is approximately equal to the
sum of the initial tension and the external load. On the other hand, if the bolt is very yielding as
compared with the connected members, as shown in Fig. 11.23 (b), then the resultant load will be
either the initial tension or the external load, whichever is greater. The actual conditions usually lie
between the two extremes. In order to determine the resultant axial load (P) on the bolt, the following
equation may be used :

equal to unity, so that the resultant load is equal to the sum of the initial tension and the external load.
For hard gaskets or metal to metal contact surfaces and with small bolts, the value of a is small
and the resultant load is mainly due to the initial tension (or external load, in rare case it is greater than
initial tension).
The value of ‘a’ may be estimated by the designer to obtain an approximate value for the

11.14 Design of Cylinder Covers
The cylinder covers may be secured by means of bolts or studs, but studs are preferred. The
possible arrangement of securing the cover with bolts and studs is shown in Fig. 11.24 (a) and (b)
respectively. The bolts or studs, cylinder cover plate and cylinder flange may be designed as
discussed below:
1. Design of bolts or studs
In order to find the size and number of bolts or studs, the following procedure may be adopted.
Let
D = Diameter of the cylinder,
p = Pressure in the cylinder,
dc = Core diameter of the bolts or studs,
n = Number of bolts or studs, and
σtb = Permissible tensile stress for the bolt or stud material.

above relation is odd or a fraction, then next higher even number is adopted.
The bolts or studs are screwed up tightly, along with metal gasket or asbestos packing, in order
to provide a leak proof joint. We have already discussed that due to the tightening of bolts, sufficient

tensile stress is produced in the bolts or studs. This may break the bolts or studs, even before any load
due to internal pressure acts upon them. Therefore a bolt or a stud less than 16 mm diameter should
never be used.
The tightness of the joint also depends upon the circumferential pitch of the bolts or studs. The
circumferential pitch should be between 20 
1
d  and 30 
1
d , where d1 is the diameter of the hole in
mm for bolt or stud. The pitch circle diameter (Dp) is usually taken as D + 2t + 3d1 and outside
diameter of the cover is kept as
Do = Dp + 3d1 = D + 2t + 6d1
where
t = Thickness of the cylinder wall.
2.  Design of cylinder cover plate
The thickness of the cylinder cover plate (t1) and
the thickness of the cylinder flange (t2) may be
determined as discussed below:
Let us consider the semi-cover plate as shown in
Fig. 11.25. The internal pressure in the cylinder tries to
lift the cylinder cover while the bolts or studs try to retain
it in its position. But the centres of pressure of these two
loads do not coincide. Hence, the cover plate is subjected
to bending stress. The point X is the centre of pressure
for bolt load and the point Y is the centre of internal
pressure.
We know that the bending moment at A-A,
M = Total bolt load (

value of t1 may be determined by using the bending equation,
i.e., σt = M / Z.
3.  Design of cylinder flange
The thickness of the cylinder flange (t2) may be determined
from bending consideration. A portion of the cylinder flange
under the influence of one bolt is shown in Fig. 11.26.
The load in the bolt produces bending stress in the section
X-X. From the geometry of the figure, we find that eccentricity
of the load from section X-X is

pressure vessel. The hole is 120 mm in diameter and the pressure inside the vessel is 6 N/mm2. Design

Example 11.8. The cylinder head of a steam engine is subjected to a steam pressure of
0.7 N/mm2. It is held in position by means of 12 bolts. A soft copper gasket is used to make the joint
leak-proof. The effective diameter of cylinder is 300 mm. Find the size of the bolts so that the stress
in the bolts is not to exceed 100 MPa.
Solution. Given: p = 0.7 N/mm2 ; n = 12 ; D = 300 mm ; σt = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2

1.5 N/mm2. The cylinder head is connected by 8 bolts having yield point 330 MPa and endurance
limit at 240 MPa. The bolts are tightened with an initial preload of 1.5 times the steam load. A soft
copper gasket is used to make the joint leak-proof. Assuming a factor of safety 2, find the size of bolt
required. The stiffness factor for copper gasket may be taken as 0.5.
Solution. Given : D = 300 mm ; p = 1.5 N/mm2 ; n = 8 ; σy = 330 MPa = 330 N/mm2;
σe = 240 MPa = 240 N/mm2 ; P1 = 1.5 P2 ; F.S. = 2 ; K = 0.5

1. Direct stays. These stays are usually screwed round bars placed at right angles to the plates
supported by them.
2. Diagonal and gusset stays. These stays are used for supporting one plate by trying it to
another at right angles to it.
3. Girder stays. These stays are placed edgewise on the plate to be supported and bolted to it at
intervals.
Fig. 11.28. Boiler stays.
Here we are mainly concerned with the direct stays. The direct stays may be bar stays or screwed
stays. A bar stay for supporting one end plate of a boiler shell from the other end plate is shown in Fig.
11.28 (a). The ends of the bar are screwed to receive two nuts between which the end plate is locked.
The bar stays are not screwed into the plates.
The fire boxes or combustion chambers of locomotive and marine boilers are supported by
screwed stays as shown in Fig. 11.28 (b). These stays are called screwed stays, because they are
screwed into the plates which they support. The size of the bar or screwed stays may be obtained as
discussed below :
Consider a short boiler having longitudinal bar stays as shown in Fig. 11.29.
Let
p = Pressure of steam in a boiler,
x = Pitch of the stays,
A = Area of the plate supported by each stay = x × x = x2
dc = Core diameter of the stays, and
σt = Permissible tensile stress for the material of the stays.
We know that force acting on the stay,
P = Pressure × Area = p.A = p.x2
Knowing the force P, we may determine the core diameter of the
stays by using the following relation,

From the core diameter, the standard size of the stay may be fixed from Table 11.1.

bolts having tensile stress as 56 MPa.
Solution. Given : p = 0.84 N/mm2 ; 
σt = 56 MPa = 56 N/mm2
Since the pitch of the stays is 350 mm, therefore area of the plate supported by each stay,
A = 350 × 350 = 122 500 mm2

11.16 Bolts of Uniform Strength
When a bolt is subjected to shock loading, as in case of a cylinder head bolt of an internal
combustion engine, the resilience of the bolt should be considered in order to prevent breakage at the
thread. In an ordinary bolt shown in Fig. 11.30 (a), the effect of the impulsive loads applied axially is
concentrated on the weakest part of the bolt i.e. the cross-sectional area at the root of the threads. In
other words, the stress in the threaded part of the bolt will be higher than that in the shank. Hence a
great portion of the energy will be absorbed at the region of the threaded part which may fracture the
threaded portion because of its small length.
Fig. 11.30. Bolts of uniform strength.
If the shank of the bolt is turned down to a diameter equal or even slightly less than the core
diameter of the thread (Dc) as shown in Fig. 11.30 (b), then shank of the bolt will undergo a higher
stress. This means that a shank will absorb a large portion of the energy, thus relieving the material at
the sections near the thread. The bolt, in this way, becomes stronger and lighter and it increases the
shock absorbing capacity of the bolt because of an increased modulus of resilience. This gives us
bolts of uniform strength. The resilience of a bolt may also be increased by increasing its length.
A second alternative method of obtaining the bolts of uniform strength is shown in Fig. 11.30 (c).
In this method, an axial hole is drilled through the head as far as the thread portion such that the area
of the shank becomes equal to the root area of the thread.
Let
D = Diameter of the hole.
Do = Outer diameter of the thread, and
Dc = Root or core diameter of the thread.

11.17 Design of a Nut
When a bolt and nut is made of mild steel, then the effective height of nut is made equal to the
nominal diameter of the bolt. If the nut is made of weaker material than the bolt, then the height of nut
should be larger, such as 1.5 d for gun metal, 2 d for cast iron and 2.5 d for aluminium alloys (where
d is the nominal diameter of the bolt). In case cast iron or aluminium nut is used, then V-threads are
permissible only for permanent fastenings, because threads in these materials are damaged due to
repeated screwing and unscrewing. When these materials are to be used for parts frequently removed
and fastened, a screw in steel bushing for cast iron and cast-in-bronze or monel metal insert should be
used for aluminium and should be drilled and tapped in place.
11.18 Bolted Joints under Eccentric Loading
There are many applications of the bolted joints which are subjected to eccentric loading such
as a wall bracket, pillar crane, etc. The eccentric load may be
1.
Parallel to the axis of the bolts,
2.
Perpendicular to the axis of the bolts, and
3.
In the plane containing the bolts.
We shall now discuss the above cases, in detail, in the following articles.
11.19 Eccentric Load Acting Parallel to the Axis of Bolts
Consider a bracket having a rectangular base bolted to a wall by means of four bolts as shown
in Fig. 11.31. A little consideration will show that each bolt is subjected to a direct tensile load of
Wt1 = 
W
n , where n is the number of bolts.
Fig. 11.31. Eccentric load acting parallel to the axis of bolts.
Further the load W tends to rotate the bracket about the edge A-A. Due to this, each bolt is
stretched by an amount that depends upon its distance from the tilting edge. Since the stress is a
function of *elongation, therefore each bolt will experience a different load which also depends upon
the distance from the tilting edge. For convenience, all the bolts are made of same size. In case the
flange is heavy, it may be considered as a rigid body.
Let w be the load in a bolt per unit distance due to the turning effect of the bracket and let W1 and
W2 be the loads on each of the bolts at distances L1 and L2 from the tilting edge.
*  We know that elongation is proportional to strain which in turn is proportional to stress within elastic limits.

∴Load on each bolt at distance L1,
W1 = w.L1
and moment of this load about the tilting edge
= w1.L1 × L1 = w (L1)2
Similarly, load on each bolt at distance L2,
W2 = w.L2
and moment of this load about the tilting edge
= w.L2 × L2 = w (L2)2
∴  Total moment of the load on the bolts about the tilting edge
= 2w (L1)2 + 2w (L2)2
...(i)
... ( Q There are two bolts each at distance of L1 and L2)
Also the moment due to load W about the tilting edge

Example 11.12. A bracket, as shown in Fig. 11.31, supports a load of 30 kN. Determine the size
of bolts, if the maximum allowable tensile stress in the bolt material is 60 MPa. The distances are :
L1 = 80 mm, L2 = 250 mm, and L = 500 mm.
Solution. Given : W = 30 kN ; σt = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ; L1 = 80 mm ; L2 = 250 mm ;
L = 500 mm

Since the heavily loaded bolts are those which lie at greater distance from the tilting edge,
therefore the bolts 2 and 3 will be heavily loaded.

11.20 Eccentric Load Acting Perpendicular to the Axis of Bolts
A wall bracket carrying an eccentric load perpendicular to the axis of the bolts is shown in
Fig. 11.34.
Fig. 11.34. Eccentric load perpendicular to the axis of bolts.
In this case, the bolts are subjected to direct shearing load which is equally shared by all the
bolts. Therefore direct shear load on each bolts,
Ws = W/n, where n is number of bolts.
A little consideration will show that the eccentric load W will try to tilt the bracket in the clock-
wise direction about the edge A-A. As discussed earlier, the bolts will be subjected to tensile stress
due to the turning moment. The maximum tensile load on a heavily loaded bolt (Wt) may be obtained
in the similar manner as discussed in the previous article. In this case, bolts 3 and 4 are heavily
loaded.

Example 11.14. For supporting the travelling crane in a workshop, the brackets are fixed on
steel columns as shown in Fig. 11.35. The maximum load that comes on the bracket is 12 kN acting
vertically at a distance of 400 mm from the face of the column. The vertical face of the bracket is
secured to a column by four bolts, in two rows (two in each row) at a
distance of 50 mm from the lower edge of the bracket. Determine the
size of the bolts if the permissible value of the tensile stress for the
bolt material is 84 MPa. Also find the cross-section of the arm of the
bracket which is rectangular.
Solution. Given : W = 12 kN = 12 × 103 N ; L = 400 mm ;

Since the load W will try to tilt the bracket in the clockwise direction about the lower edge,
therefore the bolts will be subjected to tensile load due to turning moment. The maximum loaded

Solution. Given : W = 40 kN = 40 × 103 N ; σt = 70 MPa = 70N/mm2 ; τ = 50 MPa

Since the load W = 40 kN is inclined at an angle of 60° to the vertical, therefore resolving it into
horizontal and vertical components. We know that horizontal component of 40 kN,
WH = 40 × sin 60° = 40 × 0.866 = 34.64 kN = 34 640 N
and vertical component of 40 kN,
WV = 40 × cos 60° = 40 × 0.5 = 20 kN = 20 000 N
Due to the horizontal component (WH), which acts parallel to the axis of the bolts as shown in
Fig. 11.37, the following two effects are produced :
Fig. 11.37
1.
A direct tensile load equally shared by all the four bolts, and
2.
A turning moment about the centre of gravity of the bolts, in the anticlockwise direction.
∴Direct tensile load on each bolt,
Wt1 =
H
34 640

W
=
 = 8660 N
Since the centre of gravity of all the four bolts lies in the centre at G (because of symmetrical
bolts), therefore the turning moment is in the anticlockwise direction. From the geometry of the
Fig. 11.37, we find that the distance of horizontal component from the centre of gravity (G) of the bolts
= 60 + 60 – 100 = 20 mm
∴Turning moment due to WH about G,
TH = WH × 20 = 34 640 × 20 = 692.8 × 103 N-mm
...(Anticlockwise)
Due to the vertical component WV, which acts perpendicular to the axis of the bolts as shown in
Fig. 11.37, the following two effects are produced:
1.
A direct shear load equally shared by all the four bolts, and
2.
A turning moment about the edge of the bracket in the clockwise direction.
∴Direct shear load on each bolt,
Ws =

W

Distance of vertical component from the edge E of the bracket,

∴ Turning moment due to WV about the edge of the bracket,
TV = WV × 175 = 20 000 × 175 = 3500 × 103 N-mm     (Clockwise)
Contents
Top
Screwed Joints     413
From above, we see that the clockwise moment is greater than the anticlockwise moment,
therefore,
Net turning moment = 3500 × 103 – 692.8 × 103 = 2807.2 × 103 N-mm (Clockwise)
...(i)
Due to this clockwise moment, the bracket tends to tilt about the lower edge E.
Let
w = Load on each bolt per mm distance from the edge E due to the turning
effect of the bracket,
L1 = Distance of bolts 1 and 2 from the tilting edge E = 60 mm, and
L2 = Distance of bolts 3 and 4 from the tilting edge E
= 60 + 120 = 180 mm
∴  Total moment of the load on the bolts about the tilting edge E
= 2 (w.L1) L1 + 2 (w.L2) L2
... ( Q There are two bolts each at distance L1 and L2.)
= 2w (L1)2 + 2w(L2)2 = 2w (60)2 + 2w(180)2
= 72 000 w N-mm
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii),
w = 2807.2 × 103 / 72 000 = 39 N/mm
Since the heavily loaded bolts are those which lie at a greater distance from the tilting edge,
therefore the upper bolts 3 and 4 will be heavily loaded. Thus the diameter of the bolt should be based
on the load on the upper bolts. We know that the maximum tensile load on each upper bolt,
Wt2 = w.L2 = 39 × 180 = 7020 N
∴Total tensile load on each of the upper bolt,
Wt = Wt1 + Wt2 = 8660 + 7020 = 15 680 N
Since each upper bolt is subjected to a tensile load (Wt = 15 680 N) and a shear load (Ws = 5000 N),
therefore equivalent tensile load,

Since the induced shear stress is less than the permissible stress (50 MPa), therefore the design
is safe.
Notes : 1. The value of ‘t’ may be obtained as discussed below :
Since the shear stress at the upper most fibres of the arm of the bracket is zero, therefore equating equation
(v) to the given safe tensile stress (i.e. 70 MPa), we have
2116.9
t
= 70      or
t = 2116.9 / 70 = 30.2 say 31 mm Ans.

compressive stress induced in the lower most fibres of the arm,

This value of thickness is low as compared to 31 mm as calculated above. Since the higher value is taken,

Example 11.16. An offset bracket, having arm of I-cross-section is fixed to a vertical steel

Determine : (a) the diameter of the fixing bolts, and (b) the dimensions of the arm of the bracket
if the ratio between b and t is 3 : 1.
For all parts, assume safe working stresses of 100 MPa in tension and 60 MPa in shear.
Solution. Given : W = 10 kN ; θ = 60° ; σ1 = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2
All dimensions in mm.
Fig. 11.39
Resolving the pull acting on the bracket (i.e. 10 kN) into horizontal and vertical components,
we have
Horizontal component of 10 kN,
WH = 10 × sin 60° = 10 × 0.866 = 8.66 kN = 8660 N
and vertical component of 10 kN,
WV = 10 cos 60° = 10 × 0.5 = 5 kN = 5000 N
Due to the horizontal component (WH), which acts parallel to the axis of the bolts, as shown in
Fig. 11.39, the following two effects are produced :
1.
A direct tensile load equally shared by all the four bolts, and
2.
A turning moment about the centre of gravity of the bolts. Since the centre of gravity of all
the four bolts lie in the centre at G (because of symmetrical bolts), therefore the turning
moment is in the clockwise direction.

∴ Turning moment due to WH about G,
TH = WH × 0.05 = 8660 × 0.05 = 433 N-m (Clockwise)
Due to the vertical component (WV), which acts perpendicular to the axis of the bolts, as shown
in Fig. 11.39, the following two effects are produced :
1.
A direct shear load equally shared by all the four bolts, and
2.
A turning moment about the edge of the bracket, in the anticlockwise direction.

Distance of vertical component from the edge of the bracket
= 300 mm = 0.3 m
∴ Turning moment about the edge of the bracket,
TV = WV × 0.3 = 5000 × 0.3 = 1500 N-m (Anticlockwise)
From above, we see that the anticlockwise moment is greater than the clockwise moment,
therefore
Net turning moment
= 1500 – 433 = 1067 N-m (Anticlockwise)
...(i)
Due to this anticlockwise moment, the bracket tends to tilt about the edge E.
Let
w = Load in each bolt per metre distance from the edge E, due to the turning
effect of the bracket,
L1 = Distance of bolts 1 and 2 from the tilting edge E
= 250

−
 = 37.5 mm = 0.0375 m
L3 = Distance of bolts 3 and 4 from the tilting edge
= L1 + 175 mm = 37.5 + 175 = 212.5 mm = 0.2125 m
∴Total moment of the load on the bolts about the tilting edge E
= 2 (w.L1) L1 + 2 (w.L2) L2  = 2w (L1)2 + 2w (L2)2
...(Q  There are two bolts each at distance L1 and L2.)
= 2w (0.0375)2 + 2w (0.2125)2 = 0.093 w N-m
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we have
w = 1067 / 0.093 = 11 470 N/m
Since the heavily loaded bolts are those which lie at a greater distance from the tilting edge,
therefore the upper bolts 3 and 4 will be heavily loaded.
∴Maximum tensile load on each upper bolt,
Wt2 = w.L2 = 11 470 × 0.2125 = 2435 N
and total tensile load on each of the upper bolt,
Wt = Wt1 + Wt2 = 2165 + 2435 = 4600 N

Determine : 1. The distance of the load from the centre of the pillar along a line X-X as shown
in Fig. 11.43 (a). The load lifted by the pillar crane is 60 kN and the allowable tensile stress for the
bolt material is 60 MPa.
Fig. 11.43
2. The maximum stress induced in the bolts if the load is applied along a line Y-Y of the
foundation as shown in Fig. 11.43 (b) at the same distance as in part (1).
Solution. Given : D = 600 mm or R = 300 mm ; n = 4; db = 30 mm ; d = 500 mm
or  r = 250 mm ; W = 60 kN ; σt = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2
Since the size of bolt (i.e. db = 30 mm), is given therefore from Table 11.1, we find that the
stress area corresponding to M 30 is 561 mm2.
We know that the maximum load carried by each bolt

∴ Total load carried by each bolt at distance L2 from the tilting edge A-A

From Fig. 11.43 (a), we find that
L1 = R – r cos 45° = 300 – 250 × 0.707 = 123 mm = 0.123 m
and
L2 = R + r cos 45° = 300 + 250 × 0.707 = 477 mm = 0.477 m
Let
w = Load (in kN) per bolt per unit distance.
∴  Total load carried by each bolt at distance L2 from the tilting edge A-A
= w.L2 = w × 0.477 kN
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we have
w = 48.66 / 0.477 = 102 kN/m
∴ Resisting moment of all the bolts about the outer (i.e. tilting) edge of the flange along the
tangent A-A
= 2w [(L1)2 + (L2)2] = 2 × 102 [(0.123)2 + (0.477)2] = 49.4 kN-m

Now equating the turning moment to the resisting moment of all the bolts, we have
60 (e – 0.3) = 49.4
∴
e – 0.3 = 49.4 / 60 = 0.823   or   e = 0.823 + 0.3 = 1.123 m Ans.
2. Maximum stress induced in the bolt
Since the load is applied along a line Y-Y as shown in Fig. 11.43 (b), and at the same distance as
in part (1) i.e. at L = e – 0.3 = 1.123 – 0.3 = 0.823 m from the tilting edge B-B, therefore
Turning moment due to load W about the tilting edge B–B
= W.L = 60 × 0.823 = 49.4 kN-m
From Fig. 11.43 (b), we find that
L1 = R – r = 300 – 250 = 50 mm = 0.05 m
L2 = R = 300 mm = 0.3 m
and
L3 = R + r = 300 + 250 = 550 mm = 0.55 m
∴Resisting moment of all the bolts about B–B
= w [(L1)2 + 2(L2)2 + (L3)2] = w[(0.05)2 + 2(0.3)2 + (0.55)2] kN-m
= 0.485 w kN-m
Equating resisting moment of all the bolts to the turning moment, we have
0.485 w = 49.4
or
w = 49.4 / 0.485 = 102 kN/m
Since the bolt at a distance of L3 is heavily loaded, therefore load carried by this bolt
= w.L3 = 102 × 0.55 = 56.1 kN

11.22 Eccentric Load Acting in the Plane
  Containing  the Bolts
When the eccentric load acts in the plane containing the bolts,
as shown in Fig. 11.44, then the same procedure may be followed
as discussed for eccentric loaded riveted joints.
Example 11.20. Fig. 11.45 shows a solid forged bracket to carry a vertical load of 13.5 kN
applied through the centre of hole. The square flange is secured to the flat side of a vertical stanchion
through four bolts. Calculate suitable diameter D and d for the arms of the bracket, if the permissible
stresses are 110 MPa in tension and 65 MPa in shear.
Estimate also the tensile load on each top bolt and the maximum shearing force on each bolt.
Solution. Given : W = 13.5 kN = 13 500 N ; σt = 110 MPa = 110 N/mm2 ; τ = 65 MPa
= 65 N/mm2

Diameter D for the arm of the bracket
The section of the arm having D as the diameter is subjected to bending moment as well as
twisting moment. We know that bending moment,
M = 13 500 × (300 – 25) = 3712.5 × 103 N-mm

Tensile load on each top bolt
Due to the eccentric load W, the bracket has a tendency to tilt about the edge E–E, as shown in
Fig. 11.46.
Let
w = Load on each bolt per mm distance from the tilting edge due to the
tilting effect of the bracket.
Since there are two bolts each at distance L1 and L2 as shown in Fig. 11.46, therefore total
moment of the load on the bolts about the tilting edge E–E
= 2 (w.L1) L1 + 2(w.L2) L2 = 2w [(L1)2 + (L2)2]
= 2w [(37.5)2 + (237.5)2] = 115 625 w N-mm
...(i)
...(Q L1 = 37.5 mm and L2 = 237.5 mm)
and turning moment of the load about the tilting edge
= W.L = 13 500 × 300 = 4050 × 103 N-mm
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we have
w = 4050 × 103 / 115 625 = 35.03 N/mm
∴Tensile load on each top bolt
= w.L2 = 35.03 × 237.5 = 8320 N Ans.

Since all the bolts are at equal distances from the centre of gravity of the four bolts (G),
therefore the secondary shear load on each bolt is same.

Since the secondary shear load acts at right angles to the line joining the centre of gravity of the
bolt group to the centre of the bolt as shown in Fig. 11.47, therefore the resultant of the primary and
secondary shear load on each bolt gives the maximum shearing force on each bolt.

12.1  Introduction
A cotter is a flat wedge shaped piece of rectangular
cross-section and its width is tapered (either on one side or
both sides) from one end to another for an easy adjustment.
The taper varies from 1 in 48 to 1 in 24 and it may be
increased up to 1 in 8, if a locking device is provided. The
locking device may be a taper pin or a set screw used on the
lower end of the cotter. The cotter is usually made of mild
steel or wrought iron. A cotter joint is a temporary fastening
and is used to connect rigidly two co-axial rods or bars
which are subjected to axial tensile or compressive forces.
It is usually used in connecting a piston rod to the cross-
head of a reciprocating steam engine, a piston rod and its
extension as a tail or pump rod, strap end of connecting rod
etc.

12.2 Types of Cotter Joints
Following are the three commonly used cotter joints to connect two rods by a cotter :
1. Socket and spigot cotter joint,    2.    Sleeve and cotter joint, and     3.  Gib and cotter joint.
The design of these types of joints are discussed, in detail, in the following pages.
12.3 Socket and Spigot Cotter Joint
In a socket and spigot cotter joint, one end of the rods (say A) is provided with a socket type of
end as shown in Fig. 12.1 and the other end of the other rod (say B) is inserted into a socket. The end
of the rod which goes into a socket is also called spigot. A rectangular hole is made in the socket and
spigot. A cotter is then driven tightly through a hole in order to make the temporary connection
between the two rods. The load is usually acting axially, but it changes its direction and hence the
cotter joint must be designed to carry both the tensile and compressive loads. The compressive load
is taken up by the collar on the spigot.
Fig. 12.1. Socket and spigot cotter joint.
12.4  Design of Socket and Spigot Cotter Joint
The socket and spigot cotter joint is shown in Fig. 12.1.
Let
P = Load carried by the rods,
d = Diameter of the rods,
d1 = Outside diameter of socket,
d2 = Diameter of spigot or inside diameter of socket,
d3 = Outside diameter of spigot collar,
t1 = Thickness of spigot collar,
d4 = Diameter of socket collar,
c = Thickness of socket collar,
b = Mean width of cotter,
t = Thickness of cotter,
l = Length of cotter,
a = Distance from the end of the slot to the end of rod,
σt = Permissible tensile stress for the rods material,
τ = Permissible shear stress for the cotter material, and
σc = Permissible crushing stress for the cotter material.

The dimensions for a socket and
spigot cotter joint may be obtained by
considering the various modes of failure
as discussed below :
1. Failure of the rods in tension
The rods may fail in tension due to
the tensile load P. We know that
Area resisting tearing

∴ Tearing strength of the rods,

From this equation, diameter of the
rods ( d ) may be determined.
2.  Failure of spigot in tension across the weakest section (or slot)
Since the weakest section of the spigot is that section which
has a slot in it for the cotter, as shown in Fig. 12.2, therefore
Area resisting tearing of the spigot across the slot

Note : In actual practice, the thickness of cotter is usually taken as d2 / 4.
3. Failure of the rod or cotter in crushing
We know that the area that resists crushing of a rod or cotter
=d2 × t
∴ Crushing strength = d2 × t × σc
Equating this to load (P), we have
P =d2 × t × σc
From this equation, the induced crushing stress may be checked.

From this equation, outside diameter of socket (d1) may be determined.
5. Failure of cotter in shear
Considering the failure of cotter in shear as shown in Fig. 12.4. Since the cotter is in double
shear, therefore shearing area of the cotter
= 2 b × t
and shearing strength of the cotter
=2 b × t × τ
Equating this to load (P), we have
P =2 b × t × τ
From this equation, width of cotter (b) is determined.
6. Failure of the socket collar in crushing
Considering the failure of socket collar in crushing as shown in
Fig. 12.5.
We know that area that resists crushing of socket collar
=(d4 – d2) t
and crushing strength =(d4 – d2) t × σc
Equating this to load (P), we have
P =(d4 – d2) t × σc
From this equation, the diameter of socket collar (d4) may
be obtained.
7.  Failure of socket end in shearing
Since the socket end is in double shear, therefore area that
resists shearing of socket collar
=2 (d4 – d2) c
and shearing strength of socket collar
=2 (d4 – d2) c × τ
Equating this to load (P), we have
P =2 (d4 – d2) c × τ
From this equation, the thickness of socket collar (c) may be obtained.

8. Failure of rod end in shear
Since the rod end is in double shear, therefore the area resisting shear of the rod end
= 2 a × d2
and shear strength of the rod end
= 2 a × d2 × τ
Equating this to load (P), we have
P = 2 a × d2 × τ
From this equation, the distance from the end of the slot to the end of the rod (a) may be
obtained.

10. Failure of the spigot collar in shearing
Considering the failure of the spigot collar in shearing as
shown in Fig. 12.7. We know that area that resists shearing of the
collar
= π d2 × t1
and shearing strength of the collar,
= π d2 × t1 × τ
Equating this to load (P) we have
P = π d2 × t1 × τ
From this equation, the thickness of spigot
collar (t1) may be obtained.
11. Failure of cotter in bending
In all the above relations, it is assumed
that the load is uniformly distributed over the
various cross-sections of the joint. But in actual
practice, this does not happen and the cotter is
subjected to bending. In order to find out the
bending stress induced, it is assumed that the
load on the cotter in the rod end is uniformly
distributed while in the socket end it varies from
zero at the outer diameter (d4) and maximum at
the inner diameter (d2), as shown in Fig. 12.8.

This bending stress induced in the cotter should be less than the allowable bending stress of
the cotter.
12.The length of cotter (l) is taken as 4 d.
13. The taper in cotter should not exceed 1 in 24. In case the greater taper is required, then a
locking device must be provided.
14.The draw of cotter is generally taken as 2 to 3 mm.
Notes: 1. When all the parts of the joint are made of steel, the following proportions in terms of diameter of the
rod (d) are generally adopted :
d1 = 1.75 d ,  d2 = 1.21 d ,  d3 = 1.5 d ,  d4 = 2.4 d ,  a = c = 0.75 d ,  b = 1.3 d,  l = 4 d ,  t = 0.31 d ,
 t1 = 0.45 d ,  e = 1.2 d.
Taper of cotter = 1 in 25, and draw of cotter = 2 to 3 mm.
2. If the rod and cotter are made of steel or wrought iron, then τ = 0.8 σt and σc = 2 σt may be taken.
Example 12.1. Design and draw a cotter joint to support a load varying from 30 kN in
compression to 30 kN in tension. The material used is carbon steel for which the following
allowable stresses may be used. The load is applied statically.
Tensile stress = compressive stress = 50 MPa ; shear stress = 35 MPa and crushing stress
= 90 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 30 kN = 30 × 103 N ; σt = 50 MPa = 50 N / mm2 ; τ = 35 MPa = 35 N / mm2 ;
σc = 90 MPa = 90 N/mm2

d2 = Diameter of spigot or inside diameter of socket, and

∴
(d2)2 = 30 × 103 / 26.8 = 1119.4    or    d2 = 33.4 say 34 mm

Let us now check the induced crushing stress. We know that load (P),
30 × 103 = d2 × t × σc = 34 × 8.5 × σc = 289 σc
∴
σc = 30 × 103 / 289 = 103.8 N/mm2
Since this value of σc is more than the given value of σc = 90 N/mm2, therefore the dimensions d2
= 34 mm and t = 8.5 mm are not safe. Now let us find the values of d2 and t by substituting the value of
σc = 90 N/mm2 in the above expression, i.e.
30 × 103 =

∴

6. Thickness of socket collar
Let

therefore load (P),

12.5  Sleeve and Cotter Joint
Sometimes, a sleeve and cotter joint as shown in Fig. 12.9, is used to connect two round rods or
bars. In this type of joint, a sleeve or muff is used over the two rods and then two cotters (one on each
rod end) are inserted in the holes provided for them in the sleeve and rods. The taper of cotter is
usually 1 in 24. It may be noted that the taper sides of the two cotters should face each other as shown
in Fig. 12.9. The clearance is so adjusted that when the cotters are driven in, the two rods come closer
to each other thus making the joint tight.

The various proportions for the sleeve and cotter joint in terms of the diameter of rod (d ) are as
follows :

The sleeve and cotter joint is shown in Fig. 12.9.
Let
P = Load carried by the rods,
d = Diameter of the rods,
d1 = Outside diameter of sleeve,
d2 = Diameter of the enlarged end of rod,
t = Thickness of cotter,
l = Length of cotter,

(inside the sleeve end),
c = Distance of the rod end from its end to the cotter hole,
σt ,  τ  and σc = Permissible tensile, shear and crushing stresses respectively
for the material of the rods and cotter.
The dimensions for a sleeve and cotter joint may be obtained by considering the various modes

5.  Failure of cotter in shear
Since the cotter is in double shear, therefore shearing area of the cotter
= 2b × t
and shear strength of the cotter
= 2b × t × τ
Equating this to load (P), we have
P = 2b × t × τ
From this equation, width of cotter (b) may be determined.

and shear strength of the rod end
= 2 a × d2 × τ
Equating this to load (P), we have
P = 2 a × d2 × τ
From this equation, distance (a) may be determined.
7. Failure of sleeve end in shear
Since the sleeve end is in double shear, therefore the area resisting shear of the sleeve end
= 2 (d1 – d2) c
and shear strength of the sleeve end
= 2 (d1 – d2 ) c × τ
Equating this to load (P), we have
P = 2 (d1 – d2 ) c × τ
From this equation, distance (c) may be determined.
Example 12.2. Design a sleeve and cotter joint to resist a tensile load of 60 kN. All parts of the
joint are made of the same material with the following allowable stresses :
σt = 60 MPa ; τ = 70 MPa ; and σc = 125 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 60 kN = 60 × 103 N ; σt = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ; τ = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2 ;
σc = 125 MPa = 125 N/mm2

Let
d2 =  Diameter of enlarged end of rod, and
t =  Thickness of cotter. It may be taken as d2 / 4.

Let us now check the induced crushing stress in the rod or cotter. We know that load (P),

∴
σc = 60 × 103 / 484 = 124 N/mm2
Since the induced crushing stress is less than the given value of 125 N/mm2, therefore the
dimensions d2 and t are within safe limits.

444    A Textbook of Machine Design
A *gib and cotter joint is usually used in strap end (or big end) of a connecting rod as shown in
Fig. 12.10. In such cases, when the cotter alone (i.e. without gib) is driven, the friction between its
ends and the inside of the slots in the strap tends to cause the sides of the strap to spring open (or
spread) outwards as shown dotted in Fig. 12.11 (a). In order to prevent this, gibs as shown in
Fig. 12.11 (b) and (c), are used which hold together the ends of the strap. Moreover, gibs
provide a larger bearing surface for the cotter to slide on, due to the increased holding power. Thus,
the tendency of cotter to slacken back owing to friction is considerably decreased. The jib, also,
enables parallel holes to be used.
Fig. 12.11. Gib and cotter Joints.
Notes : 1. When one gib is used, the cotter with one side tapered is provided and the gib is always on the outside
as shown in Fig. 12.11 (b).
2. When two jibs are used, the cotter with both sides tapered is provided.
3. Sometimes to prevent loosening of cotter, a small set screw is used through the rod jamming against the
cotter.
12.8  Design of a Gib and Cotter Joint for Strap End of a Connecting Rod

Consider a gib and cotter joint for strap end (or big end) of a connecting rod as shown in
Fig. 12.12. The connecting rod is subjected to tensile and compressive loads.

Let
P = Maximum thrust or pull in the connecting rod,
d = Diameter of the adjacent end of the round part of the rod,
B1 = Width of the strap,
B = Total width of gib and cotter,
t = Thickness of cotter,
t1 = Thickness of the strap at the thinnest part,
σt = Permissible tensile stress for the material of the strap, and
τ = Permissible shear stress for the material of the cotter and gib.
The width of strap ( B1) is generally taken equal to the diameter of the adjacent end of the round

Height (t2) and length of gib head (l3)

In designing the gib and cotter joint for strap end of a connecting rod, the following modes of
failure are considered.
1. Failure of the strap in tension
Assuming that no hole is provided for lubrication, the area that resists the failure of the strap
due to tearing
= 2 B1 × t1
∴Tearing strength of the strap
= 2 B1 × t1 × σt
Equating this to the load (P), we get
P = 2 B1 × t1 × σt
From this equation, the thickness of the strap at the thinnest part (t1) may be obtained. When an
oil hole is provided in the strap, then its weakening effect should be considered.
The thickness of the strap at the cotter (t3) is increased such that the area of cross-section of the
strap at the cotter hole is not less than the area of the strap at the thinnest part. In other words
2 t3 (B1 – t) = 2 t1 × B1
From this expression, the value of t3 may be obtained.

2. Failure of the gib and cotter in shearing
Since the gib and cotter are in double shear, therefore area resisting failure
= 2 B × t
and  resisting strength
= 2 B × t × τ
Equating this to the load (P), we get
P = 2 B × t × τ
From this equation, the total width of gib and cotter (B) may be obtained. In the joint, as shown
in Fig. 12.12, one gib is used, the proportions of which are
Width of gib,b1 =0.55 B ; and width of cotter, b = 0.45 B
The other dimensions may be fixed as follows :
Thickness of the strap at the crown,
t4 = 1.15 t1 to 1.5 t1
l1 = 2 t1; and l2 = 2.5 t1
Example 12.3. The big end of a connecting rod, as shown in Fig. 12.12, is subjected to a
maximum load of 50 kN. The diameter of the circular part of the rod adjacent to the strap end is
75 mm. Design the joint, assuming permissible tensile stress for the material of the strap as 25 MPa
and permissible shear stress for the material of cotter and gib as 20 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 50 kN = 50 × 103 N ; d = 75 mm ; σt = 25 MPa = 25 N/mm2 ; τ = 20 MPa
= 20 N/mm2
1. Width of the strap
Let
B1 = Width of the strap.
The width of the strap is generally made equal to the diameter of the adjacent end of the round
part of the rod (d).
∴
B1 = d = 75 mm  Ans.
Other dimensions are fixed as follows :

t =

B =

Thickness of gib

Height (t2) and length of gib head (l3)
= Thickness of cotter = 20 mm   Ans.
2. Thickness of the strap at the thinnest part
Let
t1 = Thickness of the strap at the thinnest part.
Considering the failure of the strap in tension. We know that load (P),
50 × 103 = 2 B1 × t1 × σt = 2 × 75 × t1 × 25 = 3750 t1
∴
t1 = 50 × 103 / 3750 = 13.3 say 15 mm  Ans.
3. Thickness of the strap at the cotter
Let
t3 = Thickness of the strap at the cotter.
The thickness of the strap at the cotter is increased such that the area of the cross-section of the
strap at the cotter hole is not less than the area of the strap at the thinnest part. In other words,
     
    2 t3 (B1 – t)
= 2 t1 × B1
  2 t3 (75 – 20)
= 2 × 15 × 75
or
110 t3 = 2250
∴
         t3
= 2250 / 110 = 20.45   say   21 mm  Ans.

4. Total width of gib and cotter
Let
B = Total width of gib and cotter.
Considering the failure of gib and cotter in double shear. We know that load (P),
50 × 103 = 2 B × t × τ = 2 B × 20 × 20 = 800 B
∴
B = 50 × 103 / 800 = 62.5  say  65  mm  Ans.
Since one gib is used, therefore width of gib,
b1 = 0.55 B = 0.55 × 65 = 35.75  say  36 mm  Ans.
and width of cotter,
b = 0.45 B = 0.45 × 65 = 29.25  say  30  mm Ans.
The other dimensions are fixed as follows :
t4 = 1.25 t1 = 1.25 × 15 = 18.75  say  20  mm  Ans.
l1 = 2 t1 = 2 × 15 = 30 mm  Ans.
and
l2 = 2.5 t1 = 2.5 × 15 = 37.5 say  40  mm  Ans.
12.9  Design of Gib and Cotter Joint for Square Rods
Consider a gib and cotter joint for square rods as shown in Fig. 12.13. The rods may be subjected
to a tensile or compressive load. All components of the joint are assumed to be of the same material.
Fig. 12.13. Gib and cotter joint for square rods.
Let
P = Load carried by the rods,
x = Each side of the rod,
B = Total width of gib and cotter,
B1 = Width of the strap,
t = Thickness of cotter,
t1 = Thickness of the strap, and
σt , τ and σc = Permissible tensile, shear and crushing stresses.
In designing a gib and cotter joint, the following modes of failure are considered.
1. Failure of the rod in tension
The rod may fail in tension due to the tensile load P. We know that
Area resisting tearing = x × x = x2
∴Tearing strength of the rod
= x2 × σt
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = x2 × σt

Thickness of gib

Height (t2) and length of gib head (l4)

2. Failure of the gib and cotter in shearing
Since the gib and cotter are in double shear, therefore,
Area resisting failure
= 2 B × t
and resisting strength
= 2 B × t × τ
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = 2B × t × τ
From this equation, the width of gib and cotter (B) may be obtained. In the joint, as shown in Fig.
12.13, one gib is used, the proportions of which are
Width of gib,     b1 = 0.55 B ; and width of cotter, b = 0.45 B
In case two gibs are used, then
Width of each gib  = 0.3 B ; and width of cotter = 0.4 B
3. Failure of the strap end in tension at the location of gib and cotter
Area resisting failure
= 2 [B1 × t1 – t1 × t] = 2 [x × t1 – t1 × t]
... (Q B1 = x)
∴  Resisting strength
= 2 [ x × t1 – t1 × t] σt
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = 2 [x × t1 – t1 × t] σt
From this equation, the thickness of strap (t1) may be determined.
4. Failure of the strap or gib in crushing
The strap or gib (at the strap hole) may fail due to crushing.
Area resisting failure
= 2 t1 × t
∴   Resisting strength
= 2 t1 × t × σc
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = 2 t1 × t × σc
From this equation, the induced crushing stress may be checked.
5. Failure of the rod end in shearing
Since the rod is in double shear, therefore
Area resisting failure
= 2 l1 × x
∴     Resisting strength
= 2 l1 × x × τ
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = 2 l1 × x × τ
From this equation, the dimension l1 may be determined.
6. Failure of the strap end in shearing
Since the length of rod (l2) is in double shearing, therefore
Area resisting failure
= 2 × 2 l2 × t1
Contents
Top
Cotter and Knuckle Joints      449
∴      Resisting strength
= 2 × 2 l2 × t1 × τ
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = 2 × 2 l2 × t1 × τ
From this equation, the length of rod (l2) may be determined. The length l3 of the strap end is
proportioned as 
2
3 rd of side of the rod. The clearance is usually kept 3 mm. The length of cotter is
generally taken as 4 times the side of the rod.
Example 12.4. Design a gib and cottor joint as shown in Fig. 12.13, to carry a maximum load
of 35 kN. Assuming that the gib, cotter and rod are of same material and have the following
allowable stresses :
σt  = 20 MPa ; τ = 15 MPa ; and σc = 50 MPa
Solution. Given : P = 35 kN = 35 000 N ; σt = 20 MPa = 20 N/mm2 ; τ = 15 MPa = 15 N/mm2 ;
σc = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2
1. Side of the square rod
Let
x = Each side of the square rod.
Considering the failure of the rod in tension. We know that load (P),
35  000 = x2 × σt = x2 × 20 = 20 x2
∴
x2 = 35 000 / 20 = 1750  or  x  =  41.8  say  42  mm  Ans.
Other dimensions are fixed as follows :
Width of strap,
B1 = x =  42 mm Ans.
Thickness of cotter,
t =
1
42
4

B =
 = 10.5 say 12 mm Ans.
Thickness of gib
= Thickness of cotter = 12 mm Ans.
Height (t2) and length of gib head (l4)
= Thickness of cotter = 12 mm Ans.
2. Width of gib and cotter
Let
B = Width of gib and cotter.
Considering the failure of the gib and cotter in double shear. We know that load (P),
35  000 = 2 B × t × τ = 2 B × 12 × 15 = 360 B
∴
B = 35 000 / 360 = 97.2 say 100 mm Ans.
Since one gib is used, therefore
Width of gib,
b1 = 0.55 B = 0.55 × 100 = 55 mm Ans.
and width of cotter,
b = 0.45 B = 0.45 × 100 = 45 mm Ans.
3. Thickness of strap
Let
t1 = Thickness of strap.
Considering the failure of the strap end in tension at the location of the gib and cotter. We know
that load (P),
35  000 = 2 (x × t1 – t1 × t) σt = 2 (42 × t1 – t1 × 12) 20 = 1200 t1
∴
t1 = 35 000 / 1200 = 29.1 say 30 mm Ans.
Now the induced crushing stress may be checked by considering the failure of the strap or gib
in crushing. We know that load (P),
35  000 = 2 t1 × t × σc = 2 × 30 × 12 × σc = 720 σc
∴
σc = 35 000 / 720 = 48.6 N/mm2
Since the induced crushing stress is less than the given crushing stress, therefore the joint is safe.

4. Length (l1) of the rod
Considering the failure of the rod end in shearing. Since the rod is in double shear, therefore load
(P),
35  000 = 2 l1 × x × τ = 2 l1 × 42 × 15 = 1260 l1
∴
l1 = 35 000 / 1260 = 27.7 say 28 mm Ans.
5.  Length (l2 ) of the rod
Considering the failure of the strap end in shearing. Since the length of the rod (l2) is in double
shear, therefore load (P),
35  000 = 2 × 2 l2 × t1 × τ = 2 × 2 l2 × 30 × 15 = 1800 l2
∴

Design of Cotter Joint to Connect Piston Rod and Crosshead

the purpose. The taper may be from 1 in 24 to 1 in 12.

4. Failure of socket in crushing
We know that area that resists crushing of socket
= (d3 – d2) t
and crushing strength of socket
= (d3 – d2) t × σc
Equating this to maximum load (P), we have
P = (d3 – d2) t × σc
From this equation, the induced crushing stress in the socket may be checked.
The length of the tapered portion of the piston rod (L) is taken as 2.2 d2. The diameter of the
parallel part of the piston rod (d) and diameter of the piston rod at the tapered end (d1) may be obtained

Example 12.5. Design a cotter joint to connect piston rod to the crosshead of a double acting
steam engine. The diameter of the cylinder is 300 mm and the steam pressure is 1 N/mm2. The
allowable stresses for the material of cotter and piston rod are as follows :
σt = 50 MPa ; τ = 40 MPa ; and σc = 84 MPa
Solution. Given : D = 300 mm ;  p = 1 N/mm2 ;  σt = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2 ;  τ = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2 ;
σc = 84 MPa = 84 N/mm2

2. Width of cotter
Let

Considering the failure of cotter in shear. Since the cotter is in double shear, therefore load (P),

∴
b = 70 695 / 1320 = 53.5 say 54 mm Ans.

∴
σc = 70 695 / 280.5  =  252 N/mm2
Since the induced crushing is greater than the permissible value of 84 N/mm2, therefore let us

find the value of d3 by substituting σc = 84 N/mm2 in the
above expression, i.e.
          70  695   = (d3 – 55) 16.5 × 84  =  (d3 – 55) 1386
∴      d3 – 55   =  70 695 / 1386  =  51

Design of Cotter Foundation Bolt
The cotter foundation bolt is mostly used in conjunction
with foundation and holding down bolts to fasten heavy
machinery to foundations. It is generally used where an
ordinary bolt or stud cannot be conveniently used. Fig. 12.15
shows the two views of the application of such a cotter
foundation bolt. In this case, the bolt is dropped down from
above and the cotter is driven in from the side. Now this
assembly is tightened by screwing down the nut. It may be
noted that two base plates (one under the nut and the other
under the cotter) are used to provide more bearing area in
order to take up the tightening load on the bolt as well as to
distribute the same uniformly over the large surface.

∴Shearing strength of cotter

P = 2 b × t × τ
From this equation, the width of cotter (b) may be determined.

∴Crushing strength of cotter

Example 12.6. Design and draw a cottered foundation bolt which is subjected to a maximum

Solution. Given: P = 50 kN = 50 × 103 N ; σt = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; τ = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2  ;

Considering the failure of cotter in shear. Since the cotter is in double shear, therefore load (P),
50 × 103 = 2 b × t × τ = 2 b × 9 × 50 = 900 b
∴
b = 50 × 103 / 900  =  55.5 mm  say  60 mm   Ans.
Let us now check the crushing stress induced in the cotter. Considering the failure of cotter in
crushing. We know that load (P),
50 × 103 = b × t × σc = 60 × 9 × σc = 540 σc
∴
σc = 50 × 103 / 540  =  92.5 N/mm2
Since the induced crushing stress is less than the permissible value of 100 N/mm2, therefore the
design is safe.

Knuckle Joint
A knuckle joint is used to connect two rods which are under the action of tensile loads.
However, if the joint is guided, the rods may support a compressive load. A knuckle joint may be
readily disconnected for adjustments or repairs. Its use may be found in the link of a cycle chain, tie
rod joint for roof truss, valve rod joint with eccentric rod, pump rod joint, tension link in bridge
structure and lever and rod connections of various types.

Fig. 12.16. Kunckle joint.
In knuckle joint (the two views of which
are shown in Fig. 12.16), one end of one of the
rods is made into an eye and the end of the
other rod is formed into a fork with an eye in
each of the fork leg. The knuckle pin passes
through both the eye hole and the fork holes
and may be secured by means of a collar and
taper pin or spilt pin. The knuckle pin may be
prevented from rotating in the fork by means of
a small stop, pin, peg or snug. In order to get a
better quality of joint, the sides of the fork and
eye are machined, the hole is accurately drilled
and pin turned. The material used for the joint
may be steel or wrought iron.
12.13
Dimensions of Various Parts
of  the Knuckle Joint
The dimensions of various parts of the
knuckle joint are fixed by empirical relations as
given below. It may be noted that all the parts
should be made of the same material i.e. mild
steel or wrought iron.

Methods of Failure of Knuckle Joint
Consider a knuckle joint as shown in Fig. 12.16.
Let
P = Tensile load acting on the rod,
d = Diameter of the rod,
d1 = Diameter of the pin,
d2 = Outer diameter of eye,
t = Thickness of single eye,
t1 = Thickness of fork.
σt ,  τ and σc = Permissible stresses for the joint material in tension, shear and
crushing respectively.
In determining the strength of the joint for the various methods of failure, it is assumed that
1.
There is no stress concentration, and
2.
The load is uniformly distributed over each part of the joint.
Due to these assumptions, the strengths are approximate, however they serve to indicate a well
proportioned joint. Following are the various methods of failure of the joint :
1. Failure of the solid rod in tension
Since the rods are subjected to direct tensile load, therefore tensile strength of the rod,

2. Failure of the knuckle pin in shear

From this equation, diameter of the knuckle pin (d1) is obtained. This assumes that there is no
slack and clearance between the pin and the fork and hence there is no bending of the pin. But, in
Contents
Top
458    A Textbook of Machine Design
actual practice, the knuckle pin is loose in forks in order to permit angular movement of one with
respect to the other, therefore the pin is subjected to bending in addition to shearing. By making the
diameter of knuckle pin equal to the diameter of the rod (i.e., d1 = d), a margin of strength is provided
to allow for the bending of the pin.
In case, the stress due to bending is taken into account, it is assumed that the load on the pin is
uniformly distributed along the middle portion (i.e. the eye end) and varies uniformly over the forks as
shown in Fig. 12.17. Thus in the forks, a load P/2 acts through a distance of t1 / 3 from the inner edge
and the bending moment will be maximum at the centre of the pin. The value of maximum bending
moment is given by

3. Failure of the single eye or rod end in tension
The single eye or rod end may tear off due to the tensile load. We know that area resisting
tearing
= (d2 – d1) t
∴  Tearing strength of single eye or rod end
= (d2 – d1) t × σt
Equating this to the load (P) we have
P = (d2 – d1) t × σt
From this equation, the induced tensile stress (σt) for the single eye or rod end may be checked.
In case the induced tensile stress is more than the allowable working stress, then increase the outer
diameter of the eye (d2).
4. Failure of the single eye or rod end in shearing
The single eye or rod end may fail in shearing due to tensile load. We know that area resisting
shearing                                = (d2 – d1) t
∴   Shearing strength of single eye or rod end
                                      =  (d2 – d1) t × τ
Equating this to the load (P), we have
                                   P = (d2 – d1) t × τ
From this equation, the induced shear stress (τ) for the single eye or rod end may be checked.

5. Failure of the single eye or rod end in crushing
The single eye or pin may fail in crushing due to the tensile load. We know that area resisting
crushing
= d1 × t
∴Crushing strength of single eye or rod end
= d1 × t × σc
Equating this to the load (P), we have
∴
P = d1 × t × σc
From this equation, the induced crushing stress (σc) for the single eye or pin may be checked. In
case the induced crushing stress in more than the allowable working stress, then increase the
thickness of the single eye (t).
6. Failure of the forked end in tension
The forked end or double eye may fail in tension due to the tensile load. We know that area
resisting tearing
= (d2 – d1) × 2 t1
∴Tearing strength of the forked end
= (d2 – d1) × 2 t1 × σt
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = (d2 – d1) × 2t1 × σt
From this equation, the induced tensile stress for the forked end may be checked.
7. Failure of the forked end in shear
The forked end may fail in shearing due to the tensile load. We know that area resisting shearing
= (d2 – d1) × 2t1
∴Shearing strength of the forked end
= (d2 – d1) × 2t1 × τ
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = (d2 – d1) × 2t1 × τ
From this equation, the induced shear stress for the forked end may be checked. In case, the
induced shear stress is more than the allowable working stress, then thickness of the fork (t1) is
increased.
8. Failure of the forked end in crushing
The forked end or pin may fail in crushing due to the tensile load. We know that area resisting
crushing
= d1 × 2 t1
∴Crushing strength of the forked end
= d1 × 2 t1 × σc
Equating this to the load (P), we have
P = d1 × 2 t1 × σc
From this equation, the induced crushing stress for the forked end may be checked.
Note: From the above failures of the joint, we see that the thickness of fork (t1) should be equal to half the
thickness of single eye (t / 2). But, in actual practice t1 > t / 2 in order to prevent deflection or spreading of the forks
which would introduce excessive bending of pin.

Design Procedure of Knuckle Joint
The empirical dimensions as discussed in Art. 12.13 have been formulated after wide experience
on a particular service. These dimensions are of more practical value than the theoretical analysis.
Thus, a designer should consider the empirical relations in designing a knuckle joint. The following
Contents

procedure may be adopted :
1. First of all, find the diameter of the rod by considering the failure of the rod in tension. We
know that tensile load acting on the rod,
P =
2

t
d
π ×
× σ
where
d = Diameter of the rod, and
σt = Permissible tensile stress for the material of the rod.
2. After determining the diameter of the rod, the diameter of pin (d1) may be determined by
considering the failure of the pin in shear. We know that load,
P =

(
)
4
π
×
τ
d
A little consideration will show that the value of d1 as obtained by the above relation is less than
the specified value (i.e. the diameter of rod). So fix the diameter of the pin equal to the diameter of the
rod.
3. Other dimensions of the joint are fixed by empirical relations as discussed in Art. 12.13.
4. The induced stresses are obtained by substituting the empirical dimensions in the relations
as discussed in Art. 12.14.
In case the induced stress is more than the allowable stress, then the corresponding dimension
may be increased.
Example 12.7. Design a knuckle joint to transmit 150 kN. The design stresses may be taken as
75 MPa in tension, 60 MPa in shear and 150 MPa in compression.
Solution. Given : P = 150 kN = 150 × 103 N ; σt = 75 MPa = 75 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ;
 σc = 150 MPa = 150 N/mm2
The knuckle joint is shown in Fig. 12.16. The joint is designed by considering the various
methods of failure as discussed below :
1. Failure of the solid rod in tension
Let
d = Diameter of the rod.
We know that the load transmitted (P),

∴
d2 = 150 × 103 / 59  =  2540        or     d  =  50.4 say  52 mm  Ans.
Now the various dimensions are fixed as follows :
Diameter of knuckle pin,
d1 = d  =  52 mm
Outer diameter of eye,
d2 = 2 d  =  2 × 52  =  104 mm
Diameter of knuckle pin head and collar,
d3 = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 52  =  78 mm
Thickness of single eye or rod end,
t = 1.25 d  =  1.25 × 52  =  65 mm
Thickness of fork,
t1 = 0.75 d  =  0.75 × 52  =  39  say  40 mm
Thickness of pin head,
 t2 = 0.5 d  =  0.5 × 52  =  26 mm
2. Failure of the knuckle pin in shear
Since the knuckle pin is in double shear, therefore load (P),

∴
τ = 150 × 103 / 4248  =  35.3 N/mm2  =  35.3 MPa
3. Failure of the single eye or rod end in tension
The single eye or rod end may fail in tension due to the load. We know that load (P),
150 × 103 = (d2 – d1) t × σt = (104 – 52) 65 × σt = 3380 σt
∴
σt = 150 × 103 / 3380 = 44.4 N / mm2  =  44.4 MPa
4. Failure of the single eye or rod end in shearing
The single eye or rod end may fail in shearing due to the load. We know that load (P),
150 × 103 = (d2 – d1) t × τ = (104 – 52) 65 × τ = 3380 τ
∴
τ = 150 × 103 / 3380 = 44.4 N/mm2  =  44.4 MPa
5. Failure of the single eye or rod end in crushing
The single eye or rod end may fail in crushing due to the load. We know that load (P),
150 × 103 = d1 × t × σc = 52 × 65  × σc = 3380 σc
∴
σc = 150 × 103 / 3380  = 44.4 N/mm2 =  44.4  MPa
6. Failure of the forked end in tension
The forked end may fail in tension due to the load. We know that load (P),
150 × 103 = (d2 – d1) 2 t1 × σt = (104 – 52) 2 × 40 × σt = 4160 σt
∴
σt = 150 × 103 / 4160  =  36 N/mm2  =  36 MPa
7. Failure of the forked end in shear
The forked end may fail in shearing due to the load. We know that load (P),
150 × 103 = (d2 – d1) 2 t1 × τ = (104 – 52) 2 × 40 × τ = 4160 τ
∴
τ = 150 × 103 / 4160 =  36 N/mm2  =  36 MPa
8. Failure of the forked end in crushing
The forked end may fail in crushing due to the load. We know that load (P),
150 × 103 = d1 × 2 t1 × σc = 52 × 2 × 40 × σc = 4160 σc
∴
σc = 150 × 103 / 4180 = 36 N/mm2  =  36 MPa
From above, we see that the induced stresses are less than the given design stresses, therefore
the joint is safe.
Example 12.8. Design a knuckle joint for a tie rod of a circular section to sustain a maximum
pull of 70 kN. The ultimate strength of the material of the rod against tearing is 420 MPa. The
ultimate tensile and shearing strength of the pin material are 510 MPa and 396 MPa respectively.
Determine the tie rod section and pin section. Take factor of safety = 6.
Solution. Given : P = 70 kN = 70 000 N ; σtu for rod = 420 MPa ; *σtu for pin = 510 MPa ;
τu = 396 MPa ;  F.S. = 6
We know that the permissible tensile stress for the rod material,

We shall now consider the various methods of failure of the joint as discussed below:

 = 55 d 2
∴
d 2 = 70 000 / 55 = 1273   or   d  =  35.7 say 36 mm  Ans.
The other dimensions of the joint are fixed as given below :
Diameter of the knuckle pin,
d1 = d  =  36 mm
Outer diameter of the eye,
d2 = 2 d  =  2 × 36  =  72 mm
Diameter of knuckle pin head and collar,
d3 = 1.5 d  =  1.5 × 36  =  54 mm
Thickness of single eye or rod end,
t = 1.25 d  =  1.25 × 36  =  45 mm
Thickness of fork,
t1 =  0.75 d  =  0.75 × 36  =  27 mm
Now we shall check for the induced streses as discussed below :
2. Failure of the knuckle pin in shear
Since the knuckle pin is in double shear, therefore load (P),
70  000 = 2 × 4
π  (d1)2 τ  =  2 × 4
π  (36)2  τ  =  2036 τ
∴
τ = 70  000 / 2036  =  34.4 N/mm2
3. Failure of the single eye or rod end in tension
The single eye or rod end may fail in tension due to the load. We know that load (P),
70  000 =  (d2 – d1) t × σt = (72 – 36) 45 σt = 1620 σt
∴
σt = 70  000 / 1620  =  43.2 N/mm2
4. Failure of the forked end in tension
The forked end may fail in tension due to the load. We know that load (P),
  70  000 = (d2 – d1) 2 t1 × σt = (72 – 36) × 2 × 27 × σt = 1944 σt
∴
      σt = 70  000 / 1944  =  36 N/mm2
From above we see that the induced stresses are less than given permissible stresses, therefore
the joint is safe.

Adjustable Screwed Joint for
Round  Rods (Turnbuckle)
Sometimes, two round tie rods, as shown in Fig.
12.18, are connected by means of a coupling known
as a turnbuckle. In this type of joint, one of the rods
has right hand threads and the other rod has left hand
threads. The rods are screwed to a coupler which has
a threaded hole. The coupler is of hexagonal or
rectangular shape in the centre and round at both the
ends in order to facilitate the rods to tighten or loosen
with the help of a spanner when required. Sometimes
Turnbuckle.

instead of a spanner, a round iron rod may be used. The iron rod is inserted in a hole in the coupler as
shown dotted in Fig. 12.18.
Fig. 12.18. Turnbuckle.
A turnbuckle commonly used in engineering practice (mostly in aeroplanes) is shown in
Fig. 12.19. This type of turnbuckle is made hollow in the middle to reduce its weight. In this case, the
two ends of the rods may also be seen. It is not necessary that the material of the rods and the
turnbuckle may be same or different. It depends upon the pull acting on the joint.
12.17  Design of Turnbuckle
Consider a turnbuckle, subjected to an axial load P, as shown in Fig. 12.19. Due to this load, the
threaded rod will be subjected to tensile stress whose magnitude is given by

Giving a margin for higher coefficient of friction, the maximum principal stress may be taken as
1.3 times the normal stress. Therefore for designing a threaded section, we shall take the design load
as 1.3 times the normal load, i.e.
Design load,
Pd = 1.3 P
The following procedure may be adopted in designing a turn-buckle :
1. Diameter of the rods
The diameter of the rods (d) may be obtained by considering the tearing of the threads of the
rods at their roots. We know that

diameter of the threads (or diameter of the rod) may be found from Table 11.1, corresponding to the
core diameter, assuming coarse threads.
2. Length of the coupler nut
The length of the coupler nut (l) is obtained by considering the shearing of the threads at their
roots in the coupler nut. We know that
Shearing resistance of the threads of the coupler nut

where
τ = Shear stress for the material of the coupler nut.
Equating the design load to the shearing resistance of the threads in the coupler nut, we have
Pd = (π dc × l ) τ
From this expression, the value of l may be calculated. In actual practice, the length of coupler
nut ( l ) is taken d to 1.25 d for steel nuts and 1.5 d to 2 d for cast iron and softer material nut. The length
of the coupler nut may also be checked for crushing of threads. We know that

rectangular to fit the spanner, it may be circumscribed over the circle of outside diameter D2.
5. The length of the coupler between the nuts (L) depends upon the amount of adjustment
required. It is usually taken as 6 d.
6. The thickness of the coupler is usually taken as t = 0.75 d, and thickness of the coupler nut,

Example 12.9. The pull in the tie rod of an iron roof truss is 50 kN. Design a suitable adjustable
screwed joint. The permissible stresses are 75 MPa in tension, 37.5 MPa in shear and 90 MPa in
crushing.
Solution. Given : P =  50 kN  =  50 × 103 N ; σt = 75 MPa = 75 N/mm2 ;  τ = 37.5 MPa = 37.5 N/mm2
We know that the design load for the threaded section,
Pd = 1.3 P = 1.3 × 50 × 103 = 65 × 103 N
An adjustable screwed joint, as shown in Fig. 12.19, is suitable for the given purpose. The
various dimensions for the joint are determined as discussed below :
1. Diameter of the tie rod
Let
d = Diameter of the tie rod, and
dc = Core diameter of threads on the tie rod.
Considering tearing of the threads on the tie rod at their roots.
We know that design load (Pd),

∴

From Table 11.1 for coarse series, we find that the standard core diameter is 34.093 mm and the
corresponding nominal diameter of the threads or diameter of tie rod,
d = 39 mm  Ans.
2. Length of the coupler nut
Let
l = Length of the coupler nut.
Considering the shearing of threads at their roots in the coupler nut. We know that design load
(Pd),
65 × 103 = (π  dc.l )  τ  =  π  ×  34.093  ×  l  ×  37.5  = 4107  l
∴
l  = 65  ×  103 / 4017  =  16.2 mm
Since the length of the coupler nut is taken from d to 1.25 d, therefore we shall take
l  =   d  =  39 mm  Ans.
We shall now check the length of the coupler nut for crushing of threads.
From Table 11.1 for coarse series, we find that the pitch of the threads is 4 mm. Therefore the
number of threads per mm length,
n = 1 / 4  = 0.25
We know that design load (Pd),
65 × 103 =

∴

Since the induced crushing stress in the threads of the coupler nut is less than the permissible
stress, therefore the design is satisfactory.

      D =   Outside diameter of the coupler nut

or

∴
D2 = 848 + (39)2 = 2369      or     D  =  48.7 say 50 mm   Ans.
Since the minimum outside diameter of coupler nut is taken as 1.25 d (i.e. 1.25 × 39 = 48.75 mm),
therefore the above value of D is satisfactory.
4. Outside diameter of the coupler
Let
D2 = Outside diameter of the coupler, and
D1 = Inside diameter of the coupler = d + 6 mm = 39 + 6 = 45 mm
Considering tearing of the coupler. We know that axial load (P),

Since the minimum outside diameter of the coupler is taken as 1.5 d (i.e. 1.5 × 39  =  58.5 say 60 mm),
therefore we shall take
D2  =  60 mm   Ans.

13.1 Introduction
A key is a piece of mild steel inserted between the
shaft and hub or boss of the pulley to connect these together
in order to prevent relative motion between them. It is
always inserted parallel to the axis of the shaft. Keys are
used as temporary fastenings and are subjected to consider-
able crushing and shearing stresses. A keyway is a slot or
recess in a shaft and hub of the pulley to accommodate a
key.
13.2 Types of Keys
The following types of keys are important from the
subject point of view :
1. Sunk keys, 2. Saddle keys, 3. Tangent keys,
4. Round keys, and 5. Splines.
We shall now discuss the above types of keys, in
detail, in the following pages.

13.3 Sunk Keys
The sunk keys are provided half in the keyway of the shaft and half in the keyway of the hub or
boss of the pulley. The sunk keys are of the following types :
1. Rectangular sunk key. A rectangular sunk key is shown in Fig. 13.1. The usual proportions
of this key are :
Width of key,
w = d / 4 ; and thickness of key,   t = 2w / 3 = d / 6
where
d = Diameter of the shaft or diameter of the hole in the hub.
The key has taper 1 in 100 on the top side only.
Fig. 13.1. Rectangular sunk key.
2. Square sunk key. The only difference
between a rectangular sunk key and a square
sunk key is that its width and thickness are
equal, i.e.
        w = t = d / 4
3. Parallel sunk key. The parallel sunk
keys may be of rectangular or square section
uniform in width and thickness throughout. It
may be noted that a parallel key is a taperless
and is used where the pulley, gear or other
mating piece is required to slide along the shaft.
4. Gib-head key. It is a rectangular sunk
key with a head at one end known as gib head.
It is usually provided to facilitate the removal
of key. A gib head key is shown in Fig. 13.2
(a) and its use in shown in Fig. 13.2 (b).
Fig. 13.2. Gib-head key.
The usual proportions of the gib head key are :
Width,
w = d / 4 ;
and thickness at large end,
t
=  2w / 3 = d / 6

5. Feather key. A key attached to one member of a pair and which permits relative axial
movement is known as feather key. It is a special type of parallel key which transmits a turning
moment and also permits axial movement. It is fastened either to the shaft or hub, the key being a
sliding fit in the key way of the moving piece.
Fig. 13.3. Feather key.
The feather key may be screwed to the shaft as shown in Fig. 13.3 (a) or it may have double gib
heads as shown in Fig. 13.3 (b). The various proportions of a feather key are same as that of
rectangular sunk key and gib head key.
The following table shows the proportions of standard parallel, tapered and gib head keys,
according to IS : 2292 and 2293-1974 (Reaffirmed 1992).

6. Woodruff key. The woodruff key is an easily adjustable key. It is a piece from a cylindrical
disc having segmental cross-section in front view as shown in Fig. 13.4. A woodruff key is capable of
tilting in a recess milled out in the shaft by a cutter having the same curvature as the disc from which
the key is made. This key is largely used in machine tool and automobile construction.

*
The usual form of rectangular sunk key is very likely to turn over in its keyway unless well fitted as its
sides.
Fig. 13.4. Woodruff key.
The main advantages of a woodruff key are as follows :
1. It accommodates itself to any taper in the hub or boss of the mating piece.
2. It is useful on tapering shaft ends. Its extra depth in the shaft *prevents any tendency to turn
over in its keyway.
The disadvantages are :
1. The depth of the keyway weakens the shaft.
2. It can not be used as a feather.
13.4 Saddle keys
The saddle keys are of the following two types :
1. Flat saddle key, and 2. Hollow saddle key.
A flat saddle key is a taper key which fits in a keyway in the hub and is flat on the shaft as shown
in Fig. 13.5. It is likely to slip round the shaft under load. Therefore it is used for comparatively light
loads.
Fig. 13.5. Saddle key.
Fig. 13.6. Tangent key.
A hollow saddle key is a taper key which fits in a keyway in the hub and the bottom of the key
is shaped to fit the curved surface of the shaft. Since hollow saddle keys hold on by friction, therefore
these are suitable for light loads. It is usually used as a temporary fastening in fixing and setting
eccentrics, cams etc.
13.5 Tangent Keys
The tangent keys are fitted in pair at right angles as shown in Fig. 13.6. Each key is to withstand
torsion in one direction only. These are used in large heavy duty shafts.

13.6 Round Keys
The round keys, as shown in Fig. 13.7(a), are circular in section and fit into holes drilled partly
in the shaft and partly in the hub. They have the advantage that their keyways may be drilled and
reamed after the mating parts have been assembled. Round keys are usually considered to be most
appropriate for low power drives.
Fig. 13.7. Round keys.
Sometimes the tapered pin, as shown in Fig. 13.7 (b), is held in place by the friction between the
pin and the reamed tapered holes.
13.7 Splines
Sometimes, keys are made integral with the shaft which fits in the
keyways broached in the hub. Such shafts are known as splined shafts
as shown in Fig. 13.8. These shafts usually have four, six, ten or sixteen
splines. The splined shafts are relatively stronger than shafts having a
single keyway.
The splined shafts are used when the force to be transmitted is
large in proportion to the size of the shaft as in automobile transmis-
sion and sliding gear transmissions. By using splined shafts, we obtain
axial movement as well as positive drive is obtained.
13.8 Forces acting on a Sunk Key
When a key is used in transmitting torque from a shaft to a rotor
or hub, the following two types of forces act on the key :
1. Forces (F1) due to fit of the key in its keyway, as in a tight fitting straight key or in a tapered
key driven in place. These forces produce compressive stresses in the key which are difficult
to determine in magnitude.
2. Forces (F) due to the torque transmitted by the shaft. These forces produce shearing and
compressive (or crushing) stresses in the key.
The distribution of the forces along the length of the key is not uniform because the forces are
concentrated near the torque-input end. The non-uniformity of distribution is caused by the twisting
of the shaft within the hub.
The forces acting on a key for a clockwise torque being transmitted from a shaft to a hub are
shown in Fig. 13.9.
In designing a key, forces due to fit of the key are neglected and it is assumed that the distribu-
tion of forces along the length of key is uniform.

13.9 Strength of a Sunk Key
A key connecting the shaft and hub is shown in Fig. 13.9.
Let
T = Torque transmitted by the shaft,
F = Tangential force acting at the circumference of the shaft,
d = Diameter of shaft,
l = Length of key,
w = Width of key.
t = Thickness of key, and
τ and σc = Shear and crushing stresses for the material of key.
A little consideration will show that due to the power transmitted by the shaft, the key may fail
due to shearing or crushing.

shaft,

Example 13.1. Design the rectangular key for a shaft of 50 mm diameter. The shearing and
crushing stresses for the key material are 42 MPa and 70 MPa.
Solution. Given : d = 50 mm ; τ = 42 MPa = 42 N/mm2 ; σc = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2
The rectangular key is designed as discussed below:
From Table 13.1, we find that for a shaft of 50 mm diameter,

Example 13.2. A 45 mm diameter shaft is made of steel with a yield strength of 400 MPa.
A parallel key of size 14 mm wide and 9 mm thick made of steel with a yield strength of 340 MPa
is to be used. Find the required length of key, if the shaft is loaded to transmit the maximum

Solution. Given :  d = 45 mm ; σyt for shaft = 400 MPa = 400 N/mm2 ; w = 14 mm ;
t = 9 mm ; σyt for key = 340 MPa = 340 N/mm2; F.S. = 2

13.10 Effect of Keyways
A little consideration will show that the keyway cut into the shaft reduces the load carrying
capacity of the shaft. This is due to the stress concentration near the corners of the keyway and
reduction in the cross-sectional area of the shaft. It other words, the torsional strength of the shaft is
reduced. The following relation for the weakening effect of the keyway is based on the experimental
results by H.F. Moore.

It is usually assumed that the strength of the keyed shaft is 75% of the solid shaft, which is
somewhat higher than the value obtained by the above relation.
In case the keyway is too long and the key is of sliding type, then the angle of twist is increased
in the ratio kθ as given by the following relation :

Example 13.3. A 15 kW, 960 r.p.m. motor has a mild steel shaft of 40 mm diameter and the
extension being 75 mm. The permissible shear and crushing stresses for the mild steel key are
56 MPa and 112 MPa. Design the keyway in the motor shaft extension. Check the shear strength of
the key against the normal strength of the shaft.
Solution. Given : P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W ; N = 960 r.p.m. ; d = 40 mm ; l = 75 mm ;
τ = 56 MPa = 56 N/mm2 ; σc = 112 MPa = 112 N/mm2

13.11 Shaft Coupling
Shafts are usually available up to 7 metres length due to inconvenience in transport. In order to
have a greater length, it becomes necessary to join two or more pieces of the shaft by means of a
coupling.

Keys and Coupling     479
Shaft couplings are used in machinery for several purposes, the most common of which are the
following :
1. To provide for the connection of
shafts of units that are manufactured
separately such as a motor and gen-
erator and to provide for disconnec-
tion for repairs or alternations.
2. To provide for misalignment of the
shafts or to introduce mechanical
flexibility.
3. To reduce the transmission of shock
loads from one shaft to another.
4. To introduce protection against
overloads.
5. It should have no projecting parts.
Note : A coupling is termed as a device used to make permanent or semi-permanent connection where as a
clutch permits rapid connection or disconnection at the will of the operator.
13.12 Requirements of a Good Shaft Coupling
A good shaft coupling should have the following requirements :
1. It should be easy to connect or disconnect.
2. It should transmit the full power from one shaft to the other shaft without losses.
3. It should hold the shafts in perfect alignment.
4. It should reduce the transmission of shock loads from
one shaft to another shaft.
5. It should have no projecting parts.
13.13 Types of Shafts Couplings
Shaft couplings are divided into two main groups as fol-
lows :
1. Rigid coupling. It is used to connect two shafts which
are perfectly aligned. Following types of rigid coupling are
important from the subject point of view :
(a) Sleeve or muff coupling.
(b) Clamp or split-muff or compression coupling, and
(c) Flange coupling.
2. Flexible coupling. It is used to connect two shafts
having both lateral and angular misalignment. Following types
of flexible coupling are important from the subject point of
view :
(a) Bushed pin type coupling,
(b) Universal coupling, and
(c) Oldham coupling.
We shall now discuss the above types of couplings, in
detail, in the following pages.

13.14 Sleeve or Muff-coupling
It is the simplest type of rigid coupling, made of cast iron. It consists of a hollow cylinder whose
inner diameter is the same as that of the shaft. It is fitted over the ends of the two shafts by means of
a gib head key, as shown in Fig. 13.10. The power is transmitted from one shaft to the other shaft by
means of a key and a sleeve. It is, therefore, necessary that all the elements must be strong enough to
transmit the torque. The usual proportions of a cast iron sleeve coupling are as follows :
Outer diameter of the sleeve,
D = 2d + 13 mm
and length of the sleeve,
L = 3.5 d
where d is the diameter of the shaft.
In designing a sleeve or muff-coupling, the following procedure may be adopted.
1. Design for sleeve
The sleeve is designed by considering it as a hollow shaft.
Fig. 13.10. Sleeve or muff coupling.
Let
T = Torque to be transmitted by the coupling, and
τc = Permissible shear stress for the material of the sleeve which is cast rion.
The safe value of shear stress for cast iron may be taken as 14 MPa.
We know that torque transmitted by a hollow section,

2. Design for key
The key for the coupling may be designed in the similar way as discussed in Art. 13.9. The

Note: The depth of the keyway in each of the shafts to be connected should be exactly the same and the
diameters should also be same. If these conditions are not satisfied, then the key will be bedded on one shaft
while in the other it will be loose. In order to prevent this, the key is made in two parts which may be driven from
the same end for each shaft or they may be driven from opposite ends.
Example 13.4. Design and make a neat dimensioned sketch of a muff coupling which is used to
connect two steel shafts transmitting 40 kW at 350 r.p.m. The material for the shafts and key is plain
carbon steel for which allowable shear and crushing stresses may be taken as 40 MPa and 80 MPa
respectively. The material for the muff is cast iron for which the allowable shear stress may be
assumed as 15 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 40 kW = 40 × 103 W;
N = 350 r.p.m.; τs = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2; σcs = 80 MPa =
80 N/mm2; τc = 15 MPa = 15 N/mm2
The muff coupling is shown in Fig. 13.10. It is
designed as discussed below :
1. Design for shaft

∴         d3
= 1100 × 103/7.86 = 140 × 103 or d = 52 say 55 mm Ans.
2.  Design for sleeve
We know that outer diameter of the muff,
D = 2d + 13 mm = 2 × 55 + 13 = 123 say 125 mm Ans.
and length of the muff,
L = 3.5 d = 3.5 × 55 = 192.5 say 195 mm Ans.
Let us now check the induced shear stress in the muff. Let τc be the induced shear stress in the
muff which is made of cast iron. Since the muff is considered to be a hollow shaft, therefore the torque
transmitted (T),
1100 × 103 =

Since the induced shear stress in the muff (cast iron) is less than the permissible shear stress of
15 N/mm2, therefore the design of muff is safe.
3. Design for key
From Table 13.1, we find that for a shaft of 55 mm diameter,
Width of key, w = 18 mm Ans.
Since the crushing stress for the key material is twice the shearing stress, therefore a square key
may be used.

Let us now check the induced shear and crushing stresses in the key. First of all, let us consider
shearing of the key. We know that torque transmitted (T),

Since the induced shear and crushing stresses
are less than the permissible stresses, therefore the
design of key is safe.
13.15 Clamp or Compression
Coupling
It is also known as split muff coupling. In
this case, the muff or sleeve is made into two halves
and are bolted together as shown in Fig. 13.11. The
halves of the muff are made of cast iron. The shaft
ends are made to abutt each other and a single key
is fitted directly in the keyways of both the shafts.
One-half of the muff is fixed from below and the
other half is placed from above. Both the halves are
held together by means of mild steel studs or bolts
and nuts. The number of bolts may be two, four or six. The nuts are recessed into the bodies of the
muff castings. This coupling may be used for heavy duty and moderate speeds. The advantage of this
coupling is that the position of the shafts need not be changed for assembling or disassembling of the
(a) Heavy duty flex-flex coupling.
(b) Heavy duty flex-rigid coupling.
Spilt-sleeve coupling.

where

Fig. 13.11. Clamp or compression coupling.
In the clamp or compression coupling, the power is transmitted from one shaft to the other by
means of key and the friction between the muff and shaft. In designing this type of coupling, the
following procedure may be adopted.
1.  Design of muff and key
The muff and key are designed in the similar way as discussed in muff coupling (Art. 13.14).

Let
T = Torque transmited by the shaft,

stress for the shaft and key is 40 MPa and the number of bolts connecting the two halves are six. The
permissible tensile stress for the bolts is 70 MPa. The coefficient of friction between the muff and the
shaft surface may be taken as 0.3.
Solution. Given : P = 30 kW = 30 × 103 W ; N = 100 r.p.m. ; τ = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2 ;
n = 6 ; σt = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2 ; μ = 0.3

2. Design for muff
We know that diameter of muff,
D = 2d + 13 mm = 2 × 75 + 13 = 163 say 165 mm Ans.
and total length of the muff,
            L = 3.5 d = 3.5 × 75 = 262.5 mm Ans.
3. Design for key
The width and thickness of the key for a shaft diameter of 75 mm (from Table 13.1) are as
follows :
Width of key,
w = 22 mm Ans.
Thickness of key,
t = 14 mm Ans.

From Table 11.1, we find that the standard core diameter of the bolt for coarse series is
23.32 mm and the nominal diameter of the bolt is 27 mm (M 27). Ans.
13.16 Flange Coupling
A flange coupling usually applies to a coupling having two separate cast iron flanges. Each
flange is mounted on the shaft end and keyed to it. The faces are turned up at right angle to the axis of
the shaft. One of the flange has a projected portion and the other flange has a corresponding recess.

Fig. 13.12. Unprotected type flange coupling.
This helps to bring the shafts into line
and to maintain alignment. The two
flanges are coupled together by
means of bolts and nuts. The flange
coupling is adopted to heavy loads
and hence it is used on large shaft-
ing. The flange couplings are of the
following three types :
1. Unprotected type flange
coupling. In an unprotected type
flange coupling, as shown in Fig.
13.12, each shaft is keyed to the boss
of a flange with a counter sunk key
and the flanges are coupled together
by means of bolts. Generally, three,
four or six bolts are used. The keys
are staggered at right angle along the
circumference of the shafts in order
to divide the weakening effect caused
by keyways.
The usual proportions for an unprotected type cast iron flange couplings, as shown in
Fig. 13.12, are as follows :
If d is the diameter of the shaft or inner diameter of the hub, then
Outside diameter of hub,

Thickness of flange,
tf = 0.5 d
Number of bolts
= 3, for d upto 40 mm
= 4, for d upto 100 mm
= 6, for d upto 180 mm
2. Protected type flange coupling. In a protected type flange coupling, as shown in Fig. 13.13,
the protruding bolts and nuts are protected by flanges on the two halves of the coupling, in order to
avoid danger to the workman.
Fig. 13.13. Protective type flange coupling.
The thickness of the protective circumferential flange (tp) is taken as 0.25 d. The other proportions
of the coupling are same as for unprotected type flange coupling.
3. Marine type flange coupling. In a marine type flange coupling, the flanges are forged integral
with the shafts as shown in Fig. 13.14. The flanges are held together by means of tapered headless
bolts, numbering from four to twelve depending upon the diameter of shaft.
The number of bolts may be choosen from the following table.

13.17 Design of Flange Coupling
Consider a flange coupling as shown in Fig. 13.12 and Fig. 13.13.
Let
d = Diameter of shaft or inner diameter of hub,
D = Outer diameter of hub,
d1 = Nominal or outside diameter of bolt,
D1 = Diameter of bolt circle,
n = Number of bolts,
tf = Thickness of flange,
τs, τb and τk = Allowable shear stress for shaft, bolt and key material respectively
τc = Allowable shear stress for the flange material i.e. cast iron,
σcb, and σck = Allowable crushing stress for bolt and key material respectively.
The flange coupling is designed as discussed below :
1. Design for hub
The hub is designed by considering it as a hollow shaft, transmitting the same torque (T) as that
of a solid shaft.

The outer diameter of hub is usually taken as twice the diameter of shaft. Therefore from the

The material of key is usually the same as that of shaft. The length of key is taken equal to the length

4. Design for bolts
The bolts are subjected to shear stress due to the torque transmitted. The number of bolts (n)
depends upon the diameter of shaft and the pitch circle diameter of bolts (D1) is taken as 3 d. We

From this equation, the induced crushing stress in the bolts may be checked.
Example 13.6. Design a cast iron protective type flange coupling to transmit 15 kW at 900
r.p.m. from an electric motor to a compressor. The service factor may be assumed as 1.35. The
following permissible stresses may be used :
Shear stress for shaft, bolt and key material
=
40 MPa
Crushing stress for bolt and key
=
80 MPa
Shear stress for cast iron
=
8 MPa
Draw a neat sketch of the coupling.
Solution. Given : P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W ; N = 900 r.p.m. ;  Service factor = 1.35 ; τs = τb
= τk = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2 ;  σcb = σck = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; τc = 8 MPa = 8 N/mm2
The protective type flange coupling is designed as discussed below :

Since the service factor is 1.35, therefore the maximum torque transmitted by the shaft,

and length of hub,
L = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 35 = 52.5 mm Ans.
Let us now check the induced shear stress for the hub material which is cast iron. Considering

Since the induced shear stress for the hub material (i.e. cast iron) is less than the permissible
value of 8 MPa, therefore the design of hub is safe.
2. Design for key
Since the crushing stress for the key material is twice its shear stress (i.e. σck = 2τk ), therefore a
square key may be used. From Table 13.1, we find that for a shaft of 35 mm diameter,
Width of key,
w = 12 mm Ans.
and thickness of key,
t = w = 12 mm Ans.
The length of key ( l ) is taken equal to the length of hub.
∴
l = L = 52.5 mm Ans.
Let us now check the induced stresses in the key by considering it in shearing and crushing.

Since the induced shear and crushing stresses in the key are less than the permissible stresses,
therefore the design for key is safe.
3. Design for flange
The thickness of flange (tf) is taken as 0.5 d.
∴
tf = 0.5 d = 0.5 × 35 = 17.5 mm Ans.
Let us now check the induced shearing stress in the flange by considering the flange at the
junction of the hub in shear.

Since the induced shear stress in the flange is less than 8 MPa, therefore the design of flange is
safe.
4. Design for bolts
Let
d1 = Nominal diameter of bolts.
Since the diameter of the shaft is 35 mm, therefore let us take the number of bolts,
n = 3
and pitch circle diameter of bolts,
D1 = 3d = 3 × 35 = 105 mm
The bolts are subjected to shear stress due to the torque transmitted. We know that the

Assuming coarse threads, the nearest standard size of bolt is M 8. Ans.
Other proportions of the flange are taken as follows :
Outer diameter of the flange,
D2 = 4 d = 4 × 35 = 140 mm Ans.
Thickness of the protective circumferential flange,
tp = 0.25 d = 0.25 × 35 = 8.75 say 10 mm Ans.
Example 13.7. Design and draw a protective type of cast iron flange coupling for a steel shaft
transmitting 15 kW at 200 r.p.m. and having an allowable shear stress of 40 MPa. The working stress
in the bolts should not exceed 30 MPa. Assume that the same material is used for shaft and key and
that the crushing stress is twice the value of its shear stress. The maximum torque is 25% greater than
the full load torque. The shear stress for cast iron is 14 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W ; N = 200 r.p.m. ; τs = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2 ;
τb = 30 MPa = 30 N/mm2 ;  σck = 2τk ; Tmax = 1.25 Tmean ;  τc = 14 MPa = 14 N/mm2

Since the induced shear stress in the hub is less than the permissible value of 14 MPa, therefore
the design for hub is safe.
2. Design for key
Since the crushing stress for the key material is twice its shear stress, therefore a square key may
be used.

90 kW at 250 r.p.m. The allowable shear stress in the shaft is 40 MPa and the angle of twist is not to
exceed 1° in a length of 20 diameters. The allowable shear stress in the coupling bolts is 30 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 90 kW = 90 × 103 W ; N = 250  r.p.m. ; τs = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2 ;
θ = 1° = π / 180 = 0.0175 rad ; τb = 30 MPa = 30 N/mm2

Assuming coarse threads, the standard nominal diameter of bolt is 18 mm. Ans.
The other proportions are taken as follows :
Outer diameter of the flange,
D2 = 4 d = 4 × 80 = 320 mm Ans.
Thickness of protective circumferential flange,

Example 13.9. Design a rigid flange coupling to transmit a torque of 250 N-m between two co-
axial shafts. The shaft is made of alloy steel, flanges out of cast iron and bolts out of steel. Four bolts
are used to couple the flanges. The shafts are keyed to the flange hub. The permissible stresses are
given below:

τs = 286 × 106 / 14.14 × 106 = 20.2 N/mm2 = 20.2 MPa
Since the induced shear stress in the *flange is less than the permissible shear stress of 60 MPa,
therefore the thickness of flange (tf = 100 mm) is safe.
4. Diameter of flange
The diameter of flange (D2) is taken as 2.2 d.
∴
D2 = 2.2 d = 2.2 × 300 = 660 mm Ans.
13.18 Flexible Coupling
We have already discussed that a flexible coupling is used to join the abutting ends of shafts
when they are not in exact alignment. In the case of a direct coupled drive from a prime mover to an
electric generator, we should have four bearings at a comparatively close distance. In such a case and
in many others, as in a direct electric drive from an electric motor to a machine tool, a flexible
coupling is used so as to permit an axial misalignemnt of the shaft without undue absorption of the
power which the shaft are transmitting. Following are the different types of flexible couplings :
1. Bushed pin flexible coupling, 2. Oldham's coupling, and 3. Universal coupling.
We shall now discuss these types of couplings, in detail, in the following articles.

13.19 Bushed-pin Flexible Coupling
Fig. 13.15. Bushed-pin flexible coupling.
A bushed-pin flexible coupling, as shown in Fig. 13.15, is a modification of the rigid type of
flange coupling. The coupling bolts are known as pins. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the
pins. The two halves of the coupling are dissimilar in construction. A clearance of 5 mm is left
between the face of the two halves of the coupling. There is no rigid connection between them and the
drive takes place through the medium of the compressible rubber or leather bushes.
In designing the bushed-pin flexible coupling, the proportions of the rigid type flange coupling
are modified. The main modification is to reduce the bearing pressure on the rubber or leather bushes
and it should not exceed 0.5 N/mm2. In order to keep the low bearing pressure, the pitch circle
diameter and the pin size is increased.
Let
l = Length of bush in the flange,
d2 = Diameter of bush,
pb = Bearing pressure on the bush or pin,
n = Number of pins, and
D1 = Diameter of pitch circle of the pins.
We know that bearing load acting on each pin,
W = pb × d2 × l
∴ Total bearing load on the bush or pins
= W × n = pb × d2 × l × n

Example 13.12. Design a bushed-pin type of flexible coupling to connect a pump shaft to a
motor shaft transmitting 32 kW at 960 r.p.m. The overall torque is 20 percent more than mean torque.
The material properties are as follows :
(a)
The allowable shear and crushing stress for shaft and key material is 40 MPa and
80 MPa respectively.
(b)
The allowable shear stress for cast iron is 15 MPa.
(c)
The allowable bearing pressure for rubber bush is 0.8 N/mm2.
(d)

Solution. Given : P = 32 kW = 32 × 103 W ; N = 960 r.p.m. ; Tmax = 1.2 Tmean ; τs = τk = 40 MPa
= 40 N/mm2 ; σcs = σck = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; τc = 15 MPa = 15 N/mm2 ; pb = 0.8 N/mm2
The bushed-pin flexible coupling is designed as discussed below :
1.  Design for pins and rubber bush

We have discussed in rigid type of flange coupling that the number of bolts for 40 mm diameter
shaft are 3. In the flexible coupling, we shall use the number of pins (n) as 6.

In order to allow for the bending stress induced due to the compressibility of the rubber bush,
the diameter of the pin (d1) may be taken as 20 mm. Ans.
The length of the pin of least diameter i.e. d1 = 20 mm is threaded and secured in the right hand
coupling half by a standard nut and washer. The enlarged portion of the pin which is in the left hand
coupling half is made of 24 mm diameter. On the enlarged portion, a brass bush of thickness 2 mm is
pressed. A brass bush carries a rubber bush. Assume the thickness of rubber bush as 6 mm.
∴Overall diameter of rubber bush,

Let
l

We know that the outer diameter of the hub,

and length of hub,
L = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 40 = 60 mm
Let us now check the induced shear stress for the hub material which is cast iron. Considering

∴
τc = 382 × 103 / 94.26 × 103 = 4.05 N/mm2 = 4.05 MPa
Since the induced shear stress for the hub material (i.e. cast iron) is less than the permissible
value of 15 MPa, therefore the design of hub is safe.
3. Design for key
Since the crushing stress for the key material is twice its shear stress (i.e. σck = 2 τk ), therefore
a square key may be used. From Table 13.1, we find that for a shaft of 40 mm diameter,
Width of key,
w = 14 mm Ans.
and thickness of key,t = w = 14 mm Ans.
The length of key (L) is taken equal to the length of hub, i.e.
L = 1.5 d = 1.5 × 40 = 60 mm
Let us now check the induced stresses in the key by considering it in shearing and crushing.
Considering the key in shearing. We know that the maximum torque transmitted (Tmax),

Since the induced shear and crushing stress in the key are less than the permissible stresses of
40 MPa and 80 MPa respectively, therefore the design for key is safe.
4. Design for flange
The thickness of flange ( tf ) is taken as 0.5 d.
∴
tf = 0.5 d = 0.5 × 40 = 20 mm
Let us now check the induced shear stress in the flange by considering the flange at the junction
of the hub in shear.

of flange is safe.
13.20 Oldham Coupling
It is used to join two shafts which have lateral mis-alignment. It consists of two flanges A and B
with slots and a central floating part E with two tongues T1 and T2 at right angles as shown in
Fig. 13.17. The central floating part is held by means of a pin passing through the flanges and the floating
part. The tongue T1 fits into the slot of flange A and allows for ‘to and fro’ relative motion of the
shafts, while the tongue T2 fits into the slot of the flange B and allows for vertical relative motion of
the parts. The resultant of these two components of motion will accommodate lateral misalignment of
the shaft as they rotate.

13.21 Universal (or Hooke’s) Coupling
A universal or Hooke’s coupling is used to connect two shafts whose axes intersect at a small
angle. The inclination of the two shafts may be constant, but in actual practice, it varies when the
motion is transmitted from one shaft to another. The main application of the universal or Hooke’s
coupling is found in the transmission from the gear box to the differential or back axle of the
automobiles. In such a case, we use two Hooke’s coupling, one at each end of the propeller shaft,
connecting the gear box at one end and the differential on the other end. A Hooke’s coupling is also
used for transmission of power to different spindles of multiple drilling machine. It is used as a knee
joint in milling machines.
In designing a universal coupling, the shaft diameter and the pin diameter is obtained as
discussed below. The other dimensions of the coupling are fixed by proportions as shown in Fig.
13.18.
Let
d = Diameter of shaft,
dp = Diameter of pin, and

From above we see that for a single Hooke’s coupling, the speed of the driven shaft is not constant
but varies from maximum to minimum. In order to have constant velocity ratio of the driving and driven
shafts, an intermediate shaft with a Hooke’s coupling at each end (known as double Hooke’s coupling) is
used.
Example 13.13. An universal coupling is used to connect two mild steel shafts transmitting a
torque of 5000 N-m. Assuming that the shafts are subjected to torsion only, find the diameter of the
shafts and pins. The allowable shear stresses for the shaft and pin may be taken as 60 MPa and
28 MPa respectively.

14.1 Introduction
A shaft is a rotating machine element which is used
to transmit power from one place to another. The power is
delivered to the shaft by some tangential force and the
resultant torque (or twisting moment) set up within the shaft
permits the power to be transferred to various machines
linked up to the shaft. In order to transfer the power from
one shaft to another, the various members such as pulleys,
gears etc., are mounted on it. These members along with
the forces exerted upon them causes the shaft to bending.
In other words, we may say that a shaft is used for the
transmission of torque and bending moment. The various
members are mounted on the shaft by means of keys or
splines.
Notes: 1. The shafts are usually cylindrical, but may be square or
cross-shaped in section. They are solid in cross-section but
sometimes hollow shafts are also used.

2. An axle, though similar in shape to the shaft, is a stationary machine element and is used for the
transmission of bending moment only. It simply acts as a support for some rotating body such as hoisting drum,
a car wheel or a rope sheave.
3. A spindle is a short shaft that imparts motion either to a cutting tool (e.g. drill press spindles) or to a
work piece (e.g. lathe spindles).
14.2 Material Used for Shafts
The material used for shafts should have the following properties :
1. It should have high strength.
2. It should have good machinability.
3. It should have low notch sensitivity factor.
4. It should have good heat treatment properties.
5. It should have high wear resistant properties.
The material used for ordinary shafts is carbon steel of grades 40 C 8, 45 C 8, 50 C 4 and 50 C 12.
The mechanical properties of these grades of carbon steel are given in the following table.
Table 14.1. Mechanical properties of steels used for shafts.

When a shaft of high strength is required, then an alloy steel such as nickel, nickel-chromium or
chrome-vanadium steel is used.
14.3 Manufacturing of Shafts
Shafts are generally manufactured by hot rolling and finished to size by cold drawing or turning
and grinding. The cold rolled shafts are stronger than hot rolled shafts but with higher residual stresses.
The residual stresses may cause distortion of the shaft when it is machined, especially when slots or
keyways are cut. Shafts of larger diameter are usually forged and turned to size in a lathe.
14.4 Types of Shafts
The following two types of shafts are important from the subject point of view :
1. Transmission shafts. These shafts transmit power between the source and the machines
absorbing power. The counter shafts, line shafts, over head shafts and all factory shafts are transmission
shafts. Since these shafts carry machine parts such as pulleys, gears etc., therefore they are subjected
to bending in addition to twisting.
2. Machine shafts. These shafts form an integral part of the machine itself. The crank shaft is
an example of machine shaft.
14.5 Standard Sizes of Transmission Shafts
The standard sizes of transmission shafts are :
25 mm to 60 mm with 5 mm steps; 60 mm to 110 mm with 10 mm steps ; 110 mm to 140 mm
with 15 mm steps ; and 140 mm to 500 mm with 20 mm steps.
The standard length of the shafts are 5 m, 6 m and 7 m.

Shafts     511
14.6 Stresses in Shafts
The following stresses are induced in the shafts :
1. Shear stresses due to the transmission of torque (i.e. due to torsional load).
2. Bending stresses (tensile or compressive) due to the forces acting upon machine elements
like gears, pulleys etc. as well as due to the weight of the shaft itself.
3. Stresses due to combined torsional and bending loads.
14.7 Maximum Permissible Working Stresses for Transmission Shafts
According to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code for the design of
transmission shafts, the maximum permissible working stresses in tension or compression may be
taken as
(a) 112 MPa for shafts without allowance for keyways.
(b) 84 MPa for shafts with allowance for keyways.
For shafts purchased under definite physical specifications, the permissible tensile stress (σt)
may be taken as 60 per cent of the elastic limit in tension (σel), but not more than 36 per cent of the
ultimate tensile strength (σu). In other words, the permissible tensile stress,
σt = 0.6 σel  or  0.36 σu, whichever is less.
The maximum permissible shear stress may be taken as
(a)
56 MPa for shafts without allowance for key ways.
(b)
42 MPa for shafts with allowance for keyways.
For shafts purchased under definite physical specifications, the permissible shear stress (τ) may
be taken as 30 per cent of the elastic limit in tension (σel) but not more than 18 per cent of the ultimate
tensile strength (σu). In other words, the permissible shear stress,
τ = 0.3 σel  or  0.18 σu, whichever is less.
14.8 Design of Shafts
The shafts may be designed on the basis of
1. Strength, and  2.  Rigidity and stiffness.
In designing shafts on the basis of strength, the following cases may be considered :
(a)
Shafts subjected to twisting moment or torque only,
(b)
Shafts subjected to bending moment only,
(c)
Shafts subjected to combined twisting and bending moments, and
(d)
Shafts subjected to axial loads in addition to combined torsional and bending loads.
We shall now discuss the above cases, in detail, in the following pages.
14.9 Shafts Subjected to Twisting Moment Only
When the shaft is subjected to a twisting moment (or torque) only, then the diameter of the shaft
may be obtained by using the torsion equation. We know that
T
J
= r
τ
...(i)
where
T = Twisting moment (or torque) acting upon the shaft,
J = Polar moment of inertia of the shaft about the axis of rotation,
τ = Torsional shear stress, and
Contents

r = Distance from neutral axis to the outer most fibre
= d / 2; where d is the diameter of the shaft.
We know that for round solid shaft, polar moment of inertia,

Shafts     513
From the equations (iii) or (iv), the outside and inside diameter of a hollow shaft may be
determined.
It may be noted that
1. The hollow shafts are usually used in marine work. These shafts are stronger per kg of
material and they may be forged on a mandrel, thus making the material more homogeneous than
would be possible for a solid shaft.
When a hollow shaft is to be made equal in strength to a solid shaft, the twisting moment of both
the shafts must be same. In other words, for the same material of both the shafts,
T =

2. The twisting moment (T) may be obtained by using the following relation :

P = 2

  or   T =

P
N

π
where
T = Twisting moment in N-m, and
N = Speed of the shaft in r.p.m.
3. In case of belt drives, the twisting moment ( T ) is given by
T = (T1 – T2 ) R
where
T1 and T2 = Tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt respectively, and
R = Radius of the pulley.
Example 14.1. A line shaft rotating at 200 r.p.m. is to transmit 20 kW. The shaft may be assumed
to be made of mild steel with an allowable shear stress of 42 MPa. Determine the diameter of the
shaft, neglecting the bending moment on the shaft.
Solution. Given : N = 200 r.p.m. ; P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W; τ = 42 MPa = 42 N/mm2
Let
d = Diameter of the shaft.

∴
d3 = 955 × 103 / 8.25 = 115 733  or  d = 48.7 say 50 mm Ans.
Example 14.2. A solid shaft is transmitting 1 MW at 240 r.p.m. Determine the diameter of the
shaft if the maximum torque transmitted exceeds the mean torque by 20%. Take the maximum allowable
shear stress as 60 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 1 MW = 1 × 106 W ; N = 240 r.p.m. ; Tmax = 1.2 Tmean ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2
Let
d = Diameter of the shaft.

∴
d 3 = 47 741 × 103 / 11.78 = 4053 × 103
or
d = 159.4 say 160 mm Ans.
Example 14.3. Find the diameter of a solid steel shaft to transmit 20 kW at 200 r.p.m. The
ultimate shear stress for the steel may be taken as 360 MPa and a factor of safety as 8.
If a hollow shaft is to be used in place of the solid shaft, find the inside and outside diameter
when the ratio of inside to outside diameters is 0.5.
Solution. Given : P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W ; N = 200 r.p.m. ; τu = 360 MPa = 360 N/mm2 ;
F.S. = 8 ; k = di / do = 0.5

Example 14.4. A pair of wheels of a railway wagon carries a load of 50 kN on each axle box,
acting at a distance of 100 mm outside the wheel base. The gauge of the rails is 1.4 m. Find the
diameter of the axle between the wheels, if the stress is not to exceed 100 MPa.
Solution. Given : W = 50 kN = 50 × 103 N ; L = 100 mm ; x = 1.4 m ; σb = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2
Fig. 14.1
The axle with wheels is shown in Fig. 14.1.
A little consideration will show that the maximum bending moment acts on the wheels at C and
D. Therefore maximum bending moment,
*M = W.L = 50 × 103 × 100 = 5 × 106 N-mm
Let
d = Diameter of the axle.

14.11 Shafts Subjected to Combined Twisting Moment and Bending Moment
When the shaft is subjected to combined twisting moment and bending moment, then the shaft
must be designed on the basis of the two moments simultaneously. Various theories have been sug-
gested to account for the elastic failure of the materials when they are subjected to various types of
combined stresses. The following two theories are important from the subject point of view :
1. Maximum shear stress theory or Guest's theory. It is used for ductile materials such as mild
steel.
2. Maximum normal stress theory or Rankine’s theory. It is used for brittle materials such as
cast iron.
Let
τ = Shear stress  induced due to twisting moment, and
σb = Bending stress (tensile or compressive) induced due to bending
moment.
According to maximum shear stress theory, the maximum shear stress in the shaft,
τmax =

2. It is suggested that diameter of the shaft may be obtained by using both the theories and the larger of the
two values is adopted.
Example 14.5. A solid circular shaft is subjected to a bending moment of 3000 N-m and a
torque of 10 000 N-m. The shaft is made of 45 C 8 steel having ultimate tensile stress of 700 MPa and
a ultimate shear stress of 500 MPa. Assuming a factor of safety as 6, determine the diameter of the
shaft.

Solution. Given : M = 3000 N-m = 3 × 106 N-mm ; T = 10 000 N-m = 10 × 106 N-mm ;
σtu = 700 MPa = 700 N/mm2 ; τu = 500 MPa = 500 N/mm2

Example 14.6. A shaft supported at the ends in ball bearings carries a straight tooth spur gear
at its mid span and is to transmit 7.5 kW at 300 r.p.m. The pitch circle diameter of the gear is 150 mm.
The distances between the centre line of bearings and gear are 100 mm each. If the shaft is made of
steel and the allowable shear stress is 45 MPa, determine the diameter of the shaft. Show in a sketch
how the gear will be mounted on the shaft; also indicate the ends where the bearings will be mounted?
The pressure angle of the gear may be taken as 20°.
Solution. Given : P = 7.5 kW = 7500 W ; N = 300 r.p.m. ; D = 150 mm = 0.15 m ;
L = 200 mm = 0.2 m ; τ = 45 MPa = 45 N/mm2 ; α = 20°

Example 14.7. A shaft made of mild steel is required to transmit 100 kW at 300 r.p.m. The
supported length of the shaft is 3 metres. It carries two pulleys each weighing 1500 N supported at a
distance of 1 metre from the ends respectively. Assuming the safe value of stress, determine the
diameter of the shaft.
Solution. Given : P = 100 kW = 100 × 103 W ; N = 300 r.p.m. ; L = 3 m ; W = 1500 N

The shaft carrying the two pulleys is like a simply

at each support will be 1500 N, i.e.
RA = RB = 1500 N
A little consideration will show that the
maximum bending moment lies at each pulley i.e. at
C and D.
∴Maximum bending moment,

Example 14.8. A line shaft is driven by means of a motor placed vertically below it. The pulley
on the line shaft is 1.5 metre in diameter and has belt tensions 5.4 kN and 1.8 kN on the tight side and
slack side of the belt respectively. Both these tensions may be assumed to be vertical. If the pulley be

overhang from the shaft, the distance of the centre line of the pulley from the centre line of the
bearing being 400 mm, find the diameter of the shaft. Assuming maximum allowable shear stress of
42 MPa.
Solution . Given : D = 1.5 m or R = 0.75 m; T1 = 5.4 kN = 5400 N ; T2 = 1.8 kN = 1800 N ;
L = 400 mm ; τ = 42 MPa = 42 N/mm2
A line shaft with a pulley is shown in Fig 14.4.
We know that torque transmitted by the shaft,
T = (T1 – T2) R = (5400 – 1800) 0.75 = 2700 N-m
= 2700 × 103 N-mm
Fig. 14.4
Neglecting the weight of shaft, total vertical load acting on the pulley,
W = T1 + T2 = 5400 + 1800 = 7200 N
∴ Bending moment,
M = W × L = 7200 × 400 = 2880 × 103 N-mm

Example 14.9. A shaft is supported by two bearings placed 1 m apart. A 600 mm diameter
pulley is mounted at a distance of 300 mm to the right of left hand bearing and this drives a pulley
directly below it with the help of belt having maximum tension of 2.25 kN. Another pulley 400 mm
diameter is placed 200 mm to the left of right hand bearing and is driven with the help of electric
motor and belt, which is placed horizontally to the right. The angle of contact for both the pulleys is
180° and μ = 0.24. Determine the suitable diameter for a solid shaft, allowing working stress of
63 MPa in tension and 42 MPa in shear for the material of shaft. Assume that the torque on one
pulley is equal to that on the other pulley.
Solution. Given : AB = 1 m ; DC = 600 mm or RC = 300 mm = 0.3 m ; AC = 300 mm = 0.3 m ;
T1 = 2.25 kN = 2250 N ; DD = 400 mm or RD = 200 mm = 0.2 m ; BD = 200 mm = 0.2 m ;
θ = 180° = π rad ; μ = 0.24 ; σb = 63 MPa = 63 N/mm2 ; τ = 42 MPa = 42 N/mm2
The space diagram of the shaft is shown in Fig. 14.5 (a).
Let
T1 = Tension in the tight side of the belt on pulley C = 2250 N
...(Given)
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the belt on pulley C.

The vertical load diagram is shown in Fig. 14.5 (c).

The torque diagram is shown in Fig. 14.5 (b).
Let
T3 = Tension in the tight side of the belt on pulley D, and
T4 = Tension in the slack side of the belt on pulley D.
Since the torque on both the pulleys (i.e. C and D) is same, therefore

WD = T3 + T4 = 3376 + 1588 = 4964 N

First of all, considering the vertical loading at C. Let RAV and RBV be the reactions at the bearings
A and B respectively. We know that
RAV + RBV = 3308 N
Taking moments about A,
RBV  × 1 = 3308 × 0.3  or  RBV = 992.4 N
and
RAV = 3308 – 992.4 = 2315.6 N
We know that B.M. at A and B,
MAV = MBV = 0
B.M. at C,
MCV = RAV × 0.3 = 2315.6 × 0.3 = 694.7 N-m
B.M. at D,
MDV = RBV × 0.2 = 992.4 × 0.2 = 198.5 N-m

Now considering horizontal loading at D. Let RAH and RBH be the reactions at the bearings A and
B respectively. We know that
RAH + RBH = 4964 N
Taking moments about A,
RBH × 1 = 4964 × 0.8   or   RBH = 3971 N
and
RAH = 4964 – 3971 = 993 N
We know that B.M. at A and B,
MAH = MBH = 0
B.M. at C,
MCH = RAH × 0.3 = 993 × 0.3 = 297.9 N-m
B.M. at D,
MDH = RBH × 0.2 = 3971 × 0.2 = 794.2 N-m

Example 14.10. A shaft is supported on bearings A and B, 800 mm between centres. A 20°
straight tooth spur gear having 600 mm pitch diameter, is located 200 mm to the right of the left hand
bearing A, and a 700 mm diameter pulley is mounted 250 mm towards the left of bearing B. The gear
is driven by a pinion with a downward tangential force while the pulley drives a horizontal belt
having 180° angle of wrap. The pulley also serves as a flywheel and weighs 2000 N. The maximum
belt tension is 3000 N and the tension ratio is 3 : 1. Determine the maximum bending moment and the
necessary shaft diameter if the allowable shear stress of the material is 40 MPa.
Solution. Given : AB = 800 mm ; αC = 20° ; DC = 600 mm or RC = 300 mm ; AC = 200 mm ;

The vertical and horizontal load diagram at C and D is shown in Fig. 14.6 (c) and (d)
respectively.
Now let us find the maximum bending moment for vertical and horizontal loading.
First of all considering the vertical loading at C and D. Let RAV and RBV be the reactions at the
bearings A and B respectively. We know that
RAV + RBV = 2333 + 2000 = 4333 N
Taking moments about A, we get
RBV × 800 = 2000 (800 – 250) + 2333 × 200
= 1 566 600
∴
RBV = 1 566 600 / 800 = 1958 N
and
RAV = 4333 – 1958 = 2375 N
We know that B.M. at A and B,
MAV = MBV = 0
B.M. at C,
MCV = RAV × 200 = 2375 × 200
= 475 × 103 N-mm
B.M. at D,
MDV = RBV × 250 = 1958 × 250 = 489.5 × 103 N-mm
The bending moment diagram for vertical loading is shown in Fig. 14.6 (e).
Now consider the horizontal loading at C and D. Let RAH and RBH be the reactions at the bearings
A and B respectively. We know that
RAH + RBH = 849 + 4000 = 4849 N
Taking moments about A, we get
RBH × 800 = 4000 (800 – 250) + 849 × 200 = 2 369 800
∴
RBH = 2 369 800 / 800 = 2963 N
and
RAH = 4849 – 2963 = 1886 N
We know that B.M. at A and B,
MAH = MBH = 0
B.M. at C,
MCH = RAH × 200 = 1886 × 200 = 377 200 N-mm
B.M. at D,
MDH = RBH × 250 = 2963 × 250 = 740 750 N-mm

mD = 5 mm ; BD = 100 mm ; TC = 100 ; mC = 5 mm ; AC = 150 mm ; τ = 54 MPa = 54 N/mm2

Now let us find the maximum bending moment for vertical and horizontal loading.
First of all, considering the vertical loading at C. Let RAV and RBV be the reactions at the bearings
A and B respectively. We know that
RAV + RBV = 2870 N
Taking moments about A, we get
RBV × 750 = 2870 × 150

∴
RBV = 2870 × 150 / 750 = 574 N
and
RAV

We know that B.M. at A and B,

B.M. at C,

B.M. at D,
MDV = RBV × 100 = 574 × 100 = 57 400 N-mm
The B.M. diagram for vertical loading is shown in Fig. 14.8 (e).
Now considering horizontal loading at D. Let RAH and RBH be the reactions at the bearings A and
B respectively. We know that
RAH + RBH = 9550 N
Taking moments about A, we get
RBH × 750 = 9550 (750 – 100) = 9550 × 650
∴
RBH = 9550 × 650 / 750 = 8277 N
and
RAH = 9550 – 8277 = 1273 N
We know that B.M. at A and B,
MAH = MBH = 0
B.M. at C,
MCH = RAH × 150 = 1273 × 150 = 190 950 N-mm
B.M. at D,
MDH = RBH × 100 = 8277 × 100 = 827 700 N-mm

14.12 Shafts Subjected to Fluctuating Loads
In the previous articles we have assumed that the shaft is
subjected to constant torque and bending moment. But in actual
practice, the shafts are subjected to fluctuating torque and
bending moments. In order to design such shafts like line shafts
and counter shafts, the combined shock and fatigue factors
must be taken into account for the computed twisting
moment (T ) and bending moment (M ). Thus for a shaft

Example 14.12. A mild steel shaft transmits 20 kW at 200 r.p.m. It carries a central load of 900
N and is simply supported between the bearings 2.5 metres apart. Determine the size of the shaft, if
the allowable shear stress is 42 MPa and the maximum tensile or compressive stress is not to exceed
56 MPa. What size of the shaft will be required, if it is subjected to gradually applied loads?
Solution. Given : P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W ; N = 200 r.p.m. ; W = 900 N ; L = 2.5 m ;

Example 14.13. Design a shaft to transmit power from an electric motor to a lathe head stock
through a pulley by means of a belt drive. The pulley weighs 200 N and is located at 300 mm from the
centre of the bearing. The diameter of the pulley is 200 mm and the maximum power transmitted is
1 kW at 120 r.p.m. The angle of lap of the belt is 180° and coefficient of friction between the belt and
the pulley is 0.3. The shock and fatigue factors for bending and twisting are 1.5 and 2.0 respectively.
The allowable shear stress in the shaft may be taken as 35 MPa.
Solution. Given : W = 200 N ; L = 300 mm ; D = 200 mm or R = 100 mm ;
P = 1 kW = 1000 W ; N = 120 r.p.m. ; θ = 180° = π rad ; μ = 0.3 ; Km = 1.5 ; Kt = 2 ;

Example 14.14. Fig. 14.10 shows a shaft carrying a pulley A and a gear B and supported in
two bearings C and D. The shaft transmits 20 kW at 150 r.p.m. The tangential force Ft on the gear B

The pulley delivers the power through a belt to another pulley of equal diameter vertically
below the pulley A. The ratio of tensions T1 / T2 is equal to 2.5. The gear and the pulley weigh 900 N
and 2700 N respectively. The permissible shear stress for the material of the shaft may be taken as
63 MPa. Assuming the weight of the shaft to be negligible in comparison with the other loads, determine
its diameter. Take shock and fatigue factors for bending and torsion as 2 and 1.5 respectively.
Solution. Given : P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W ; N = 150 r.p.m. ; T1/T2 = 2.5 ; WB = 900 N ;
WA = 2700 N ; τ = 63 MPa = 63 N/mm2 ; Km = 2 ; Kt = 1.5 ; DB = 750 mm or RB = 375 mm ;

Fig. 14.10
Let
T1 and T2 = Tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt on pulley A.
Since the torque on the pulley is same as that of shaft (i.e. 1273 × 103 N-mm), therefore
(T1 – T2) RA = 1273 × 103
or
T1 – T2 = 1273 × 103 / 625 = 2037 N
...(i)
Since
T1 / T2 = 2.5
or
T1 = 2.5 T2, therefore
2.5 T2 – T2 = 2037
or
T2 = 2037/1.5 = 1358 N
...[From equation (i)]
and
T1 = 2.5 × 1358 = 3395 N
∴Total vertical load acting downward on the shaft at A
= T1 + T2 + WA = 3395 + 1358 + 2700 = 7453 N

Now let us find the reactions at the bearings C and D. Let RC and RD be the reactions at C and
D respectively. A little consideration will show that the reaction RC will act upward while the reaction
RD act downward as shown in Fig. 14.11.

Taking moments about D, we get
RC × 1000 = 7453 × 1250 + 2495 × 350 = 10.2 × 106
∴
RC = 10.2 × 106 / 1000 = 10 200 N
Fig. 14.11
For the equilibrium of the shaft,
RD + 7453 = RC + 2495 = 10 200 + 2495 = 12 695
∴
RD = 12 695 – 7453 = 5242 N
We Know that B.M. at A and B

from the centre line of the left and right bearings. The pitch diameter of the gear C is 600 mm and
that of gear D is 200 mm. The distance between the centre line of the bearings is 2400 mm. The shaft

transmits 20 kW at 120 r.p.m. The power is delivered to the shaft at gear C and is taken out at gear
D in such a manner that the tooth pressure FtC of the gear C and FtD of the gear D act vertically
downwards.
Find the diameter of the shaft, if the working stress is 100 MPa in tension and 56 MPa in shear.
The gears C and D weighs 950 N and 350 N respectively. The combined shock and fatigue factors for
bending and torsion may be taken as 1.5 and 1.2 respectively.
Solution. Given : AC = 250 mm ; BD = 400 mm ; DC = 600 mm or RC = 300 mm ; DD = 200 mm
or RD = 100 mm ; AB = 2400 mm ; P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W ; N = 120 r.p.m ; σt = 100
MPa = 100 N/mm2 ; τ = 56 MPa = 56 N/mm2 ; WC = 950 N ; WD = 350 N ; Km = 1.5 ; Kt = 1.2

Now assuming the shaft as a simply supported beam as shown in Fig. 14.13, the maximum
bending moment may be obtained as discussed below :
Fig. 14.13
Let
RA and RB = Reactions at A and B respectively.
∴
RA + RB = Total load acting downwards at C and D
= 6250 + 16 250 = 22 500 N
Now taking moments about A,
RB × 2400 = 16 250 × 2000 + 6250 × 250 = 34 062.5 × 103
∴
RB = 34 062.5 × 103 / 2400 = 14 190 N
and
RA = 22 500 – 14 190 = 8310 N
A little consideration will show that the maximum bending moment will be either at C or D.
We know that bending moment at C,
MC = RA × 250 = 8310 × 250 = 2077.5 × 103  N-mm

*MD = RB × 400 = 14 190 × 400 = 5676 × 103  N-mm

Example 14.16. A hoisting drum 0.5 m in diameter is keyed to a shaft which is supported in two
bearings and driven through a 12 : 1 reduction ratio by an electric motor. Determine the power of the
driving motor, if the maximum load of 8 kN is hoisted at a speed of 50 m/min and the efficiency of the
drive is 80%. Also determine the torque on the drum shaft and the speed of the motor in r.p.m.
Determine also the diameter of the shaft made of machinery steel, the working stresses of which are
115 MPa in tension and 50 MPa in shear. The drive gear whose diameter is 450 mm is mounted at the
end of the shaft such that it overhangs the nearest bearing by 150 mm. The combined shock and
fatigue factors for bending and torsion may be taken as 2 and 1.5 respectively.
Solution. Given : D = 0.5 m or R = 0.25 m ; Reduction ratio = 12 : 1 ; W = 8 kN = 8000 N ;
v = 50 m/min ; η = 80% = 0.8 ; σt = 115 MPa = 115 N/mm2 ; τ = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2 ; D1 = 450 mm
or R1 = 225 mm = 0.225 m ; Overhang = 150 mm = 0.15 m ; Km = 2 ; Kt = 1.5
Power of the driving motor
We know that the energy supplied to the hoisting drum per minute
= W × v = 8000 × 50 = 400 × 103 N-m/min
∴Power supplied to the hoisting drum

 = 6670 W = 6.67 kW
...(Q 1 N-m/s = 1 W)
Since the efficiency of the drive is 0.8, therefore power of the driving motor
= 6.67
0.8  = 8.33 kW Ans.
Torque on the drum shaft
We know that the torque on the drum shaft,
T = W.R = 8000 × 0.25 = 2000 N-m Ans.

Example 14.17. A solid steel shaft is supported on two bearings 1.8 m apart and rotates at 250
r.p.m. A 20° involute gear D, 300 mm diameter is keyed to the shaft at a distance of 150 mm to the left
on the right hand bearing. Two pulleys B and C are located on the shaft at distances of 600 mm and
1350 mm respectively to the right of the left hand bearing. The diameters of the pulleys B and C are
750 mm and 600 mm respectively. 30 kW is supplied to the gear, out of which 18.75 kW is taken off at
the pulley C and 11.25 kW from pulley B. The drive from B is vertically downward while from C the
drive is downward at an angle of 60° to the horizontal. In both cases the belt tension ratio is 2 and
the angle of lap is 180°. The combined fatigue and shock factors for torsion and bending may be
taken as 1.5 and 2 respectively.

 Kt = 1.5 ; Km = 2 ; τ = 42 MPa = 42 N/mm2 ; σt = 84 MPa = 84 N/mm2
First of all, let us find the total loads acting on the gear D and pulleys C and B respectively.

The normal load acts at 20° to the vertical as shown in
Fig. 14.14. Resolving the normal load vertically and horizontally,
we have
Vertical component of WD
= WD cos 20° = 8130 × 0.9397 = 7640 N
Horizontal component of WD
= WD sin 20° = 8130 × 0.342 = 2780 N

Let
TC1 and TC2 = Tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt for pulleyC.
We know that torque transmitted by pulley C (TC),
716 = (TC1 – TC2) RC = (TC1 – TC2) 0.3
∴
TC1 – TC2 = 716 / 0.3 = 2387 N
...(i)
Since
TC1 / TC2 = 2  or  TC1 = 2 TC2, therefore from equation (i), we have
TC2 = 2387 N ; and TC1 = 4774 N
∴ Total load acting on pulley C,
WC = TC1 + TC2 = 4774 + 2387 = 7161 N
      ...(Neglecting weight of pulley C)
This load acts at 60° to the horizontal as shown in Fig.
14.15. Resolving the load WC into vertical and horizontal
components, we have
Vertical component of WC
= WC sin 60° = 7161 × 0.866

Let

We know that torque transmitted by pulley B (TB),
430 = (TB1 – TB2) RB = (TB1 – TB2) 0.375
∴
TB1 – TB2 = 430 / 0.375 = 1147 N
...(ii)
Since
TB1 / TB2 = 2   or  TB1 = 2TB2, therefore from equation (ii), we have
TB2 = 1147 N, and TB1 = 2294 N
∴Total load acting on pulley B,
WB = TB1 + TB2 = 2294 + 1147 = 3441 N
This load acts vertically downwards.
From above, we may say that the shaft is subjected to the vertical and horizontal loads as

The vertical and horizontal load diagrams are shown in Fig. 14.16 (c) and (d).
First of all considering vertical loading on the shaft. Let RPV and RQV be the reactions at
bearings P and Q respectively for vertical loading. We know that
RPV + RQV = 7640 + 6200 + 3441 = 17 281 N
Fig. 14.16

Shafts     543
Taking moments about P, we get
RQV × 1.8 = 7640 × 1.65 + 6200 × 1.35 + 3441 × 0.6 = 23 041
∴
RQV = 23 041 / 1.8 = 12 800 N
and
RPV = 17 281 – 12 800 = 4481 N
We know that B.M. at P and Q,
MPV = MQV = 0
B.M. at B,
MBV = 4481 × 0.6 = 2690 N-m
B.M. at C,
MCV = 4481 × 1.35 – 3441 × 0.75 = 3470 N-m
and
B.M. at D,
MDV = 12 800 × 0.15 = 1920 N-m
The bending moment diagram for vertical loading is shown in Fig. 14.16 (e).
Now considering horizontal loading. Let RPH and RQH be the reactions at the bearings P and Q
respectively for horizontal loading. We know that
RPH + RQH = 2780 + 3580 = 6360 N
Taking moments about P, we get
RQH × 1.8 = 2780 × 1.65 + 3580 × 1.35 = 9420 N
∴
RQH = 9420 / 1.8 = 5233 N
and
RPH = 6360 – 5233 = 1127 N
We know that B.M. at P and Q,
MPH = MQH = 0
B.M. at B,
MBH = 1127 × 0.6 = 676 N-m
B.M. at C,
MCH = 1127 × 1.35 = 1521 N-m
and  B.M. at D,
MDH = 5233 × 0.15 = 785 N-m
The bending moment diagram for horizontal loading is shown in Fig. 14.16 ( f ).

It may be noted that for a solid shaft, k = 0 and d0 = d. When the shaft carries no axial load, then F = 0 and
when the shaft carries axial tensile load, then α = 1.
Example 14.18. A hollow shaft is subjected to a maximum torque of 1.5 kN-m and a maximum
bending moment of 3 kN-m. It is subjected, at the same time, to an axial load of 10 kN. Assume that
the load is applied gradually and the ratio of the inner diameter to the outer diameter is 0.5. If the
outer diameter of the shaft is 80 mm, find the shear stress induced in the shaft.
Solution. Given : T = 1.5 kN-m = 1.5 × 103 N-m ; M = 3 kN-m = 3 × 103 N-m ;
F = 10 kN = 10 × 103 N ; k = di / do = 0.5 ; do = 80 mm = 0.08 m
Let                        τ = Shear stress induced in the shaft.
Since the load is applied gradually, therefore from Table 14.2, we find that
                          Km =1.5 ; and Kt = 1.0
*
The value of column factor (α) for tensile load is unity.
**
 It is an Euler’s formula for long columns.

Example 14.19. A hollow shaft of 0.5 m outside diameter and 0.3 m inside diameter is used to
drive a propeller of a marine vessel. The shaft is mounted on bearings 6 metre apart and it transmits
5600 kW at 150 r.p.m. The maximum axial propeller thrust is 500 kN and the shaft weighs 70 kN.

the maximum bending moment is 1000 N-m, the maximum torsional moment is 500 N-m and axial
compressive load is 15 kN. The shaft is supported on rigid bearings 1.5 m apart. The maximum
permissible shear stress on the shaft is 40 MPa. The inside diameter is 0.8 times the outside diameter.

∴
do = 72.4 mm
Thus the value of do to be substituted in equation (iii) must be greater than 72.4 mm.
14.14 Design of Shafts on the basis of Rigidity
Sometimes the shafts are to be designed on the basis of rigidity. We shall consider the following
two types of rigidity.
1. Torsional rigidity. The torsional rigidity is important in the case of camshaft of an I.C.
engine where the timing of the valves would be effected. The permissible amount of twist should not
exceed 0.25° per metre length of such shafts. For line shafts or transmission shafts, deflections 2.5 to
3 degree per metre length may be used as limiting value. The widely used deflection for the shafts is
limited to 1 degree in a length equal to twenty times the diameter of the shaft.
The torsional deflection may be obtained by using the torsion equation,
T

where
θ = Torsional deflection or angle of twist in radians,

...(For hollow shaft)
G = Modulus of rigidity for the shaft material, and
L = Length of the shaft.
2. Lateral rigidity. It is important in case of transmission shafting and shafts running at high
speed, where small lateral deflection would cause huge out-of-balance forces. The lateral rigidity is
also important for maintaining proper bearing clearances and for correct gear teeth alignment. If the
shaft is of uniform cross-section, then the lateral deflection of a shaft may be obtained by using the
deflection formulae as in Strength of Materials. But when the shaft is of variable cross-section, then
Contents

the lateral deflection may be determined from the fundamental equation for the elastic curve of a
beam, i.e.

Example 14.21. A steel spindle transmits 4 kW at 800 r.p.m. The angular deflection should not
exceed 0.25° per metre of the spindle. If the modulus of rigidity for the material of the spindle is 84
GPa, find the diameter of the spindle and the shear stress induced in the spindle.

Example 14.22. Compare the weight, strength and stiffness of a hollow shaft of the same external
diameter as that of solid shaft. The inside diameter of the hollow shaft being half the external diameter.
Both the shafts have the same material and length.
Solution. Given : do = d ; di = do / 2   or  k = di / do = 1 / 2 = 0.5

15.1 Introduction
A lever is a rigid rod or bar capable of turning about
a fixed point called fulcrum. It is used as a machine to lift
a load by the application of a small effort. The ratio of load
lifted to the effort applied is called mechanical advantage.
Sometimes, a lever is merely used to facilitate the
application of force in a desired direction. A lever may be
straight or curved and the forces applied on the lever (or
by the lever) may be parallel or inclined to one another.
The principle on which the lever works is same as that of
moments.
Consider a straight lever with parallel forces acting
in the same plane as shown in Fig 15.1. The points A and B
through which the load and effort is applied are known as
load and effort points respectively. F is the fulcrum about
which the lever is capable of turning. The perpendicular
distance between the load point and fulcrum (l1) is known
as load arm and the perpendicular distance between the

effort point and fulcrum (l2) is called effort arm. According to the principle of moments,

The ratio of the effort arm to the load arm i.e. l2 / l1 is called leverage.
A little consideration will show that if a large load is to be lifted by a small effort, then the
effort arm should be much greater than the load arm. In some cases, it may not be possible to
provide a lever with large effort arm due to space limitations. Therefore in order to obtain a great
leverage, compound levers may be used. The compound levers may be made of straight pieces,
which may be attached to one another with pin joints. The bell cranked levers may be used instead
of a number of jointed levers. In a compound lever, the leverage is the product of leverages of
various levers.
15.2 Application of Levers in Engineering Practice
The load W and the effort P may be applied to the lever in three different ways as shown in
Fig. 15.2. The levers shown at (a), (b) and (c) in Fig. 15.2 are called first type, second type and third
type of levers respectively.
In the first type of levers, the fulcrum is in between the load and effort. In this case, the effort
arm is greater than load arm, therefore mechanical advantage obtained is more than one. Such type of
levers are commonly found in bell cranked levers used in railway signalling arrangement, rocker arm
in internal combustion engines, handle of a hand pump, hand wheel of a punching press, beam of a
balance, foot lever etc.
Fig. 15.2. Type of levers.
In the second type of levers, the load is in between the fulcrum and effort. In this case, the effort
arm is more than load arm, therefore the mechanical advantage is more than one. The application of
such type of levers is found in levers of loaded safety valves.
In the third type of levers, the effort is in between the fulcrum and load. Since the effort arm, in
this case, is less than the load arm, therefore the mechanical advantage is less that one. The use of
such type of levers is not recommended in engineering practice. However a pair of tongs, the treadle
of a sewing machine etc. are examples of this type of lever.
15.3 Design of a Lever
The design of a lever consists in determining the physical dimensions of a lever when forces
acting on the lever are given. The forces acting on the lever are
1. Load (W), 2. Effort (P), and 3. Reaction at the fulcrum F (RF).
Contents
Top
560    A Textbook of Machine Design
The load and effort cause moments in opposite directions about the fulcrum.
The following procedure is usually adopted in the design of a lever :
1. Generally the load W is given. Find the value of the effort (P) required to resist this load by
taking moments about the fulcrum. When the load arm is equal to the effort arm, the effort required
will be equal to the load provided the friction at bearings is neglected.
2. Find the reaction at the fulcrum (RF), as discussed below :
(i) When W and P are parallel and their direction is same as shown in Fig. 15.2 (a), then
RF = W + P
The direction of RF will be opposite to that of W and P.
(ii)  When W and P are parallel and acts in opposite directions as shown in Fig. 15.2 (b) and (c),
then RF will be the difference of W and P. For load positions as shown in Fig. 15.2 (b),
RF = W – P
and for load positions as shown in Fig. 15.2 (c),
RF = P – W
The direction of RF will be opposite to that of W or P whichever is greater.
(iii) When W and P are inclined to each other as shown in Fig. 15.3 (a), then RF, which is equal
to the resultant of W and P, is determined by parallelogram law of forces. The line of action of RF
passes through the intersection of W and P and also through F. The direction of RF depends upon the
direction of W and P.
(iv) When W and P acts at right angles and the arms are inclined at an angle θ as shown in
Fig. 15.3 (b), then RF is determined by using the following relation :
RF =

3. Knowing the forces acting on the lever, the cross-section of the arm may be determined by
considering the section of the lever at which the maximum bending moment occurs. In case of levers
having two arms as shown in Fig. 15.4 (a) and cranked levers, the maximum bending moment occurs
at the boss. The cross-section of the arm may be rectangular, elliptical or I-section as shown in
Fig. 15.4 (b). We know that section modulus for rectangular section,

where
t = Breadth or thickness of the lever, and

where
a = Major axis, and b = Minor axis.

562    A Textbook of Machine Design
For I-section, it is assumed that the bending moment is taken by flanges only. With this assumption,
the section modulus is given by
Z = Flange area × depth of section
The section of the arm is usually tapered from the fulcrum to the ends. The dimensions of the
arm at the ends depends upon the manner in which the load is applied. If the load at the end is applied
by forked connections, then the dimensions of the lever at the end can be proportioned as a knuckle
joint.
4. The dimensions of the fulcrum pin are obtained from bearing considerations and then checked
for shear. The allowable bearing pressure depends upon the amount of relative motion between the
pin and the lever. The length of pin is usually taken from 1 to 1.25 times the diameter of pin. If the
forces on the lever do not differ much, the diameter of the pins at load and effort point shall be taken
equal to the diameter of the fulcrum pin so that the spares are reduced. Instead of choosing a thick
lever, the pins are provided with a boss in order to provide sufficient bearing length.
5. The diameter of the boss is taken twice the diameter of pin and length of the boss equal to the
length of pin. The boss is usually provided with a 3 mm thick phosphor bronze bush with a dust proof
lubricating arrangement in order to reduce wear and to increase the life of lever.
Example 15.1. A handle for turning the spindle of a large valve is shown in Fig. 15.5. The
length of the handle from the centre of the spindle is 450 mm. The handle is attached to the spindle by
means of a round tapered pin.
Fig. 15.5
If an effort of 400 N is applied at the end of the handle, find: 1. mean diameter of the tapered
pin, and 2. diameter of the handle.
The allowable stresses for the handle and pin are 100 MPa in tension and 55 MPa in shear.
Solution. Given : L = 450 mm ; P = 400 N ; σt = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2 ; τ = 55 MPa= 55 N/mm2

T = P × 2L = 400 × 2 × 450 = 360 × 103 N-mm

2. Diameter of the handle
Let
D = Diameter of the handle.
Since the handle is subjected to both bending moment and twisting moment, therefore the design
will be based on either equivalent twisting moment or equivalent bending moment. We know that
bending moment,
M = P × L = 400 × 450 = 180 × 103 N-mm
The twisting moment depends upon the point of application of the effort. Assuming that the
effort acts at a distance 100 mm from the end of the handle, we have twisting moment,
T = 400 × 100 = 40 × 103 N-mm
We know that equivalent twisting moment,

Taking larger of the two values, we have
D = 26.5 mm  Ans.
Example 15.2. A vertical lever PQR, 15 mm thick
is attached by a fulcrum pin at R and to a horizontal
rod at Q, as shown in Fig. 15.6.
An operating force of 900 N is applied horizontally

1. Reactions at Q and R,
2. Tensile stress in 12 mm diameter tie rod at Q
3. Shear stress in 12 mm diameter pins at P, Q

Solution. Given : t = 15 mm ; FP = 900 N
1. Reactions at Q and R
Let
RQ = Reaction at Q, and
RR = Reaction at R,
Taking moments about R, we have
RQ × 150 = 900 × 950 = 855 000

15.4 Hand Levers
A hand lever with suitable dimensions and proportions is shown in Fig. 15.8.
Let
P = Force applied at the handle,
L = Effective length of the lever,
σt = Permissible tensile stress, and
τ = Permissible shear stress.
For wrought iron, σt may be taken as 70 MPa and τ as 60 MPa.
In designing hand levers, the following procedure may be followed :
1. The diameter of the shaft ( d ) is obtained by considering the shaft under pure torsion. We
know that twisting moment on the shaft,
T = P × L
and resisting torque,
T =

d
π × τ ×
From this relation, the diameter of the shaft ( d ) may be obtained.
Fig. 15.8. Hand lever.
2. The diameter of the boss (d2) is taken as 1.6 d and thickness of the boss (t2) as 0.3 d.
3. The length of the boss (l2) may be taken from d to 1.25 d. It may be checked for a trial
thickness t2 by taking moments about the axis. Equating the twisting moment (P × L) to the moment

6. The cross-section of the lever near the boss may be determined by considering the lever in
bending. It is assumed that the lever extends to the centre of the shaft which results in a stronger
section of the lever.
Let
t = Thickness of lever near the boss, and
B = Width or height of lever near the boss.

The width of the lever near the boss may be taken from 4 to 5 times the thickness of lever, i.e.
 B = 4 t to 5 t. The width of the lever is tapered but the thickness (t) is kept constant. The width of the
lever near the handle is B/2.
Note: For hand levers, about 400 N is considered as full force which a man is capable of exerting. About 100 N
is the mean force which a man can exert on the working handle of a machine, off and on for a full working day.
15.5 Foot Lever
A foot lever, as shown in Fig. 15.9, is similar to hand lever but in this case a foot plate is
provided instead of handle. The foot lever may be designed in a similar way as discussed for hand
lever. For foot levers, about 800 N is considered as full force which a man can exert in pushing a foot
lever. The proportions of the foot plate are shown in Fig. 15.9.
Example 15.3. A foot lever is 1 m from the centre of shaft to the point of application of 800 N
load. Find :
1. Diameter of the shaft, 2. Dimensions of the key, and 3. Dimensions of rectangular arm of the
foot lever at 60 mm from the centre of shaft assuming width of the arm as 3 times thickness.
The allowable tensile stress may be taken as 73 MPa and allowable shear stress as 70 MPa.

Solution. Given : L = 1 m = 1000 mm ; P = 800 N ; σt = 73 MPa = 73 N/mm2 ;
τ = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2
1.  Diameter of the shaft
Let
d = Diameter of the shaft.
We know that the twisting moment on the shaft,
T = P × L = 800 × 1000 = 800 × 103 N-mm

We know that diameter of the boss,
d2 = 1.6 d = 1.6 × 40 = 64 mm
Thickness of the boss,
t2 = 0.3 d = 0.3 × 40 = 12 mm
and length of the boss,
l2 = 1.25 d = 1.25 × 40 = 50 mm

centre of the bearing (d1) is given by the relation

It may be taken as equal to the length of boss (l2).

15.6 Cranked Lever
A cranked lever, as shown in Fig. 15.10, is a hand lever commonly used for operating hoisting
winches.
The lever can be operated either by a single person or by two persons. The maximum force in
order to operate the lever may be taken as 400 N and the length of handle as 300 mm. In case the lever
is operated by two persons, the maximum force of operation will be doubled and length of handle
may be taken as 500 mm. The handle is covered in a pipe to prevent hand scoring. The end of the shaft
is usually squared so that the lever may be easily fixed and removed. The length (L) is usually from
400 to 450 mm and the height of the shaft centre line from the ground is usually one metre. In order
to design such levers, the following procedure may be adopted :

From this expression, the diameter of the handle ( d ) may be evaluated. The diameter of the
handle is usually proportioned as 25 mm for single person and 40 mm for two persons.
2. The cross-section of the lever arm is usually rectangular having uniform thickness through-
out. The width of the lever arm is tapered from the boss to the handle. The arm is subjected to
constant twisting moment, T = 2

×  and a varying bending moment which is maximum near the
boss. It is assumed that the arm of the lever extends upto the centre of shaft, which results in a slightly
stronger lever.
∴ Maximum bending moment = P × L
Since, at present time, there is insufficient information on the subject of combined bending and
twisting of rectangular sections to enable us to find equivalent bending or twisting, with sufficient
accuracy, therefore the indirect procedure is adopted.
We shall design the lever arm for 25% more bending moment.
∴  Maximum bending moment
M = 1.25 P × L
Let
t = Thickness of the lever arm, and
B = Width of the lever arm near the boss.

Now by using the relation, σb = M / Z, we can find t and B. The width of the lever arm near the

After finding the value of t and B, the induced bending stress may be checked which should not
exceed the permissible value.

Length of the handle

Overhang of the journal = 100 mm
If the lever is operated by a single person exerting a maximum force of 400 N at a distance of
1
3 rd length of the handle from its free end, find : 1. Diameter of the handle, 2. Cross-section of the
lever arm, and 3. Diameter of the journal.
The permissible bending stress for the lever material may be taken as 50 MPa and shear stress
for shaft material as 40 MPa.
Solution. Given : l = 300 mm ; L = 400 mm ; x = 100 mm ; P = 400 N ; σb = 50 MPa

15.7 Lever for a Lever Safety Valve
A lever safety valve is shown in Fig. 15.11. It is used to maintain a constant safe pressure inside
the boiler. When the pressure inside the boiler increases the safe value, the excess steam blows off
through the valve automatically. The valve rests over the gunmetal seat which is secured to a casing
fixed upon the boiler. One end of the lever is pivoted at the fulcrum F by a pin to the toggle, while the
other end carries the weights. The valve is held on its seat against the upward steam pressure by the
force P provided by the weights at B. The weights and its distance from the fulcrum are so adjusted
that when the steam pressure acting upward on the valve exceeds the normal limit, it lifts the valve
and the lever with its weights. The excess steam thus escapes until the pressure falls to the required
limit.

where
D = Diameter of the valve, and

Example 15.5. A lever loaded safety valve is 70 mm in diameter and is to be designed for a
boiler to blow-off at pressure of 1 N/mm2 gauge. Design a suitable mild steel lever of rectangular
cross-section using the following permissible stresses :
Tensile stress = 70 MPa; Shear stress = 50 MPa; Bearing pressure intensity = 25 N/mm2.
The pin is also made of mild steel. The distance from the fulcrum to the weight of the lever is
880 mm and the distance between the fulcrum and pin connecting the valve spindle links to the lever
is 80 mm.
Solution. Given : D = 70 mm ; p = 1 N/mm2 ; σt = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2 ; τ = 50 MPa =
50 N/mm2 ; pb = 25 N/mm2 ; FB = 880 mm ; FA = 80 mm

P × 880 = 3850 × 80 = 308 × 103   or   P = 308 × 103 / 880 = 350 N
Since the load (W ) and the effort (P) in the form of dead weight are parallel and opposite,
therefore reaction at F,
RF = W – P = 3850 – 350 = 3500 N
This rection will act vertically downward as shown in Fig. 15.12.

First of all, let us find the diameter of the pin at A from bearing considerations.
Let
dp = Diameter of the pin at A, and
lp = Length of the pin at A.
Contents
Top
574    A Textbook of Machine Design
∴  Bearing area of the pin at A
= dp × lp = 1.25 (dp)2
...(Assuming lp = 1.25 dp)
and load on the pin at A
= Bearing area × Bearing pressure
= 1.25 (dp)2 pb = 1.25 (dp)2 25 = 31.25 (dp)2
...(ii)
Since the load acting on the pin at A is W = 3850 N, therefore from equations (i) and (ii), we get
(dp)2 = 3850 / 31.25 = 123.2    or   dp = 11.1 say 12 mm Ans.
and
lp = 1.25 dp = 1.25 × 12 = 15 mm Ans.
Let us now check the pin for shearing. Since the pin is in double shear, therefore load on the pin
at A (W),

τ  = 226.2 τ
∴
τ = 3850 / 226.2 = 17.02 N/mm2 = 17.02 MPa
This value of shear stress is less than the permissible value of 50 MPa, therefore the design for
pin at A is safe. Since the load at F does not very much differ with the load at A, therefore the same
diameter of pin may be used at F, in order to facilitate the interchangeability of parts.
∴Diameter of the fulcrum pin at F
= 12 mm
A gun metal bush of 2 mm thickness is provided in the pin holes at A and F in order to reduce
wear and to increase the life of lever.
∴  Diameter of hole at A and F
= 12 + 2 × 2 = 16 mm
and outside diameter of the boss
= 2 × Dia. of hole = 2 × 16 = 32 mm

Now let us check for the maximum shear stress induced in the lever. From the shear force
diagram as shown in Fig. 15.13 (a), we see that the maximum shear force on the lever is (W – P) i.e.
3500 N.

15.8 Bell Crank Lever
In a bell crank lever, the two arms of the lever are at right angles. Such type of levers are used in
railway signalling, governors of Hartnell type, the drive for the air pump of condensors etc. The bell
crank lever is designed in a similar way as discussed earlier. The arms of the bell crank lever may be
assumed of rectangular, elliptical or I-section. The complete design procedure for the bell crank lever
is given in the following example.
Example 15.6. Design a right angled bell crank lever. The horizontal arm is 500 mm long and
a load of 4.5 kN acts vertically downward through a pin in the forked end of this arm. At the end of
the 150 mm long arm which is perpendicular to the 500 mm long arm, a force P act at right angles
to the axis of 150 mm arm through a pin into a forked end. The lever consists of forged steel material
and a pin at the fulcrum. Take the following data for both the pins and lever material:
Safe stress in tension = 75 MPa
Safe stress in shear = 60 MPa
Safe bearing pressure on pins = 10 N/mm2
Solution. Given : FB = 500 mm ; W = 4.5 kN = 4500 N ; FA = 150 mm ; σt = 75 MPa
= 75 N/mm2 ; τ = 60 MPa = 60 N/mm2 ; pb = 10 N/mm2
The bell crank lever is shown in Fig. 15.14.
Fig. 15.14
First of all, let us find the effort (P) required to raise the load (W ). Taking moments about the
fulcrum F, we have
W × 500 = P × 150

1. Design for fulcrum pin
Let
d = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l = Length of the fulcrum pin.
Considering the fulcrum pin in bearing. We know that load on the fulcrum pin (RF),
15 660 = d × l × pb = d × 1.25 d × 10 = 12.5 d2          ...(Assuming l = 1.25 d)
∴
d 2 = 15 660 / 12.5 = 1253   or   d = 35.4 say 36 mm  Ans.
and
l = 1.25 d = 1.25 × 36 = 45 mm Ans.
Let us now check for the shear stress induced in the fulcrum pin. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore load on the fulcrum pin (RF),
15 660 =

τ  = 2036 τ
∴

Since the shear stress induced in the fulcrum pin is less than the given value of 60 MPa, therefore
design for the fulcrum pin is safe.
A brass bush of 3 mm thickness is pressed into the boss
of fulcrum as a bearing so that the renewal become simple
when wear occurs.
∴ Diameter of hole in the lever
= d + 2 × 3
= 36 + 6 = 42 mm
and diameter of boss at fulcrum
= 2 d = 2 × 36 = 72 mm
Now let us check the bending stress induced in the lever
arm at the fulcrum. The section of the fulcrum is shown in
Fig. 15.15.

Since the bending stress induced in the lever arm at the fulcrum is less than the given value of

2. Design for pin at A
Since the effort at A (which is 15 000 N), is not very much different from the reaction at fulcrum
(which is 15 660 N), therefore the same dimensions for the pin and boss may be used as for fulcrum
pin to reduce spares.
∴   Diameter of pin at A = 36 mm  Ans.
Length of pin at A
= 45 mm  Ans.
and
diameter of boss at A
= 72 mm  Ans.

3. Design for pin at B
Let
d1 = Diameter of the pin at B, and
l1 = Length of the pin at B.
Considering the bearing of the pin at B. We know that load on the pin at B (W ),
4500 = d1 × l1 × pb = d1 × 1.25 d1 × 10 = 12.5 (d1)2
... (Assuming l1 = 1.25 d1)
∴
(d1)2 = 4500 / 12.5 = 360   or   d1 = 18.97 say 20 mm Ans.
and
l1 = 1.25 d1 = 1.25 × 20 = 25 mm Ans.
Let us now check for the shear stress induced in the pin at B. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore load on the pin at B (W ),

τ =

τ  = 628.4 τ
∴

Since the shear stress induced in the pin at B is within permissible limits, therefore the design is
safe.
Since the end B is a forked end, therefore thickness of each
eye,
t1 =

l =

In order to reduce wear, chilled phosphor bronze bushes of

∴Inner diameter of each eye
= d1 + 2 × 3 = 20 + 6 = 26 mm
and outer diameter of eye,
D = 2 d1 = 2 × 20 = 40 mm
Let us now check the induced bending stress in the pin. The
pin is neither simply supported nor rigidly fixed at its ends.
Therefore the common practice is to assume the load distribution
as shown in Fig. 15.16. The maximum bending moment will occur
at Y-Y.

4. Design of lever
It is assumed that the lever extends upto the centre of the fulcrum from the point of application
of the load. This assumption is commonly made and results in a slightly stronger section. Considering
the weakest section of failure at Y-Y.
Let
t = Thickness of the lever at Y-Y, and
b = Width or depth of the lever at Y-Y.
Taking distance from the centre of the fulcrum to Y-Y as 50 mm, therefore maximum bending

Example 15.7. In a Hartnell governor, the length of the ball arm is 190 mm, that of the sleeve
arm is 140 mm, and the mass of each ball is 2.7 kg. The distance of the pivot of each bell crank lever
from the axis of rotation is 170 mm and the speed when the ball arm is vertical, is 300 r.p.m. The
speed is to increase 0.6 per cent for a lift of 12 mm of the sleeve.
(a) Find the necessary stiffness of the spring.
(b) Design the bell crank lever. The permissible tensile stress for the material of the lever may
be taken as 80 MPa and the allowable bearing pressure at the pins is 8 N/mm2.
Solution. Given : x = 190 mm ; y = 140 mm ; m = 2.7 kg ; r2 = 170 mm = 0.17 m ;
N2 = 300 r.p.m. ; h = 12 mm ; σt = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; pb = 8 N/mm2

The fulcrum pin is supported in the eye which is integral with the frame for the spring. Considering
the fulcrum pin in bearing. We know that load on the fulcrum pin (RF),

∴

and
l = 1.25 d = 1.25 × 10 = 12.5 d = 12.5 mm Ans.

2. Design for lever
The cross-section of the lever is obtained by considering the lever in bending. It is assumed that
the lever arm extends upto the centre of the fulcrum from the point of application of load. This
assumption results in a slightly stronger lever. Considering the weakest section of failure at Y-Y

The ball is screwed to the end of the lever. The screwed length of lever will be equal to the
radius of ball.
∴  Maximum bending moment on the screwed end of the lever,

The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (at least 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye. In the present case, 23 mm outer diameter of the roller will be sufficient. The
roller is not provided with bush because after sufficient service, the roller has to be replaced due to
wear on the profile. A clearance of 1.5 mm is provided between the roller and fork on either side of
roller.

15.9 Rocker Arm for Exhaust Valve
A rocker arm for operating the exhaust valve is shown in Fig. 15.20. In designing a rocker arm,
the following procedure may be followed :
1. The rocker arm is usually of I-section. Due to the load on the valve, it is subjected to bending
moment. In order to find the bending moment, it is assumed that the arm of the lever extends
from the point of application of the load to the centre of the pivot which acts as a fulcrum of
the rocker arm. This assumption results in a slightly stronger lever near the boss.
2. The ratio of the length to the diameter of the fulcrum and roller pin is taken as 1.25. The
permissible bearing pressure on this pin is taken from 3.5 to 6 N/mm2.
3. The outside diameter of the boss at fulcrum is usually taken as twice the diameter of the pin
at fulcrum. The boss is provided with a 3 mm thick phosphor bronze bush to take up wear.
4. One end of the rocker arm has a forked end to receive the roller. The roller is carried on a pin
and is free to revolve in an eye to reduce wear. The pin or roller is not provided with a bush
because after sufficient service the roller has to be discarded due to wear at the profile.
5. The outside diameter of the eye at the forked end is also taken as twice the diameter of pin.
The diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (at least 3 mm more) than the diameter of
Contents
Top
Levers     585
eye at the forked end. The radial thickness of each eye of the forked end is taken as half the
diameter of pin. Some clearance, about 1.5 mm, must be provided between the roller and
eye at the forked end so that the roller can move freely. The pin should, therefore, be checked
for bending.
6. The other end of the rocker arm (i.e. tappet end) is made circular to receive the tappet which
is a stud with a lock nut. The outside diameter of the circular arm is taken as twice the
diameter of the stud. The depth of the section is also taken equal to twice the diameter of the
stud.
Example 15.8. For operating the exhaust valve of a petrol engine, the maximum load required
on the valve is 5000 N. The rocker arm oscillates around a pin whose centre line is 250 mm away
from the valve axis. The two arms of the rocker are equal and make an included angle of 160°.
Design the rocker arm with the fulcrum if the tensile stress is 70 MPa and the bearing pressure is
7 N/mm2. Assume the cross-section of the rocker arm as rectangular.
Fig. 15.20
Solution. Given : W = 5000 N ; θ = 160° ; σt = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2; pb = 7N/mm2
A rocker arm for operating the exhaust valve is shown in Fig. 15.20.
First of all, let us find out the reaction at the fulcrum pin.
Let
RF = Reaction at the fulcrum pin.
Since the two arms of the rocker are equal, therefore the load at the two ends of the arm are
equal i.e. W = P = 5000 N.

Design of fulcrum
Let
d = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l = Length of the fulcrum pin = 1.25 d
...(Assume)
Considering the bearing of the fulcrum pin. We know that load on the fulcrum pin (RF),
9850 = d × l × pb = d × 1.25 d × 7 = 8.75 d2
∴
d 2 = 9850 / 8.75 = 1126   or   d = 33.6 say 35 mm Ans.
and
l = 1.25 d = 1.25 × 35 = 43.75 say 45 mm Ans.
Now let us check the average shear stress induced in the pin. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore load on the fulcrum pin (RF),

The induced shear stess is quite safe.
Now external diameter of the boss,
D = 2 d = 2 × 35 = 70 mm
Assuming a phosphor bronze bush of 3 mm thick, the
internal diameter of the hole in the lever,
                                    dh = d + 2 × 3 = 35 + 6 = 41 mm
Now let us check the induced bending stress for the
section of the boss at the fulcrum which is shown in
Fig. 15.21.

Design for forked end
Let
d1 = Diameter of the roller pin, and
l1 = Length of the roller pin = 1.25 d1
...(Assume)
Considering bearing of the roller pin. We know that load on the roller pin (W ),
5000 = d1 × l1 × pb = d1 × 1.25 d1 × 7 = 8.75 (d1)2
∴
(d1)2 = 5000 / 8.75 = 571.4   or  d1 = 24 mm Ans.
and
l1 = 1.25 d1 = 1.25 × 24 = 30 mm Ans.
Let us now check the roller pin for induced shearing stress. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore load on the roller pin (W ),

tribution as shown in Fig. 15.22.

Since the radial thickness of eye (t2) is taken as d1 / 2, therefore overall diameter of the eye,
D1 = 2d1 = 2 × 24 = 48 mm
The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (at least 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye.
In the present case, 54 mm outer diameter of the roller will be sufficient.

We shall use 14 mm stud and it is provided with a lock nut. The
diameter of the circular end of the lever arm (D2) and its depth (t2) is

15.10 Miscellaneous Levers
In the previous articles, we have discussed the design of various types of levers used in engineering
practice. Some more types of levers designed on the same principle are discussed in the following
examples.
Example 15.9. A pressure vessel as shown in Fig. 15.24, is used as a digester in a chemical
process. It is designed to withstand a pressure of 0.2 N/mm2 by gauge. The diameter of the pressure
vessel is 600 mm. The vessel and its cover are made of cast iron. All other parts are made of steel. The
cover is held tightly against the vessel by a screw B which is turned down through the tapped hole in
the beam A, so that the end of the screw presses against the cover. The beam A is of rectangular
section in which b1 = 2 t1.
Fig. 15.24
The rectangular section is opened up at the centre to take the tapped hole as shown in the
figure. The beam is attached by pins C and D to the links G and H which are secured by pins E and
F to the extensions cast on the vessel.

Example 15.10. A cross-lever to operate a double cylinder double acting pump is shown in
Fig. 15.25. Find
1. Dimension of pins at L, M, N and Q,
2. Cross-section for the vertical arm of the lever, and
3. Cross-section for the horizontal arm of the lever.
The permissible shear stress for the material of the pin is 40 MPa. The bearing pressure on the
pins should not exeed 17.5 N/mm2.
The permissible bending stress for the material of the lever should not exceed 70 MPa.
Solution. Given : WL = 3 kN ; WN = 5 kN ; τ = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2 ; pb = 17.5 N/mm2 ;
σb = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2
First of all, let us find the effort P applied at Q. Taking moments about the fulcrum M, we have
P × 800 = 5 × 300 + 3 × 300 = 2400   or  P = 2400 / 800 = 3 kN
When both sides of pump operate, then load on the fulcrum pin M,

The worst condition arises when one side of the pump does not work. At that time, the effort
required increases. Taking moments about M, we get
P × 800 = 5 × 300 = 1500   or   P = 1500 / 800 = 1.875 kN
∴In worst condition, the resultant force on the fulcrum pin M,

 = 5.34 kN = 5340 N
Therefore the fulcrum pin M will be designed for a maximum load of 5.34 kN.
A little consideration will show that the load on the pins L and Q is 3 kN each; therefore the pins
L and Q will be of the same size. Since the load on pin N (5 kN) do not differ much with the maximum
load on pin M i.e. 5.34 kN, therefore the pins at N and M may be taken of the same size.

1. Dimension of pins at L, M, N and Q
First of all, let us find the diameter of pins at M and N. These pins will be designed for a maximum
load of 5.34 kN or 5340 N.
Let
d = Diameter of pins at M and N, and
l = Length of pins at M and N = 1.25 d
...(Assume)
Considering the bearing of the pins. We know that load on the pins,
5340 = d × l × pb = d × 1.25 d × 17.5 = 21.87 d 2
∴
d 2 = 5340 / 21.87 = 244    or    d = 15.6 say 16 mm Ans.
and
l = 1.25 d = 1.25 × 16 = 20 mm Ans.
Let us check the pin for induced shear stress. Since the pin is in double shear, therefore load on
the pin,

The induced shear stress is within safe limits.
A 3 mm thick bush may be inserted so that the diameter of hole in the lever is 22 mm. The
outside diameter of the boss may be taken as twice the diameter of hole.
∴  Outside diameter of boss = 2 × 22 = 44 mm
Let us now check the section of the lever for induced bending stress. The section at the fulcrum
is shown in Fig. 15.26.

The bending stress induced is very much within safe limits.
It should be remembered that the direction of the load will be
reversed, consequently the loads will be changed. Hence the pins at
L and N must be identical. We shall provide the pin at Q of the same size
as for L, M and N in order to avoid extra storage. Thus the diameter of
pins at L, M, N and Q is 16 mm and length 20 mm. Ans.
2.  Cross-section for the vertical arm of the lever
Considering the cross-section of the vertical arm at X-X,
Let
t = Thickness of the arm, and
b1 = Width of the arm = 3 t
 ... (Assume)
It is assumed that the length of the arm extends upto the centre of the fulcrum. This assumption
results in a slightly stronger arm.

The allowable bearing pressure on pins may be taken as 20 N/mm2. Design the pins at L, M
and N; the link and the lever.
Solution. Given : As = 5 × 3 = 15 mm2 ; τu = 400 MPa = 400 N/mm2 ; σt = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; pb
= 20 N/mm2
We know that maximum shearing force required,
Ps = Area sheared × Ultimate shearing strength
= As × τu = 15 × 400 = 6000 N
Let
P1 = Force in the link LM.
Taking moments about F, we have
P1 × 350 = Ps × 100 = 6000 × 100 = 600 × 103
∴
P1 = 600 × 103/350 = 1715 N
Again taking moments about N to find the force P required to operate the handle, we have
P × 900 = P1 × 100 = 1715 × 100 = 171 500
∴
P = 171 500/900 = 191 N
and force in the pin at
N = P1 + P = 1715 + 191 = 1906 N
Design of pins at L, M and N
We see that the force in the pins at L and M is equal to 1715 N and force in the pin at N is 1906 N.
Since the forces in pins at L, M and N do not differ very much, therefore the same size of pins may be
used. These pins will be designed for a maximum load of 1906 N.
Let
d = Diameter of the pins at L, M and N, and
l = Length of the pins = 1.25 d
...(Assume)
Considering the pins in bearing. We know that load on the pins,
1906 = d × l × pb = d × 1.25 d × 20 = 25 d2
∴
d 2 = 1906 / 25 = 76.2 or d = 8.73 say 10 mm Ans.
and
l = 1.25 d = 1.25 × 10 = 12.5 mm Ans.
Let us check the pins for induced shear stress. Since the pins are in double shear, therefore load

∴  Diameter of the boss

16.1 Introduction
A machine part subjected to an axial compressive
force is called a strut. A strut may be horizontal, inclined
or even vertical. But a vertical strut is known as a column,
pillar or stanchion. The machine members that must be
investigated for column action are piston rods, valve push
rods, connecting rods, screw jack, side links of toggle jack
etc. In this chapter, we shall discuss the design of piston
rods, valve push rods and connecting rods.
Note: The design of screw jack and toggle jack is discussed in
the next chapter on ‘Power screws’.
16.2  Failure of a Column or Strut
It has been observed that when a column or a strut is
subjected to a compressive load and the load is gradually
increased, a stage will reach when the column will be
subjected to ultimate load. Beyond this, the column will fail
by crushing and the load will be known as crushing load.
Contents
Top
Columns and Struts     601
It has also been experienced, that
sometimes, a compression member does not
fail entirely by crushing, but also by bending
i.e. buckling. This happens in the case of long
columns. It has also been observed, that all
the *short columns fail due to their crushing.
But, if a **long column is subjected to a
compressive load, it is subjected to a
compressive stress. If the load is gradually
increased, the column will reach a stage,
when it will start buckling. The load, at
which the column tends to have lateral
displacement or tends to buckle is called
buckling load, critical load, or crippling load and the column is said to have developed an elastic
instability. The buckling takes place about the axis having minimum radius of gyration or least moment
of inertia. It may be noted that for a long column, the value of buckling load will be less than the
crushing load. Moreover, the value of buckling load is low for long columns, and relatively high for
short columns.
16.3  Types of End Conditions of Columns
In actual practice, there are a number of end conditions for columns. But we shall study the
Euler’s column theory on the following four types of end conditions which are important from the
subject point of view:
1. Both the ends hinged or pin jointed as shown in Fig. 16.1 (a),
2. Both the ends fixed as shown in Fig. 16.1 (b),
3. One end is fixed and the other hinged as shown in Fig. 16.1 (c), and
4. One end is fixed and the other free as shown in Fig. 16.1 (d ).
Fig. 16.1. Types of end conditions of columns.
16.4  Euler’s Column Theory
The first rational attempt, to study the stability of long columns, was made by Mr. Euler. He
*
The columns which have lengths less than 8 times their diameter, are called short columns (see also Art 16.8).
**
The columns which have lengths more than 30 times their diameter are called long columns.
Depending on the end conditions, different columns
have different crippling  loads
Contents
Top
602    A Textbook of Machine Design
derived an equation, for the buckling load of long columns based on the bending stress. While deriving
this equation, the effect of direct stress is neglected. This may be justified with the statement, that the
direct stress induced in a long column is negligible as compared to the bending stress. It may be noted
that Euler’s formula cannot be used in the case of short columns, because the direct stress is
considerable, and hence cannot be neglected.
16.5 Assumptions in Euler’s Column Theory
The following simplifying assumptions are made in Euler’s column theory :
1. Initially the column is perfectly straight, and the load applied is truly axial.
2. The cross-section of the column is uniform throughout its length.
3. The column material is perfectly elastic, homogeneous and isotropic, and thus obeys Hooke’s
law.
4. The length of column is very large as compared to its cross-sectional dimensions.
5. The shortening of column, due to direct compression (being very small) is neglected.
6. The failure of column occurs due to buckling alone.
7. The weight of the column itself is neglected.
16.6 Euler’s Formula
According to Euler’s theory, the crippling or buckling load (Wcr) under various end conditions
is represented by a general equation,

A = Area of cross-section,

l = Length of the column, and
C = Constant, representing the end conditions of the column or end fixity
coefficient.
The following table shows the values of end fixity coefficient (C ) for various end conditions.

Notes : 1. The vertical column will have two moment of inertias (viz. Ixx and Iyy). Since the column will tend to
buckle in the direction of least moment of inertia, therefore the least value of the two moment of inertias is to be
used in the relation.
2. In the above formula for crippling load, we have not taken into account the direct stresses induced in the
material due to the load which increases gradually from zero to the crippling value. As a matter of fact, the
combined stresses (due to the direct load and slight bending), reaches its allowable value at a load lower than
that required for buckling and therefore this will be the limiting value of the safe load.

16.7  Slenderness Ratio
In Euler’s formula, the ratio l / k is known as slenderness ratio. It may be defined as the ratio of
the effective length of the column to the least radius of gyration of the section.
It may be noted that the formula for crippling load, in the previous article is based on the
assumption that the slenderness ratio l / k is so large, that the failure of the column occurs only due to
bending, the effect of direct stress (i.e. W / A) being negligible.
16.8  Limitations of Euler’s Formula
We have discussed in Art. 16.6 that the general equation for the crippling load is

A little consideration will show that the crippling stress will be high, when the slenderness ratio
is small. We know that the crippling stress for a column cannot be more than the crushing stress of the
column material. It is thus obvious that the Euler’s fromula will give the value of crippling stress of
the column (equal to the crushing stress of the column material) corresponding to the slenderness
ratio. Now consider a mild steel column. We know that the crushing stress for mild steel is 330 N/mm2
and Young’s modulus for mild steel is 0.21 × 106 N/mm2.
Now equating the crippling stress to the crushing stress, we have

or
(l / k)2 = 6281
∴
l / k = 79.25 say 80
Hence if the slenderness ratio is less than 80, Euler’s formula for a mild steel column is not
valid.
Sometimes, the columns whose slenderness ratio is more than 80, are known as long columns,
and those whose slenderness ratio is less than 80 are known as short columns. It is thus obvious that
the Euler’s formula holds good only for long columns.

where L is the equivalent length or effective length of the column. The equivalent length of a given
column with given end conditions is the length of an equivalent column of the same material and
cross-section with hinged ends to that of the given column. The relation between the equivalent
length and actual length for the given end conditions is shown in the following table.

Example 16.1. A T-section 150 mm × 120 mm × 20 mm is used as a strut of 4 m long hinged at
both ends. Calculate the crippling load, if Young’s modulus for the material of the section is
200 kN/mm2.
Solution. Given : l = 4 m = 4000 mm ; E = 200 kN/mm2 = 200 × 103 N/mm2
First of all, let us find the centre of gravity (G) of the
T-section as shown in Fig. 16.2.
Let y  be the distance between the centre of gravity (G) and
top of the flange,
We know that the area of flange,
a1 = 150 × 20 = 3000 mm2
Its distance of centre of gravity from top of the flange,
y1 = 20 / 2 = 10 mm
Area of web,
a2 = (120 – 20) 20 = 2000 mm2
Its distance of centre of gravity from top of the flange,
y2 = 20 + 100 / 2 = 70 mm

16.10 Rankine’s Formula for Columns
We have already discussed that Euler’s formula gives correct results only for very long columns.
Though this formula is applicable for columns, ranging from very long to short ones, yet it does not
give reliable results. Prof. Rankine, after a number of experiments, gave the following empirical
formula for columns.

WC = Ultimate crushing load for the column = σc × A,
WE = Crippling load, obtained by Euler’s formula =

E I
L
π
A little consideration will show, that the value of WC will remain constant irrespective of the
fact whether the column is a long one or short one. Moreover, in the case of short columns, the value
of WE will be very high, therefore the value of 1 / WE will be quite negligible as compared to 1 / WC.
It is thus obvious, that the Rankine’s formula will give the value of its crippling load (i.e. Wcr)
approximately equal to the ultimate crushing load (i.e. WC ). In case of long columns, the value of WE
will be very small, therefore the value of 1 / WE will be quite considerable as compared to 1 / WC. It
is thus obvious, that the Rankine’s formula will give the value of its crippling load (i.e. Wcr)
approximately equal to the crippling load by Euler’s formula (i.e. WE ). Thus, we see that Rankine’s
formula gives a fairly correct result for all cases of columns, ranging from short to long columns.

= Slenderness ratio.
If the safe stress (Wcr / A) is plotted against slenderness ratio (L / k), it works out to be a straight
line, so it is known as straight line formula.
2. Parabolic formula. Prof. Johnson after proposing the straight line formula found that the
results obtained by this formula are very approximate. He then proposed another formula, according
to which the critical or crippling load,

 with usual notations.
If a curve of safe stress (Wcr / A) is plotted against (L / k), it works out to be a parabolic, so it is
known as parabolic formula.
Fig. 16.4 shows the relationship of safe stress (Wcr / A) and the slenderness ratio (L / k) as given
by Johnson’s formula and Euler’s formula for a column made of mild steel with both ends hinged
(i.e. C = 1), having a yield strength, σy = 210 MPa. We see from the figure that point A (the point of
tangency between the Johnson’s straight line formula and Euler’s formula) describes the use of two
formulae. In other words, Johnson’s straight line formula may be used when L / k < 180 and the
Euler’s formula is used when L / k > 180.

Similarly, the point B (the point of tangency between the Johnson’s parabolic formula and Euler’s
formula) describes the use of two formulae. In other words, Johnson’s parabolic formula is used when
L / k < 140 and the Euler’s formula is used when L / k > 140.
Note : For short columns made of ductile materials, the Johnson’s parabolic formula is used.

16.12 Long Columns Subjected to Eccentric Loading
In the previous articles, we have discussed the effect of loading on long columns. We have
always referred the cases when the load acts axially on the column (i.e. the line of action of the load
coincides with the axis of the column). But in actual practice it is not always possible to have an axial
load on the column, and eccentric loading takes place. Here we shall discuss the effect of eccentric
loading on the Rankine’s and Euler’s formula for long columns.
Consider a long column hinged at both ends and subjected to an eccentric load as shown in
Fig. 16.5.
Fig. 16.5. Long column subjected to eccentric loading.
Let
W = Load on the column,
A = Area of cross-section,
e = Eccentricity of the load,
Z = Section modulus,
yc = Distance of the extreme fibre (on compression side) from the axis of the
column,
k = Least radius of gyration,

E = Young’s modulus, and
l = Length of the column.

16.13 Design of Piston Rod
Since a piston rod moves forward and backward in the engine cylinder, therefore it is subjected
to alternate tensile and compressive forces. It is usually made of mild steel. One end of the piston rod
is secured to the piston by means of tapered rod provided with nut. The other end of the piston rod is
joined to crosshead by means of a cotter.

The diameter of the piston rod is obtained as discussed below:
1.
When the length of the piston rod is small i.e. when slenderness ratio (l / k) is less than 40,
then the diameter of piston rod may be obtained by equating the load acting on the piston
rod to its tensile strength, i.e.

When the length of the piston rod is large, then the diameter of the piston rod is obtained
by using Euler’s formula or Rankine’s formula. Since the piston rod is securely fastened

Example 16.3. Calculate the diameter of a piston rod for a cylinder of 1.5 m diameter in which
the greatest difference of steam pressure on the two sides of the piston may be assumed to be 0.2 N/mm2.
The rod is made of mild steel and is secured to the piston by a tapered rod and nut and to the crosshead
by a cotter. Assume modulus of elasticity as 200 kN/mm2 and factor of safety as 8. The length of rod
may be assumed as 3 metres.
Solution. Given : D = 1.5 m = 1500 mm ; p = 0.2 N/mm2 ; E = 200 kN/mm2 = 200 × 103 N/mm2 ;

l = Length of the push rod, and

Now using Euler’s formula, Wcr =

, the diameter of the push rod (D) can be obtained.
Notes: 1. Generally the diameter of the hole through the push rod is 0.8 times the diameter of push rod, i.e.
d = 0.8 D
2. Since the push rods are treated as pin end columns, therefore the equivalent length of the rod (L) is
equal to the actual length of the rod ( l ).
Example 16.4. The maximum load on a petrol engine push rod 300 mm long is 1400 N. It is
hollow having the outer diameter 1.25 times the inner diameter. Spherical seated bearings are used
for the push rod. The modulus of elasticity for the material of the push rod is 210 kN/mm2. Find a
suitable size for the push rod, taking a factor of safety of 2.5.
Solution. Given : l = 300 mm ; W = 1400 N ; D = 1.25 d ; E = 210 kN/mm2 = 210 × 103 N/mm2 ;
m = 2.5
Let
d = Inner diameter of push rod in mm, and
D = Outer diameter of the push rod in mm = 1.25 d
...(Given)
∴ Moment of inertia of the push rod section,

π  (D4 – d4) = 64
π  [(1.25 d)4 – d4] = 0.07 d4 mm4
We know that the crippling load on the push rod,

16.15 Design of Connecting Rod
A connecting rod is a machine member which is subjected to alternating direct compressive and
tensile forces. Since the compressive forces are much higher than the tensile forces, therefore the
cross-section of the connecting rod is designed as a strut and the Rankine’s formula is used.
A connecting rod subjected to an axial load W may buckle with X-axis as neutral axis (i.e. in the
plane of motion of the connecting rod) or Y-axis as neutral axis (i.e. in the plane perpendicular to the
plane of motion). The connecting rod is considered like both ends hinged for buckling about X-axis
and both ends fixed for buckling about Y-axis. A connecting rod should be equally strong in buckling
about either axes.
Let
A = Cross-sectional area of the connecting rod,
l = Length of the connecting rod,

This shows that the connecting rod is four
times strong in buckling about Y-axis than about
X-axis. If Ixx > 4 Iyy, then buckling will occur about
Y-axis and if Ixx < 4 Iyy, buckling will occur about
X-axis. In actual practice, Ixx is kept slightly less than
4 Iyy. It is usually taken between 3 and 3.5 and the
connecting rod is designed for buckling about X-axis.
The design will alwyas be satisfactory for buckling
about Y-axis.
The most suitable section for the connecting
rod is I-section with the proportions as shown in Fig.

 lies between 3 and 3.5, therefore I-section chosen is quite satisfactory.
Notes : 1. The I-section of the connecting rod is used due to its lightness and to keep the inertia forces as low as
possible. It can also withstand high gas pressure.
2. Sometimes a connecting rod may have rectangular section. For slow speed engines, circular sections
may be used.
3. Since connecting rod is manufactured by forging, therefore the sharp corners of I-section are rounded
off as shown in Fig. 16.7 (b) for easy removal of the section from the dies.
Example 16.5. A connecting rod of length l may be considered as a strut with the ends free to
turn on the crank pin and the gudgeon pin. In the directions of the axes of these pins, however, it may
be considered as having fixed ends. Assuming that Euler’s formula is applicable, determine the ratio
of the sides of the rectangular cross-section so that the connecting rod is equally strong in both
planes of buckling.
Solution. The rectangular cross-section of the connecting rod is shown in Fig. 16.8.

16.16  Forces Acting on a Connecting Rod
A connecting rod is subjected to the following forces :
1. Force due to gas or steam pressure and inertia of reciprocating parts, and
2. Inertia bending forces.
We shall now derive the expressions for the forces acting on a horizontal engine, as discussed
below:

1.  Force due to gas or steam pressure and inertia of reciprocating parts
Consider a connecting rod PC as shown in Fig. 16.9.

Let
p = Pressure of gas or steam,
A = Area of piston,
mR = Mass of reciprocating parts,
= Mass of piston, gudgeon pin etc. + 1
3  rd mass of connecting rod,
ω = Angular speed of crank,
φ = Angle of inclination of the connecting rod with the line of stroke,
θ = Angle of inclination of the crank from inner dead centre,
r = Radius of crank,
l = Length of connecting rod, and
n = Ratio of length of connecting rod to radius of crank = l / r.
We know that the force on the piston due to pressure of gas or steam,
FL = Pressure × Area = p × A
and inertia force of reciprocating parts,
FI = Mass × *Acceleration = mR × ω2 × r

It may be noted that in a horizontal engine, reciprocating parts are accelerated from rest during
the first half of the stroke (i.e. when the piston moves from inner dead centre to outer dead centre). It
is then retarted during the latter half of the stroke (i.e. when the piston moves from outer dead centre
to inner dead centre). The inertia force due to the acceleration of reciprocating parts, opposes the
force on the piston. On the other hand, the inertia force due to retardation of the reciprocating parts,
helps the force on the piston.
∴Net force acting on the piston pin (or gudgeon or wrist pin),
FP = Force due to pressure of gas or steam ± Inertia force
= FL ± FI
The –ve sign is used when the piston is accelerated and +ve sign is used when the piston is
retarted.

The force FP gives rise to a force FC in the connecting rod and a thrust FN on the sides of the
cylinder walls (or normal reaction on crosshead guides). From Fig. 16.9, we see that force in the

The force in the connecting rod will be maximum when the crank and the connecting rod are
perpendicular to each other (i.e. when θ =
90°). But at this position, the gas pressure
would be decreased considerably. Thus, for
all practical purposes, the force in the
connecting rod (FC) is taken equal to the
maximum force on the piston due to
pressure of gas or steam (FL), neglecting
piston inertia effects.
2. Inertia bending forces
Consider a connecting rod PC and a
crank OC rotating with uniform angular
velocity ω rad /s. In order to find the
acceleration of various points on the
connecting rod, draw the Klien’s
acceleration diagram CQNO as shown in
Fig. 16.10 (a). CO represents the
acceleration of C towards O and NO
represents the acceleration of P towards O.
The acceleration of other points such as D,
E, F and G etc. on the connecting rod PC
may be found by drawing horizontal lines
from these points to intersect CN at d, e, f
and g respectively. Now dO, eO, fO and
gO represents the acceleration of D, E, F
and G all towards O. The inertia force acting
on each point will be as follows :
Inertia force at C = m × ω2 × CO
Inertia force at D = m × ω2 × dO
Inertia force at E = m × ω2 × eO, and
so on.
The inertia forces will be opposite to
the direction of acceleration or centrifugal
forces. The inertia forces can be resolved into two components, one parallel to the connecting rod and
the other perpendicular to the rod. The parallel (or longitudinal) components adds up algebraically to
the force acting on the connecting rod (FC) and produces thrust on the pins. The perpendicular (or
transverse) components produces bending action (also called whipping action) and the stress induced
in the connecting rod is called whipping stress.

Fig. 16.10. Inertia bending forces.
A little consideration will show that the perpendicular components will be maximum, when the
crank and connecting rod are at right angles to each other.
The variation of the inertia force on the connecting rod is linear and is like a simply supported
beam of variable loading as shown in Fig. 16.10 (b) and (c). Assuming that the connecting rod is of
uniform cross-section and has mass m1 kg per unit length, therefore
Inertia force per unit length at the crank pin
= m1 × ω2r
and inertia force per unit length at the gudgeon pin
= 0

and the maximum bending stress, due to inertia of the connecting rod,

Z
where
Z = Section modulus.
From above we see that the maximum bending moment varies as the square of speed, therefore,
the bending stress due to high speed will be dangerous. It may be noted that the maximum axial force
and the maximum bending stress do not occur simultaneously. In an I.C. engine, the maximum gas
load occurs close to top dead centre whereas the maximum bending stress occurs when the crank
angle θ = 65° to 70° from top dead centre. The pressure of gas falls suddenly as the piston moves from
dead centre. In steam engines, even though the pressure is maintained till cut off occurs, the speed is
low and therefore the bending stress due to inertia is small. Thus the general practice is to design a
connecting rod by assuming the force in the connecting rod (FC) equal to the maximum force on the
piston due to pressure of gas or steam (FL), neglecting piston inertia effects and then checked for
bending stress due to inertia force (i.e. whipping stress).

17.1 Introduction
The power screws (also known as translation screws)
are used to convert rotary motion into translatory motion.
For example, in the case of the lead screw of lathe, the rotary
motion is available but the tool has to be advanced in the
direction of the cut against the cutting resistance of the
material. In case of screw jack, a small force applied in the
horizontal plane is used to raise or lower a large load. Power
screws are also used in vices, testing machines, presses,
etc.
In most of the power screws, the nut has axial motion
against the resisting axial force while the screw rotates in
its bearings. In some screws, the screw rotates and moves
axially against the resisting force while the nut is stationary
and in others the nut rotates while the screw moves axially
with no rotation.

17.2 Types of Screw Threads used for Power Screws
Following are the three types of screw threads mostly used for power screws :
1.  Square thread. A square thread, as shown in Fig. 17.1 (a), is adapted for the transmission of
power in either direction. This thread results in maximum efficiency and minimum radial or bursting
Fig. 17.1. Types of power screws.
pressure on the nut. It is difficult to cut with taps and dies. It is usually cut on a lathe with a single
point tool and it can not be easily compensated for wear. The
square threads are employed in screw jacks, presses and
clamping devices. The standard dimensions for square threads
according to IS : 4694 – 1968 (Reaffirmed 1996), are shown
in Table 17.1 to 17.3.
2.  Acme or trapezoidal thread. An acme or trapezoidal
thread, as shown in Fig. 17.1 (b), is a modification of square
thread. The slight slope given to its sides lowers the efficiency
slightly than square thread and it also introduce some bursting
pressure on the nut, but increases its area in shear. It is used
where a split nut is required and where provision is made to
take up wear as in the lead screw of a lathe. Wear may be
taken up by means of an adjustable split nut. An acme thread
may be cut by means of dies and hence it is more easily
manufactured than square thread. The standard dimensions
for acme or trapezoidal threads are shown in Table 17.4
(Page 630).
3. Buttress thread. A buttress thread, as shown in Fig.
17.1 (c), is used when large forces act along the screw axis in
one direction only. This thread combines the higher efficiency
of square thread and the ease of cutting and the adaptability to
a split nut of acme thread. It is stronger than other threads because of greater thickness at the base of
the thread. The buttress thread has limited use for power transmission. It is employed as the thread for
light jack screws and vices.

17.3 Multiple Threads
The power screws with multiple threads such as double, triple etc. are employed when it is
desired to secure a large lead with fine threads or high efficiency. Such type of threads are usually
found in high speed actuators.
17.4 Torque Required to Raise Load by Square Threaded Screws
The torque required to raise a load by means of square threaded screw may be determined  by
considering a screw jack as shown in Fig. 17.2 (a). The load to be raised or lowered is placed on the
head of the square threaded rod which is rotated by the application of an effort at the end of lever for
lifting or lowering the load.
Fig. 17.2
A little consideration will show that if one complete turn of a screw thread be imagined to be
unwound, from the body of the screw and developed, it will form an inclined plane as shown in
Fig. 17.3 (a).

P = Effort applied at the circumference of the screw to lift the load,
W = Load to be lifted, and
μ = Coefficient of friction, between the screw and nut
= tan φ, where φ is the friction angle.
From the geometry of the Fig. 17.3 (a), we find that
tan α = p / π d
Since the principle, on which a screw jack works is similar to that of an inclined plane, therefore
the force applied on the circumference of a screw jack may be considered to be horizontal as shown
in Fig. 17.3 (b).
Since the load is being lifted, therefore the force of friction (F = μ.RN ) will act downwards. All
the forces acting on the body are shown in Fig. 17.3 (b).
Resolving the forces along the plane,
P cos α = W sin α + F = W sin α + μ.RN
...(i)
and resolving the forces perpendicular to the plane,
RN = P sin α + W cos α
...(ii)
Substituting this value of RN in equation (i), we have
P cos α = W sin α + μ (P sin α + W cos α)
= W sin α + μ P sin α + μW cos α
or
P cos α – μ P sin α = W sin α + μW cos α

17.5 Torque Required to Lower Load by
Square Threaded Screws
A little consideration will show that when the load
is being lowered, the force of friction (F = μ.RN) will
act upwards. All the forces acting on the body are shown
in Fig. 17.4.
Resolving the forces along the plane,
       P cos α = F – W sin α
= μ RN – W sin α
..(i)
and resolving the forces perpendicular to the plane,
            RN = W cos α – P sin α
..(ii)
Substituting this value of RN in equation (i), we have,
P cos α = μ (W cos α – P sin α) – W sin α
= μ W cos α – μ P sin α – W sin α
or
P cos α + μ P sin α = μW cos α – W sin α

17.6 Efficiency of Square Threaded Screws
The efficiency of square threaded screws may be defined as the ratio between the ideal effort
(i.e. the effort required to move the load, neglecting friction) to the actual effort (i.e. the effort re-
quired to move the load taking friction into account).
We have seen in Art. 17.4 that the effort applied at the circumference of the screw to lift the
load is
                          P = W tan (α + φ)
...(i)
where                          W = Load to be lifted,
                           α = Helix angle,
                            φ = Angle of friction, and
                             μ = Coefficient of friction between the screw and nut = tan φ.
If there would have been no friction between the screw and the nut, then φ will be equal to zero.
The value of effort P0 necessary to raise the load, will then be given by the equation,
                          P0 = W tan α
[Substituting φ = 0 in equation (i)]

Example 17.1. A vertical screw with single start square threads of 50 mm mean diameter and
12.5 mm pitch is raised against a load of 10 kN by means of a hand wheel, the boss of which is
threaded to act as a nut. The axial load is taken up by a thrust collar which supports the wheel boss
and has a mean diameter of 60 mm. The coefficient of friction is 0.15 for the screw and 0.18 for the
collar. If the tangential force applied by each hand to the wheel is 100 N, find suitable diameter of the
hand wheel.
Solution. Given : d = 50 mm ; p = 12.5 mm ; W = 10 kN = 10 × 103N ; D = 60 mm or

Example 17.5. The mean diameter of the square threaded screw having pitch of 10 mm is
50 mm. A load of 20 kN is lifted through a distance of 170 mm. Find the work done in lifting the load
and the efficiency of the screw, when
1.
The load rotates with the screw, and
2.
The load rests on the loose head which does not rotate with the screw.
The external and internal diameter of the bearing surface of the loose head are 60 mm and 10 mm
respectively. The coefficient of friction for the screw and the bearing surface may be taken as 0.08.
Solution. Given : p = 10 mm ; d = 50 mm ; W = 20 kN = 20 × 103 N ; D1 = 60 mm or

17.8 Efficiency Vs Helix Angle
We have seen in Art. 17.6 that the efficiency of a square threaded screw depends upon the helix
angle α and the friction angle φ. The variation of efficiency of a square threaded screw for raising the
load with the helix angle α is shown in Fig. 17.5. We see that the efficiency of a square threaded screw
increases rapidly upto helix angle of 20°, after which the increase in efficiency is slow. The efficiency
is maximum for helix angle between 40 to 45°.
Fig. 17.5. Graph between efficiency and helix angle.
 When the helix angle further increases say 70°, the efficiency drops. This is due to the fact that
the normal thread force becomes large and thus the force of friction and the work of friction becomes
large as compared with the useful work. This results in low efficiency.
17.9 Over Hauling and Self Locking Screws
We have seen in Art. 17.5 that the effort required at the circumference of the screw to lower the
load is
                              P = W tan (φ – α)

In the above expression, if φ < α, then torque required to lower the load will be negative. In
other words, the load will start moving downward without the application of any torque. Such a
condition is known as over hauling of screws. If however, φ > α, the torque required to lower the load
will be positive, indicating that an effort is applied to lower the load. Such a screw is known as

self locking screw. In other words, a screw will be self locking if the friction angle is greater than
helix angle or coefficient of friction is greater than tangent of helix angle i.e. μ or tan φ > tan α.

17.11 Coefficient of Friction
The coefficient of friction depends upon various factors like *material of screw and nut, work-
manship in cutting screw, quality of lubrication, unit bearing pressure and the rubbing speeds. The
value of coefficient of friction does not vary much with different combination of material, load or
rubbing speed, except under starting conditions. The coefficient of friction, with good lubrication and
average workmanship, may be assumed between 0.10 and 0.15. The various values for coefficient of
friction for steel screw and cast iron or bronze nut, under different conditions are shown in the follow-
ing table.

17.12 Acme or Trapezoidal Threads
We know that the normal reaction in case of a square
threaded screw is
         RN = W cos α,
where α is the helix angle.
But in case of Acme or trapezoidal thread, the normal re-
action between the screw and nut is increased because the axial
component of this normal reaction must be equal to the axial
load (W ).
Consider an Acme or trapezoidal thread as shown in
Fig. 17.6.
Let
 **2β = Angle of the Acme thread, and
β = Semi-angle of the thread.
Fig. 17.6. Acme or trapeonidal  threads.
**
For Acme threads, 2 β = 29°, and for trapezoidal threads, 2 β = 30°.
*
The material of screw is usually steel and the nut is made of cast iron, gun metal, phosphor bronze in order
to keep the wear to a mininum.

Notes : 1. When coefficient of friction, μ1 = cos

β  is considered, then the Acme thread is equivalent to a square
thread.
2. All equations of square threaded screw also hold good for Acme threads. In case of Acme threads, μ1
(i.e. tan φ1) may be substituted in place of μ (i.e. tan φ). Thus for Acme threads,
P = W tan (α + φ1)
where
 φ1 = Virtual friction angle, and tan φ1 = μ1.
Example 17.6. The lead screw of a lathe has Acme threads of 50 mm outside diameter and
8 mm pitch. The screw must exert an axial pressure of 2500 N in order to drive the tool carriage. The
thrust is carried on a collar 110 mm outside diameter and 55 mm inside diameter and the lead screw
rotates at 30 r.p.m. Determine (a) the power required to drive the screw; and (b) the efficiency of the
lead screw. Assume a coefficient of friction of 0.15 for the screw and 0.12 for the collar.
Solution. Given : do = 50 mm ; p = 8 mm ; W = 2500 N ; D1 = 110 mm or R1 = 55 mm ;
D2 = 55 mm or R2 = 27.5 mm ; N = 30 r.p.m. ; μ = tan φ = 0.15 ; μ2 = 0.12

17.13 Stresses in Power Screws
A power screw must have adequate strength to withstand axial load and the applied torque.
Following types of stresses are induced in the screw.
1. Direct tensile or compressive stress due to an axial load. The direct stress due to the axial
load may be determined by dividing the axial load (W) by the minimum cross-sectional area of the
screw (Ac) i.e. area corresponding to minor or core diameter (dc ).
∴Direct stress (tensile or compressive)
=
c
W
A
This is only applicable when the axial load is compressive and the unsupported length of the
screw between the load and the nut is short. But when the screw is axially loaded in compression and
the unsupported length of the screw between the load and the nut is too great, then the design must be
based on column theory assuming suitable end conditions. In such cases, the cross-sectional area
corresponding to core diameter may be obtained by using Rankine-Gordon formula or J.B. Johnson’s
formula. According to this,
Wcr =

where
Wcr = Critical load,
σy = Yield stress,
L = Length of screw,
k = Least radius of gyration,
C = End-fixity coefficient,
E = Modulus of elasticity, and
σc = Stress induced due to load W.
Note : In actual practice, the core diameter is first obtained by considering the screw under simple compression
and then checked for critical load or buckling load for stability of the screw.
2. Torsional shear stress. Since the screw is subjected to a twisting moment, therefore torsional
shear stress is induced. This is obtained by considering the minimum cross-section of the screw. We
know that torque transmitted by the screw,
T =

When the screw is subjected to both direct stress and torsional shear stress, then the design must
be based on maximum shear stress theory, according to which maximum shear stress on the minor
diameter section,
               τmax =

It may be noted that when the unsupported length of the screw is short, then failure will take
place when the maximum shear stress is equal to the shear yield strength of the material. In this case,
shear yield strength,
                  τy  =  τmax × Factor of safety
3. Shear stress due to axial load. The threads of the
screw at the core or root diameter and the threads of the nut
at the major diameter may shear due to the axial load.
Assuming that the load is uniformly distributed over the
threads in contact, we have

4. Bearing pressure. In order to reduce wear of the screw and nut, the bearing pressure on the
thread surfaces must be within limits. In the design of power screws, the bearing pressure depends
upon the materials of the screw and nut, relative velocity between the nut and screw and the nature of
lubrication. Assuming that the load is uniformly distributed over the threads in contact, the bearing
pressure on the threads is given by

Example 17.7. A power screw having double start square threads of 25 mm nominal diameter
and 5 mm pitch is acted upon by an axial load of 10 kN. The outer and inner diameters of screw
collar are 50 mm and 20 mm respectively. The coefficient of thread friction and collar friction may
be assumed as 0.2 and 0.15 respectively. The screw rotates at 12 r.p.m. Assuming uniform wear
condition at the collar and allowable thread bearing pressure of 5.8 N/mm2, find: 1. the torque
required to rotate the screw; 2. the stress in the screw; and 3. the number of threads of nut in engagement
with screw.
Solution. Given : do = 25 mm ; p = 5 mm ; W = 10 kN = 10 × 103 N ; D1 = 50 mm or
R1 = 25 mm ; D2 = 20 mm or R2 = 10 mm ; μ = tan φ = 0.2 ; μ1 = 0.15 ; N = 12 r.p.m. ; pb = 5.8 N/mm2
1. Torque required to rotate the screw
We know that mean diameter of the screw,
d = do – p / 2 = 25 – 5 / 2 = 22.5 mm

screws, as shown in Fig. 17.8. The frictional resistance induced by water pressure against the gate
when it is in its lowest position is 4000 N.
The outside diameter of the screw is 60 mm and pitch is 10 mm. The outside and inside diameter
of washer is 150 mm and 50 mm respectively. The coefficient
of friction between the screw and nut is 0.1 and for the
washer and seat is 0.12. Find :
1. The maximum force to be exerted at the ends of
the lever raising and lowering the gate,2. Efficiency of the

Example 17.10. The screw, as shown in Fig. 17.9 is operated by a torque applied to the lower
end. The nut is loaded and prevented from turning by guides. Assume friction in the ball bearing to
be negligible. The screw is a triple start trapezoidal thread. The outside
diameter of the screw is 48 mm and pitch is 8 mm. The coefficient of
friction of the threads is 0.15. Find :
1. Load which can be raised by a torque of 40 N-m ;
2. Whether the screw is overhauling ; and
3. Average bearing pressure between the screw and nut thread
surface.
Solution. Given : do = 48 mm ; p = 8 mm ; μ = tan φ = 0.15 ;
T = 40 N-m = 40 000 N-mm
1.  Load which can be raised
Let

We have discussed in Art. 17.9 that if φ1 is less than α, then the torque required to lower the load
will be negative, i.e. the load will start moving downward without the application of any torque. Such
a condition is known as overhauling of screws.
In the present case, tan φ1 = 0.155 and tan α = 0.174. Since φ1 is less than α, therefore the screw
is overhauling.

Example 17.11. A C-clamp, as shown in Fig. 17.10, has
trapezoidal threads of 12 mm outside diameter and 2 mm pitch. The
coefficient of friction for screw threads is 0.12 and for the collar is
0.25. The mean radius of the collar is 6 mm. If the force exerted by
the operator at the end of the handle is 80 N, find: 1. The length of
handle; 2. The maximum shear stress in the body of the screw and
where does this exist; and 3. The bearing pressure on the threads.
Solution. Given : do = 12 mm ; p = 2 mm ; μ = tan φ = 0.12 ;
μ2 = 0.25 ; R = 6 mm ; P1 = 80 N ; W = 4 kN = 4000 N

2. Maximum shear stress in the body of the screw
Consider two sections A-A and B-B. The section A-A just above the nut, is subjected to torque
and bending. The section B-B just below the nut is subjected to collar friction torque and direct
compressive load. Thus, both the sections must be checked for maximum shear stress.

Example 17.13. A vertical two start square threaded screw of 100 mm mean diameter and 20
mm pitch supports a vertical load of 18 kN. The nut of the screw is fitted in the hub of a gear wheel
having 80 teeth which meshes with a pinion of 20 teeth. The mechanical efficiency of the pinion and
gear wheel drive is 90 percent. The axial thrust on the screw is taken by a collar bearing 250 mm
outside diameter and 100 mm inside diameter. Assuming uniform pressure conditions, find, mini-
mum diameter of pinion shaft and height of nut, when coefficient of friction for the vertical screw and
nut is 0.15 and that for the collar bearing is 0.20. The permissible shear stress in the shaft material
is 56 MPa and allowable bearing pressure is 1.4 N/mm2.
Solution. Given : d = 100 mm ; p = 20 mm ; W = 18 kN = 18 × 103N ; No. of teeth on gear wheel
= 80 ; No. of teeth on pinion = 20 ; ηm = 90% = 0.9 ; D1 = 250 mm or R1 = 125 mm ; D2 = 100 mm or
R2 = 50 mm ; μ = tan φ = 0.15 ; μ1 = 0.20 ; τ = 56 MPa = 56 N/mm2 ; pb = 1.4 N/mm2

Example 17.14. A screw press is to exert a force of 40 kN. The unsupported length of the screw
is 400 mm. Nominal diameter of screw is 50 mm. The screw has square threads with pitch equal to 10
mm. The material of the screw and nut are medium carbon steel and cast iron respectively. For the
steel used take ultimate crushing stress as 320 MPa, yield stress in tension or compression as 200
MPa and that in shear as 120 MPa. Allowable shear stress for cast iron is 20 MPa and allowable
bearing pressure between screw and nut is 12 N/mm2. Young's modulus for steel = 210 kN/mm2.
Determine the factor of safety of screw against failure. Find the dimensions of the nut. What is the
efficiency of the arrangement? Take coefficient of friction between steel and cast iron as 0.13.
Solution. Given : W = 40 kN = 40 × 103 N ; L = 400 mm = 0.4 m ; do = 50 mm ; p = 10 mm ;
σcu = 320 MPa = 320 N/mm2 ; σy = 200 MPa = 200 N/mm2 ; τy = 120 MPa = 120 N/mm2 ;
τc = 20 MPa = 20 N/mm2 ; pb = 12 N/mm2 ; E = 210 kN/mm2 = 210 × 103 N/mm2 ; μ = tan φ = 0.13

17.14 Design of Screw Jack
A bottle screw jack for lifting loads is shown in Fig. 17.11. The various parts of the screw jack
are as follows:
1.
 Screwed spindle having square threaded screws,
2.
Nut and collar for nut,
3.
Head at the top of the screwed spindle for handle,
4.
Cup at the top of head for the load, and
5.
Body of the screw jack.
In order to design a screw jack for a load W, the following procedure may be adopted:

Assuming that a person can apply a force of 300 – 400 N intermittently, the length of handle
required

The buckling load as obtained by the above expression must be
higher than the load at which the screw is designed.
13. Fix the dimensions for the body of the screw jack.
14. Find efficiency of the screw jack.
Example 17.15. A screw jack is to lift a load of 80 kN through a
height of 400 mm. The elastic strength of screw material in tension and
compression is 200 MPa and in shear 120 MPa. The material for nut is
phosphor-bronze for which the elastic limit may be taken as 100 MPa in
tension, 90 MPa in compression and 80 MPa in shear. The bearing
pressure between the nut and the screw is not to exceed 18 N/mm2. Design
and draw the screw jack. The design should include the design of 1.
screw, 2. nut, 3. handle and cup,and 4. body.

Since these maximum stresses are within limits, therefore design of screw for spindle is safe.
2. Design for nut
Let
 n = Number of threads in contact with the screwed spindle,
h = Height of nut = n × p, and
t = Thickness of screw = p / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 mm
Assume that the load is distributed uniformly over the cross-sectional area of nut.

Now, let us check the stresses induced in the screw and nut.

3. Design for handle and cup
The diameter of the head (D3) on the top of the screwed rod is usually taken as 1.75 times the
outside diameter of the screw (do).
∴
D3 = 1.75 do = 1.75 × 46 = 80.5 say 82 mm Ans.
The head is provided with two holes at the right angles to receive the handle for rotating the
screw. The seat for the cup is made equal to the diameter of head, i.e. 82 mm and it is given chamfer
at the top. The cup prevents the load from rotating. The cup is fitted to the head with a pin of diameter
D4 = 20 mm. The pin remains loose fit in the cup. Other dimensions for the cup may be taken as
follows :
Height of cup = 50 mm Ans.
Thickness of cup = 10 mm Ans.
Diameter at the top of cup = 160 mm Ans.
Now let us find out the torque required (T2) to overcome friction at the top of the screw.
Assuming uniform pressure conditions, we have

∴Total torque to which the handle is subjected,
T = T1 + T2 = 340 × 103 + 321 × 103 = 661 × 103 N-mm
Assuming that a force of 300 N is applied by a person intermittently, therefore length of handle
required
= 661 × 103 / 300 = 2203 mm
Allowing some length for gripping, we shall take the length of handle as 2250 mm.

A little consideration will show that an excessive force applied at the end of lever will cause
bending. Considering bending effect, the maximum bending moment on the handle,
M = Force applied × Length of lever
= 300 × 2250 = 675 × 103 N-mm
Let
 D = Diameter of the handle.
Assuming that the material of the handle is same as that of screw, therefore taking bending
stress σb = σt = σet / 2 = 100 N/mm2.
We know that the bending moment (M),

D3 = 675 × 103 / 9.82 = 68.74 × 103    or   D = 40.96 say 42 mm Ans.
The height of head (H) is taken as 2D.
∴
H = 2 D = 2 × 42 = 84 mm
Ans.
Now let us check the screw for buckling load.
We know that the effective length for the buckling of screw,
L = Lift of screw +  1
2  Height of nut = H1 + h / 2
= 400 + 80 / 2 = 440 mm
When the screw reaches the maximum lift, it can be regarded as a strut whose lower end is fixed
and the load end is free. We know that critical load,

... (Taking σy = σet)

Since the critical load is more than the load at which the screw is designed (i.e. 80 × 103 N),
therefore there is no chance of the screw to buckle.
4. Design of body
The various dimensions of the body may be fixed as follows:
Diameter of the body at the top,
D5 = 1.5 D2 = 1.5 × 82 = 123 mm Ans.
Thickness of the body,
t3 = 0.25 do = 0.25 × 46 = 11.5 say 12 mm Ans.

Example 17.16. A toggle jack as shown in Fig. 17.12, is to be designed for lifting a load of
4 kN. When the jack is in the top position, the distance between the centre lines of nuts is 50 mm and
in the bottom position this distance is 210 mm. The eight links of the jack are symmetrical and 110
mm long. The link pins in the base are set 30 mm apart. The links, screw and pins are made from mild
steel for which the permissible stresses are 100 MPa in tension and 50 MPa in shear. The bearing
pressure on the pins is limited to 20 N/mm2.
Assume the pitch of the square threads as 6 mm and the coefficient of friction between threads
as 0.20.
Fig. 17.12
Solution. Given : W = 4 kN = 4000 N ; l = 110 mm ; σt = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2 ; τ = 50 MPa
= 50 N/mm2 ;  pb = 20 N/mm2 ;  p = 6 mm ; μ = tan φ = 0.20
The toggle jack may be designed as discussed below :
1. Design of square threaded screw
A little consideration will show that the maximum load on the square threaded screw occurs
when the jack is in the bottom position. The position of the link CD in the bottom position is shown
in Fig. 17.13 (a).
Let θ be the angle of inclination of the link CD with the horizontal.

Each nut carries half the total load on the jack and due to this, the link CD is subjected to tension
while the square threaded screw is under pull as shown in Fig. 17.13 (b). The magnitude of the pull on
the square threaded screw is given by
                                       F  = 2 tan

Since a similar pull acts on the other nut, therefore
total tensile pull on the square threaded rod,
W1 = 2F = 2 × 2846 = 5692 N

We know that load on the screw (W1),

Since the screw is also subjected to torsional shear stress, therefore to account for this, let us
adopt
dc = 14 mm Ans.
∴Nominal or outer diameter of the screw,
do = dc + p = 14 + 6 = 20 mm  Ans.
and mean diameter of the screw,

therefore bearing pressure between the threads ( pb ),

∴
n = 35.5 / 20 = 1.776
In order to have good stability and also to prevent rocking of the screw in the nut, we shall
provide n = 4 threads in the nut. The thickness of the nut,
t = n × p = 4 × 6 = 24 mm
Ans.
The width of the nut (b) is taken as 1.5 do.
∴
b = 1.5 do = 1.5 × 20 = 30 mm Ans.
To control the movement of the nuts beyond 210 mm (the maximum distance between the
centre lines of nuts), rings of 8 mm thickness are fitted on the screw with the help of set screws.
∴ Length of screwed portion of the screw
= 210 + t + 2 × Thickness of rings
= 210 + 24 + 2 × 8 = 250 mm Ans.
The central length (about 25 mm) of screwed rod is kept equal to core diameter of the screw i.e.
14 mm. Since the toggle jack is operated by means of spanners on both sides of the square threaded
rod, therefore the ends of the rod may be reduced to 10 mm square and 15 mm long.
∴Toal length of the screw
= 250 + 2 × 15 = 280 mm Ans.
Assuming that a force of 150 N is applied by each person at each end of the rod, therefore length
of the spanner required
                                  =

3. Design of pins in the nuts
Let
 d1 = Diameter of pins in the nuts.
Since the pins are in double shear, therefore load on the pins (F ),

∴

The diameter of pin head is taken as 1.5 d1 (i.e. 12 mm) and thickness 4 mm. The pins in the nuts
are kept in position by separate rings 4 mm thick and 1.5 mm split pins passing through the rings and
pins.
4. Design of links
Due to the load, the links may buckle in two planes at right angles to each other. For buckling in
the vertical plane (i.e. in the plane of the links), the links are considered as hinged at both ends and for
buckling in a plane perpendicular to the vertical plane, it is considered as fixed at both ends. We know
that load on the link
= F / 2 = 2846 / 2 = 1423 N
Assuming a factor of safety = 5, the links must be designed for a buckling load of
Wcr = 1423 × 5 = 7115 N
Let
 t1 = Thickness of the link, and
b1 = Width of the link.
Assuming that the width of the link is three times the thickness of the link, i.e. b1 = 3 t1, therefore
cross-sectional area of the link,
A = t1 × 3t1 = 3(t1)2

for buckling in a plane perpendicular to the vertical plane.

17.15 Differential and Compound Screws
There are certain cases in which a very slow movement of the screw is required whereas in other
cases, a very fast movement of the screw is needed. The slow movement of the screw may be obtained
by using a small pitch of the threads, but it results in weak threads. The fast movement of the screw
may be obtained by using multiple-start threads, but this method requires expensive machning and
the loss of self-locking property. In order to overcome these difficulties, differential or compound
screws, as discussed below, are used.
1. Differential screw. When a slow movement or fine adjustment is desired in precision
equipments, then a differential screw is used. It consists of two threads of the same hand (i.e. right
handed or left handed) but of different pitches, wound on the same cylinder or different cylinders as
shown in Fig. 17.14. It may be noted that when the threads are wound on the same cylinder, then two

nuts are employed as shown in Fig. 17.14 (a) and when the threads are wound on different cylinders,
then only one nut is employed as shown in Fig. 17.14 (b).
Fig. 17.14
In this case, each revolution of the screw causes the nuts to move towards or away from each
other by a distance equal to the difference of the pitches.
Let
 p1 = Pitch of the upper screw,
d1 = Mean diameter of the upper screw,
α1 = Helix angle of the upper screw, and
μ1 = Coefficient of friction between the upper screw and the upper nut

2. Compound screw. When a fast movement is desired, then a compound screw is employed. It
consists of two threads of opposite hands (i.e. one right handed and the other left handed) wound on
the same cylinder or different cylinders, as shown in Fig. 17.15 (a) and (b) respectively.
In this case, each revolution of the screw causes the nuts to move towards one another equal to
the sum of the pitches of the threads. Usually the pitch of both the threads are made equal.

Example 17.17. A differential screw jack is to be
made as shown in Fig. 17.16. Neither screw rotates. The
outside screw diameter is 50 mm. The screw threads are
of square form single start and the coefficient of thread
friction is 0.15.
Determine : 1. Efficiency of the screw jack; 2. Load

screw is limited to 28 MPa.
Solution. Given : do = 50 mm ; μ = tan φ = 0.15 ;
p1 = 16 mm ; p2 = 12 mm ; τmax = 28 MPa = 28 N/mm2

We know that the mean diameter of the upper screw,

2. Load that can be lifted
Since the upper screw is subjected to a larger torque, therefore the load to be lifted (W) will be
calculated on the basis of larger torque (T1).
We know that core diameter of the upper screw,
dc1 = do – p1 = 50 – 16 = 34 mm
Since the screw is subjected to direct compressive stress due to load W and shear stress due to
torque T1, therefore

18.1 Introduction
The belts or *ropes are used to transmit power from
one shaft to another by means of pulleys which rotate at the
same speed or at different speeds. The amount of power
transmitted depends upon the following factors :
1. The velocity of the belt.
2. The tension under which the belt is placed on the
pulleys.
3. The arc of contact between the belt and the smaller
pulley.
4. The conditions under which the belt is used.
It may be noted that
(a) The shafts should be properly in line to insure uniform
tension across the belt section.
(b) The pulleys should not be too close together, in order
that the arc of contact on the smaller pulley may be
as large as possible.

(c) The pulleys should not be so far apart as to cause the belt to weigh heavily on the shafts,
thus increasing the friction load on the bearings.
(d) A long belt tends to swing from side to side, causing the belt to run out of the pulleys, which
in turn develops crooked spots in the belt.
(e) The tight side of the belt should be at the bottom, so that whatever sag is present on the
loose side will increase the arc of contact at the pulleys.
( f ) In order to obtain good results with flat belts, the maximum distance between the shafts
should not exceed 10 metres and the minimum should not be less than 3.5 times the diameter
of the larger pulley.
18.2 Selection of a Belt Drive
Following are the various important factors upon which the selection of a belt drive depends:
1. Speed of the driving and driven shafts,
2.
Speed reduction ratio,
3. Power to be transmitted,
4.
Centre distance between the shafts,
5. Positive drive requirements,
6.
Shafts layout,
7. Space available, and
8.
Service conditions.
18.3 Types of Belt Drives
The belt drives are usually classified into the following three groups:
1. Light drives. These are used to transmit small powers at belt speeds upto about 10 m/s as in
agricultural machines and small machine tools.
2. Medium drives. These are used to transmit medium powers at belt speeds over 10 m/s but
up to 22 m/s, as in machine tools.
3. Heavy drives. These are used to transmit large powers at belt speeds above 22 m/s as in
compressors and generators.
18.4 Types of Belts
Though there are many types of belts used these days, yet the following are important from the
subject point of view:
1. Flat belt. The flat belt as shown in Fig. 18.1 (a), is mostly used in the factories and work-
shops, where a moderate amount of power is to be transmitted, from one pulley to another when the
two pulleys are not more than 8 metres apart.

2. V- belt. The V-belt as shown in Fig. 18.1 (b), is mostly used in the factories and workshops,
where a great amount of power is to be transmitted, from one pulley to another, when the two pulleys
are very near to each other.
3. Circular belt or rope. The circular belt or rope as shown in Fig. 18.1 (c) is mostly used in the
factories and workshops, where a great amount of power is to be transmitted, from one pulley to
another, when the two pulleys are more than 8 metres apart.

Top
Flat Belt Drives     679
If a huge amount of power is to be transmitted, then a single belt may not be sufficient. In such
a case, wide pulleys (for V-belts or circular belts) with a number of grooves are used. Then a belt in
each groove is provided to transmit the required amount of power from one pulley to another.
Note : The V-belt and rope drives are discussed in Chapter 20.
18.5 Material used for Belts
The material used for belts and ropes must be strong, flexible, and durable. It must have a high
coefficient of friction. The belts, according to the material used, are classified as follows:
1. Leather belts. The most important material for flat belt is leather. The best leather belts are
made from 1.2 metres to 1.5 metres long strips cut from either side of the back bone of the top grade
steer hides. The hair side of the leather is smoother and harder than the flesh side, but the flesh side is
stronger. The fibres on the hair side are perpendicular to the surface, while those on the flesh side are
interwoven and parallel to the surface. Therefore for these reasons the hair side of a belt should be in
contact with the pulley surface as shown in Fig. 18.2. This gives a more intimate contact between belt
and pulley and places the greatest tensile strength of the belt section on the outside, where the tension
is maximum as the belt passes over the pulley.
The leather may be either oak-tanned or mineral salt-tanned e.g. chrome-tanned. In order to
increase the thickness of belt, the strips are cemented together. The belts are specified according to
the number of layers e.g. single, double or triple ply and according to the thickness of hides used e.g.
light, medium or heavy.
( ) Single layer belt.
a
( ) Double layer belt.

Fig. 18.2. Leather belts.
The leather belts must be periodically cleaned and dressed or treated with a compound or
dressing containing neats foot or other suitable oils so that the belt will remain soft and flexible.
2. Cotton or fabric belts. Most of the fabric belts are made by folding convass or cotton duck
to three or more layers (depending upon the thickness desired) and stitching together. These belts are
woven also into a strip of the desired width and thickness. They are impregnated with some filler like
linseed oil in order to make the belt water-proof and to prevent injury to the fibres. The cotton belts
are cheaper and suitable in warm climates, in damp atmospheres and in exposed positions. Since the
cotton belts require little attention, therefore these belts are mostly used in farm machinery, belt
conveyor etc.
3. Rubber belt. The rubber belts are made of layers of fabric impregnated with rubber
composition and have a thin layer of rubber on the faces. These belts are very flexible but are quickly
destroyed if allowed to come into contact with heat, oil or grease. One of the principle advantage of
these belts is that they may be easily made endless. These belts are found suitable for saw mills, paper
mills where they are exposed to moisture.
4. Balata belts. These belts are similar to rubber belts except that balata gum is used in place of
rubber. These belts are acid proof and water proof and it is not effected by animal oils or alkalies. The
balata belts should not be at temperatures above 40°C because at this temperature the balata begins to
soften and becomes sticky. The strength of balata belts is 25 per cent higher than rubber belts.

18.6 Working Stresses in Belts
The ultimate strength of leather belt varies from 21 to 35 MPa and a factor of safety may be
taken as 8 to 10. However, the wear life of a belt is more important than actual strength. It has been
shown by experience that under average conditions an allowable stress of 2.8 MPa or less will give
a reasonable belt life. An allowable stress of 1.75 MPa may be expected to give a belt life of about
15 years.
18.7 Density of Belt Materials
The density of various belt materials are given in the following table.

18.8 Belt Speed
A little consideration will show that when the speed of belt increases, the centrifugal force also
increases which tries to pull the belt away from the pulley. This will result in the decrease of power
transmitted by the belt. It has been found that for the efficient transmission of power, the belt speed
20 m/s to 22.5 m/s may be used.
18.9 Coefficient of Friction Between Belt and Pulley
The coefficient of friction
between the belt and the pulley
depends upon the following factors:
1. The material of belt;
2. The material of pulley;
3. The slip of belt; and
4. The speed of belt.
According to C.G. Barth, the
coefficient of friction (μ) for oak
tanned leather belts on cast iron
pulley, at the point of slipping, is
given by the following relation, i.e.
          μ = 
42.6
0.54 – 152.6
v
+
where v = Speed of the belt  in metres per minute.

pulley.

18.10 Standard Belt Thicknesses and Widths
The standard flat belt thicknesses are 5, 6.5, 8, 10 and 12 mm. The preferred values of thicknesses
are as follows:
(a) 5 mm for nominal belt widths of 35 to 63 mm,
(b) 6.5 mm for nominal belt widths of 50 to 140 mm,
(c) 8 mm for nominal belt widths of 90 to 224 mm,
(d) 10 mm for nominal belt widths of 125 to 400 mm, and
(e) 12 mm for nominal belt widths of 250 to 600 mm.
The standard values of nominal belt widths are in R10 series, starting from 25 mm upto 63 mm
and in R 20 series starting from 71 mm up to 600 mm. Thus, the standard widths will be 25, 32, 40,
50, 63, 71, 80, 90, 100, 112, 125, 140, 160, 180, 200, 224, 250, 280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560 and
600 mm.
18.11 Belt Joints
When the endless belts are not available, then the belts are cut from big rolls and the ends are
joined together by fasteners. The various types of joints are
1. Cemented joint,
2. Laced joint, and
3.
Hinged joint.
The cemented joint, as shown in Fig. 18.3 (a), made by the manufacturer to form an endless
belt, is preferred than other joints. The laced joint is formed by punching holes in line across the belt,
leaving a margin between the edge and the holes. A raw hide strip is used for lacing the two ends
together to form a joint. This type of joint is known as straight-stitch raw hide laced joint, as shown
in Fig. 18.3 (b).
Metal laced joint as shown in Fig. 18.3 (c), is made like a staple connection. The points are
driven through the flesh side of the belt and clinched on the inside.
Sometimes, metal hinges may be fastened to the belt ends and connected by a steel or fibre pin
as shown in Fig. 18.3 (d).

18.12 Types of Flat Belt Drives
The power from one pulley to another may be transmitted by any of the following types of belt
drives.
Cross or twist belt drive
Contents
Top
Flat Belt Drives     683
1. Open belt drive. The open belt drive, as shown in Fig. 18.4, is used with shafts arranged
parallel and rotating in the same direction. In this case, the driver A pulls the belt from one side (i.e.
lower side RQ) and delivers it to the other side (i.e. upper side LM). Thus the tension in the lower side
belt will be more than that in the upper side belt. The lower side belt (because of more tension) is
known as tight side whereas the upper side belt (because of less tension) is known as slack side, as
shown in Fig. 18.4.
Fig. 18.4. Open belt drive.
2. Crossed or twist belt drive. The crossed or twist belt drive, as shown in Fig. 18.5, is used with
shafts arranged parallel and rotating in the opposite directions. In this case, the driver pulls  the belt
from one side (i.e. RQ) and delivers it to the other side (i.e. LM). Thus, the tension in the belt RQ will
be more than that in the belt LM. The belt RQ (because of more tension) is known as tight side,
whereas the belt LM (because of less tension) is known as slack side, as shown in Fig. 18.5.
A little consideration will show that at a point where the belt crosses, it rubs against each other
and there will be excessive wear and tear. In order to avoid this, the shafts should be placed at a
Fig. 18.5. Crossed or twist belt drive.

maximum distance of 20 b, where b is the width of belt and the speed of the belt should be less than
15 m/s.
3.  Quarter turn belt drive. The quarter turn belt drive (also known as right angle belt drive) as
shown in Fig. 18.6 (a), is used with shafts arranged at right angles and rotating in one definite direction.
In order to prevent the belt from leaving the pulley, the width of the face of the pulley should be
greater or equal to 1.4 b, where b is width of belt.
In case the pulleys cannot be arranged as shown in Fig. 18.6 (a) or when the reversible motion
is desired, then a quarter turn belt drive with a guide pulley, as shown in Fig. 18.6 (b), may be used.

4. Belt drive with idler pulleys. A belt drive with an idler pulley (also known as jockey pulley
drive) as shown in Fig. 18.7, is used with shafts arranged parallel and when an open belt drive can not
be used due to small angle of contact on the smaller pulley. This type of drive is provided to obtain
high velocity ratio and when the required belt tension can not be obtained by other means.

When it is desired to transmit motion from one shaft to several shafts, all arranged in parallel, a
belt drive with many idler pulleys, as shown in Fig. 18.8, may be employed.
5. Compound belt drive. A compound belt drive as shown in Fig. 18.9, is used when power is
transmitted from one shaft to another through a number of pulleys.

6. Stepped or cone pulley drive. A stepped or cone pulley drive, as shown in Fig. 18.10, is used
for changing the speed of the driven shaft while the main or driving shaft runs at constant speed. This
is accomplished by shifting the belt from one part of the steps to the other.

7. Fast and loose pulley drive. A fast and loose pulley drive, as shown in Fig. 18.11, is used
when the driven or machine shaft is to be started or stopped whenever desired without interferring
with the driving shaft. A pulley which is keyed to the machine shaft is called fast pulley and runs at the
same speed as that of machine shaft. A loose pulley runs freely over the machine shaft and is
incapable of transmitting any power. When the driven shaft is required to be stopped, the belt is
pushed on to the loose pulley by means of sliding bar having belt forks.

18.13 Velocity Ratio of a Belt Drive
It is the ratio between the velocities of the driver and the follower or driven. It may be
expressed, mathematically, as discussed below:
Let
d1 = Diameter of the driver,
d2 = Diameter of the follower,
N1 = Speed of the driver in r.p.m.,
N2 = Speed of the follower in r.p.m.,
∴  Length of the belt that passes over the driver, in one minute
= π d1 N1
Similarly, length of the belt that passes over the follower, in one minute
= π d2 N2
Since the length of belt that passes over the driver in one minute is equal to the length of belt that
passes over the follower in one minute, therefore
Q
π d1 N1 = π d2 N2
and velocity ratio,

18.14 Slip of the Belt
In the previous articles we have discussed the motion of belts and pulleys assuming a firm
frictional grip between the belts and the pulleys. But sometimes, the frictional grip becomes insufficient.
This may cause some forward motion of the driver without carrying the belt with it. This is called slip
of the belt and is generally expressed as a percentage.
The result of the belt slipping is to reduce the velocity ratio of the system. As the slipping of the
belt is a common phenomenon, thus the belt should never be used where a definite velocity ratio is of
importance (as in the case of hour, minute and second arms in a watch).
Let
s1 % = Slip between the driver and the belt, and
s2 % = Slip between the belt and follower,

18.15   Creep of Belt
When the belt passes from the slack side to the tight side, a certain portion of the belt extends
and it contracts again when the belt passes from the tight side to the slack side. Due to these changes
of length, there is a relative motion between the belt and the pulley surfaces. This relative motion is
termed as creep. The total effect of creep is to reduce slightly the speed of the driven pulley or
follower. Considering creep, the velocity ratio is given by

Example 18.1. An engine running at 150 r.p.m. drives a line shaft by means of a belt. The
engine pulley is 750 mm diameter and the pulley on the line shaft is 450 mm. A 900 mm diameter

Let the belt leaves the larger pulley at E and G and the smaller pulley at F and H as shown in

From the geometry of the figure, we find that O2M will be perpendicular to O1E.
Let the angle MO2O1 = α radians.

18.17 Length of a Cross Belt Drive
We have discussed in Art. 18.12 that in a cross belt drive, both the pulleys rotate in the opposite
directions as shown in Fig. 18.14.
Let
r1 and r2 = Radii of the larger and smaller pulleys,
x = Distance between the centres of two pulleys (i.e. O1O2 ), and
L = Total length of the belt.
Let the belt leaves the larger pulley at E and G and the smaller pulley at F and H as shown in
Fig. 18.14.
Through O2 draw O2M parallel to FE.
From the geometry of the figure, we find that O2M will be perpendicular to O1E.
Let the angle MO2O1 = α radians.
We know that the length of the belt,
L = Arc GJE + EF + Arc FKH + HG
= 2 (Arc JE + FE + Arc FK)

It may be noted that the above expression is a function of (r1 + r2). It is thus obvious, that if sum
of the radii of the two pulleys be constant, length of the belt required will also remain constant,
provided the distance between centres of the pulleys remain unchanged.
18.18 Power Transmitted by a Belt
Fig. 18.15 shows the driving pulley (or driver) A and the driven pulley (or follower) B. As
already discussed, the driving pulley pulls the belt from one side and delivers it to the other side. It is
thus obvious that the tension on the former side (i.e. tight side) will be greater than the latter side (i.e.
slack side) as shown in Fig. 18.15.
Fig. 18.15. Power transmitted by a belt.
Let
T1 and T2 = Tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt respectively in
newtons,
r1 and r2 = Radii of the driving and driven pulleys respectively in metres,
and
ν = Velocity of the belt in m/s.
The effective turning (driving) force at the circumference of the driven pulley or follower is the
difference between the two tensions (i.e. T1 – T2).
This massive shaft-like pulley drives the conveyor belt.
Contents
Top
Flat Belt Drives     693
∴ Work done per second = (T1 – T2) ν N-m/s
and
power transmitted = (T1 – T2) ν W
... (Q 1 N-m/s = 1W)
A little consideration will show that torque exerted on the driving pulley is (T1 – T2) r1.
Similarly, the torque exerted on the driven pulley is (T1 – T2) r2.
18.19 Ratio of Driving Tensions for Flat Belt Drive
Consider a driven pulley rotating in the clockwise direction as shown in Fig. 18.16.
Let
T1 = Tension in the belt on the tight side,
T2 = Tension in the belt on the slack side, and
θ = Angle of contact in radians (i.e. angle subtended by the arc AB,
along which the belt touches the pulley, at the centre).
Now consider a small portion of the belt PQ, subtending an angle δθ at the centre of the pulley
as shown in Fig. 18.16. The belt PQ is in equilibrium under the following forces:
1. Tension T in the belt at P,
2. Tension (T + δT) in the belt at Q,
3. Normal reaction RN, and
4. Frictional force F = μ × RN,
where μ is the coefficient of friction between the belt
and pulley.

2. When the pulleys are made of different material (i.e. when the coefficient of friction of the pulleys or
the angle of contact are different), then the design will refer to the pulley for which μ.θ is small.
Example 18.2. Two pulleys, one 450 mm diameter and the other 200 mm diameter, on parallel
shafts 1.95 m apart are connected by a crossed belt. Find the length of the belt required and the angle
of contact between the belt and each pulley.
What power can be transmitted by the belt when the larger pulley rotates at 200 rev/min, if the
maximum permissible tension in the belt is 1 kN, and the coefficient of friction between the belt and
pulley is 0.25?
Solution. Given : d1 = 450 mm = 0.45 m or r1 = 0.225 m ; d2 = 200 mm = 0.2 m or
r2 = 0.1 m ; x = 1.95 m ; N1 = 200 r.p.m. ; T1 = 1 kN = 1000 N ; μ = 0.25

18.20 Centrifugal Tension
Since the belt continuously runs over the pulleys,
therefore, some centrifugal force is caused, whose effect
is to increase the tension on both the tight as well as the
slack sides. The tension caused by centrifugal force is called
centrifugal tension. At lower belt speeds (less than
10 m/s), the centrifugal tension is very small, but at higher
belt speeds (more than 10 m/s), its effect is considerable
and thus should be taken into account.
Consider a small portion PQ of the belt subtending
an angle dθ at the centre of the pulley, as shown in
Fig. 18.18.
Contents

696    A Textbook of Machine Design
Let
m = Mass of belt per unit length in kg,
v = Linear velocity of belt in m/s,
r = Radius of pulley over which the belt runs in metres, and
TC = Centrifugal tension acting tangentially at P and Q in newtons.
We know that length of the belt PQ
= r.dθ
and
mass of the belt PQ
= m.r.dθ
∴ Centrifugal force acting on the belt PQ,
FC = m.r.dθ × 
2

r  = m.dθ.v2

and total tension in the slack side,

2. Power transmitted,

Thus we see that the centrifugal tension has no effect on the power transmitted.

18.21 Maximum Tension in the Belt
A little consideration will show that the maximum tension in the belt (T ) is equal to the total
tension in the tight side of the belt (Tt1).
Let
σ = Maximum safe stress,
b = Width of the belt, and
t = Thickness of the belt.
We know that the maximum tension in the belt,
T = Maximum stress × Cross-sectional area of belt = σ.b.t
When centrifugal tension is neglected, then
T (or Tt1) = T1, i.e. Tension in the tight side of the belt.
When centrifugal tension is considered, then
T (or Tt1) = T1 + TC
18.22 Condition for the Transmission of Maximum Power
We know that the power transmitted by a belt,
P = (T1 – T2) v

where
T1 = Tension in the tight side in newtons,

diameter at 336 r.p.m. If the active arc on the smaller pulley is 120° and the stress in tight side is
2 MPa, find the power capacity of the belt. The density of leather may be taken as 980 kg/m3, and the
coefficient of friction of leather on cast iron is 0.35.
Solution. Given: t = 9 mm = 0.009 m ; b = 250 mm = 0.25 m; d = 900 mm = 0.9 m ;
N = 336 r.p.m ; θ = 120° = 120 × 180

We know that the power capacity of the belt,

Notes :The power capacity of the belt, when centrifugal tension is taken into account, may also be obtained as
discussed below :
1. We know that the maximum tension in the tight side of the belt,
Tt1 = T = 4500 N
Centrifugal tension,
TC = 550 N
and tension in the slack side of the belt,
T2 = 1895 N
∴ Total tension in the slack side of the belt,
Tt2 = T2 + TC = 1895 + 550 = 2445 N
We know that the power capacity of the belt,

b = Width of the belt required in metres.
We know that mass of the belt per metre length,

θ2 = 3.78 rad ; μ1 = 0.3; μ2 = 0.25 ; N1 = 700 r.p.m. ; P = 22.5 kW = 22.5 × 103 W ; t = 5 mm

We have discussed in Art. 18.19 (Note 2) that when the pulleys are made of different material
[i.e. when the pulleys have different coefficient of friction (μ) or different angle of contact (θ), then
the design will refer to a pulley for which μ.θ is small.
∴  For motor pulley,        μ1.θ1  = 0.3 × 2.5 = 0.75

From equations (i) and (ii), we find that

Let
b = Width of the belt in metres.
Since the velocity of the belt is more than 10 m/s, therefore centrifugal tension must be taken
into consideration. Assuming a leather belt for which the density may be taken as 1000 kg / m3.
∴  Mass of the belt per metre length,
m = Area × length × density = b × t × l × ρ
= b × 0.005 × 1 × 1000 = 5 b kg/m
and centrifugal tension,
TC = m.v2 = 5 b (14.7)2 = 1080 b N
We know that the maximum (or total) tension in the belt,
T = T1 + TC = Stress × Area = σ.b.t
or
2896 + 1080 b = 2.3 × 106 b × 0.005 = 11 500 b
∴
11 500 b – 1080 b = 2896   or   b = 0.278 say 0.28 m or 280 mm Ans.
Example 18.6. Design a rubber belt to drive a dynamo generating 20 kW at 2250 r.p.m. and

Solution. Given : P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W ; N = 2250 r.p.m. ; d = 200 mm = 0.2 m ;
ηd = 85% = 0.85 ; σ = 2.1 MPa = 2.1 × 106 N/m2 ; ρ = 1000 kg/m3 ; θ = 165° = 165 × π/180

From equations (i) and (ii), we find that
T1 = 1719 N ; and T2 = 724 N
Let
b = Width of the belt in metres, and
t = Thickness of the belt in metres.
Assuming thickness of the belt, t = 10 mm = 0.01 m, we have
Cross-sectional area of the belt
= b × t = b × 0.01 = 0.01 b m2
We know that mass of the belt per metre length,
m = Area × length × density = 0.01 b × 1 × 1000 = 10 b kg / m
∴ Centrifugal tension,
TC = m.v2 = 10 b (23.6)2 = 5570 b N
We know that maximum tension in the belt,
T = σ.b.t = 2.1 × 106 × b × 0.01 = 21 000 b N
and tension in the tight side of belt (T1),
1719 = T – TC = 21 000 b – 5570 b = 15 430 b
∴
b = 1719 / 15 430 = 0.1114 m = 111.4 mm
The standard width of the belt (b) is 112 mm. Ans.
Example 18.7. Design a belt drive to transmit 110 kW for a system consisting of two pulleys of

a slip of 1.2% at each pulley and 5% friction loss at each shaft, 20% over load.
Solution. Given : P = 110 kW = 110 × 103 W ; d1 = 0.9 m or r1 = 0.45 m ; d2 = 1.2 m
or r2 = 0.6 m ; x = 3.6 m ; v = 20 m/s ; μ = 0.3 ; s1 = s2 = 1.2%

Since there is a 5% friction loss at each shaft, therefore torque acting on the belt

Since the belt is to be designed for 20% overload, therefore design torque
= 1.2 × 3500 = 4200 N-m
Let
T1 = Tension in the tight side of the belt, and
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the belt.
We know that the torque exerted on the driven pulley
= (T1 – T2) r2 = (T1 – T2) 0.6 = 0.6 (T1 – T2) N-m
Equating this to the design torque, we have
0.6 (T1 – T2) = 4200   or   T1 – T2 = 4200 / 0.6 = 7000 N

...(Assume)

b = Width of the belt in metres.
Since the belt speed is more than 10 m/s, therefore centrifugal tension must be taken into

∴ Mass of the belt per metre length,
m = Area × length × density = b × t × l × ρ

Example 18.8. A belt 100 mm wide and 10 mm thick is transmitting power at 1000 metres/min.
The net driving tension is 1.8 times the tension on the slack side. If the safe permissible stress on the
belt section in 1.6 MPa, calculate the maximum power, that can be transmitted at this speed. Assume
density of the leather as 1000 kg/m3.
Calculate the absolute maximum power that can be transmitted by this belt and the speed at
which this can be transmitted.
Solution. Given : b = 100 mm = 0.1 m ; t = 10 mm = 0.01 m ; v = 1000 m/min = 16.67 m/s ;
T1 – T2 = 1.8 T2 ; σ = 1.6 MPa = 1.6 N/mm2 ; ρ = 1000 kg/m3

Let
T1 = Tension in the tight side of the belt, and

We know that the maximum tension in the belt,

18.23 Initial Tension in the Belt
When a belt is wound round the two pulleys (i.e. driver and follower), its two ends are joined
together, so that the belt may continuously move over the pulleys, since the motion of the belt (from
the driver) and the follower (from the belt) is governed by a firm grip due to friction between the belt
and the pulleys. In order to increase this grip, the belt is tightened up. At this stage, even when the
pulleys are stationary, the belt is subjected to some tension, called initial tension.
When the driver starts rotating, it pulls the belt from one side (increasing tension in the belt on
this side) and delivers to the other side (decreasing tension in the belt on that side). The increased
tension in one side of the belt is called tension in tight side and the decreased tension in the other side
of the belt is called tension in the slack side.
Let
T0 = Initial tension in the belt,
T1 = Tension in the tight side of the belt,
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the belt, and
α = Coefficient of increase of the belt length per unit force.
A little consideration will show that the increase of tension in the tight side
= T1 – T0
and increase in the length of the belt on the tight side
= α (T1 – T0)
...(i)
Similarly, decrease in tension in the slack side
= T0 – T2
and decrease in the length of the belt on the slack side
= α (T0 – T2)
...(ii)
Assuming that the belt material is perfectly elastic such that the length of the belt remains
constant, when it is at rest or in motion, therefore increase in length on the tight side is equal to
decrease in the length on the slack side. Thus, equating equations (i) and (ii), we have
α (T1 – T0) = α (T0 – T2)

Example 18.9. Two parallel shafts whose centre lines are 4.8 m apart, are connected by an
open belt drive. The diameter of the larger pulley is 1.5 m and that of smaller pulley 1 m. The initial
tension in the belt when stationary is 3 kN. The mass of the belt is 1.5 kg / m length. The coefficient
of friction between the belt and the pulley is 0.3. Taking centrifugal tension into account, calculate
the power transmitted, when the smaller pulley rotates at 400 r.p.m.
Solution. Given : x = 4.8 m ; d1 = 1.5 m ; d2 = 1 m ; T0 = 3 kN = 3000 N ; m = 1.5 kg/m ; μ =

Example 18.10. In a horizontal belt drive for a centrifugal blower, the blower is belt driven at
600 r.p.m. by a 15 kW, 1750 r.p.m. electric motor. The centre distance is twice the diameter of the
larger pulley. The density of the belt material = 1500 kg/m3; maximum allowable stress = 4 MPa;
μ1 = 0.5 (motor pulley); μ2 = 0.4 (blower pulley); peripheral velocity of the belt = 20 m/s. Determine
the following:
1. Pulley diameters; 2. belt length; 3. cross-sectional area of the belt; 4. minimum initial
tension for operation without slip; and 5. resultant force in the plane of the blower when operating
with an initial tension 50 per cent greater than the minimum value.
Solution. Given : N2 = 600 r.p.m. ; P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W ; N1 = 1750 r.p.m . ;

We know that angle of contact on the motor pulley,
θ1 = 180° – 2α = 180 – 2 × 9.46 = 161.08°
= 161.08 × π / 180 = 2.8 rad
and angle of contact on the blower pulley,
θ2 = 180° + 2α = 180 + 2 × 9.46 = 198.92°
= 198.92 × π / 180 = 3.47 rad
Since both the pulleys have different coefficient of friction (μ), therefore the design will refer to
a pulley for which μ.θ is small.
∴ For motor pulley,
μ1.θ1 = 0.5 × 2.8 = 1.4
and for blower pulley,
μ2.θ2 = 0.4 × 3.47 = 1.388
Since μ2.θ2 for the blower pulley is less then μ1.θ1, therefore the design is based on the blower
pulley.
Let
T1 = Tension in the tight side of the belt, and
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the belt.
We know that power transmitted (P),
15 × 103 = (T1 – T2) v = (T1 – T2) 20

and
T1' = 4 T2' = 4 × 410.24 = 1640.96 N
∴ Resultant force in the plane of the blower

Example 18.11. An open belt connects two flat pulleys. The pulley diameters are 300 mm and
450 mm and the corresponding angles of lap are 160° and 210°. The smaller pulley runs at 200
r.p.m. The coefficient of friction between the belt and pulley is 0.25. It is found that the belt is on the
point of slipping when 3 kW is transmitted. To increase the power transmitted two alternatives are
suggested, namely (i) increasing the initial tension by 10%, and (ii) increasing the coefficient of
friction by 10% by the application of a suitable dressing to the belt.
Which of these two methods would be more effective? Find the percentage increase in power
possible in each case.
Solution. Given : d1 = 300 mm = 0.3 m ; d2 = 450 mm = 0.45 m ; θ1 = 160° = 160 × 180
π  = 2.8
rad ; θ2 = 210° = 210 × 180
π  = 3.66 rad ; N1 = 200 r.p.m.; μ = 0.25 ; P = 3 kW = 3000 W
Let
T1 = Tension in the tight side of the belt, and
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the belt.
We have discussed in Art 18.19 (Note 2) that when the pulleys are made of different material
[i.e. when the pulleys have different coefficient of friction (μ) or different angle of contact (θ)], then
the design will be refer to a pulley for which μ.θ is small.

∴ For smaller pulley, μ.θ1 = 0.25 × 2.8 = 0.7
and for larger pulley, 
  μ.θ2 = 0.25 × 3.66 = 0.915
Since μ.θ1 for the smaller pulley is less than μ.θ2, therefore the design is based on the smaller
pulley.

equation (iii),
2.015 T2 + T2 = 3120.7   or   T2 = 3120.7 / 3.015 = 1035 N

T1 = 2.015 T2 = 2.015 × 1035 = 2085.7 N

19.1 Introduction
The pulleys are used to transmit power from one shaft
to another by means of flat belts, V-belts or ropes. Since
the velocity ratio is the inverse ratio of the diameters of
driving and driven pulleys, therefore the pulley diameters
should be carefully selected in order to have a desired
velocity ratio. The pulleys must be in perfect alignment in
order to allow the belt to travel in a line normal to the pulley
faces.
The pulleys may be made of cast iron, cast steel or
pressed steel, wood and paper. The cast materials should
have good friction and wear characteristics. The pulleys
made of pressed steel are lighter than cast pulleys, but in
many cases they have lower friction and may produce
excessive wear.

19.2 Types of Pulleys for Flat Belts
Following are the various types of pulleys for flat belts :
1. Cast iron pulleys, 2. Steel pulleys, 3. Wooden pulleys, 4. Paper pulleys, and 5. Fast and loose
pulleys.
We shall now discuss, the above mentioned pulleys in the following pages.
19.3 Cast Iron Pulleys
The pulleys are generally made of *cast iron, because of their low cost. The rim is held in place
by web from the central boss or by arms or spokes. The arms may be straight or curved as shown in
Fig. 19.1 (a) and (b) and the cross-section is usually elliptical.
Fig. 19.1. Solid cast iron pulleys.
When a cast pulley contracts in the mould,
the arms are in a state of stress and very liable to
break. The curved arms tend to yield rather than to
break. The arms are near the hub.
The cast iron pulleys are generally made with
rounded rims. This slight convexity is known as
crowning. The crowning tends to keep the belt in
centre on a pulley rim while in motion. The
crowning may be 9 mm for 300 mm width of pulley
face.
The cast iron pulleys may be solid as shown
in Fig. 19.1 or split type as shown in Fig. 19.2.
When it is necessary to mount a pulley on a shaft
which already carrying pulleys etc. or have its
ends swelled, it is easier to use a split-pulley.
There is a clearance between the faces and the
two halves are readily tightened upon the shafts
by the bolts as shown in Fig. 19.2. A sunk key is
used for heavy drives.
*
For further details, please refer IS : 1691 – 1980 (Reaffirmed 1990).

19.4 Steel Pulleys
Steel pulleys are made
from pressed steel sheets and
have great strength and
durability. These pulleys are
lighter in weight (about 40 to
60% less) than cast iron pulleys
of the same capacity and are
designed to run at high speeds.
They present a coefficient of
friction with leather belting
which is atleast equal to that
obtained by cast iron pulleys.
Steel pulleys are generally
made in two halves which are
bolted together. The clamping
action of the hub holds the pulley
to its shaft, thus no key is required except for most severe service. Steel pulleys are generally equipped
with interchangeable bushings to permit their use with shafts of different sizes. The following table
shows the number of spokes and their sizes according to Indian Standards, IS : 1691 – 1980 (Reaffirmed
1990).

IS : 1691 – 1980 (Reaffirmed 1990).

Other proportions for the steel pulleys are :
Length of hub = Width of face
2
The length of hub should not be less than 100 mm for 19 mm diameter spokes and 138 mm for
22 mm diameter of spokes.
Thickness of rim = 5 mm for all sizes.
A single row of spokes is used for pulleys having width upto 300 mm and double row of spokes
for widths above 300 mm.
19.5 Wooden Pulleys
Wooden pulleys are lighter and possesses higher coefficient of friction than cast iron or steel
pulleys. These pulleys have 2/3rd of the weight of cast iron pulleys of similar size. They are generally
made from selected maple which is laid in segments and glued together under heavy pressure. They
are kept from absorbing moisture by protective coatings of shellac or varnish so that warping may not

occur. These pulleys are made both solid or split with cast iron hubs with keyways or have adjustable
bushings which prevents relative rotation between them and the shaft by the frictional resistance set
up. These pulleys are used for motor drives in which the contact arc between the pulley face and belt
is restricted.
19.6 Paper Pulleys
Paper pulleys are made from compressed paper fibre and are formed with a metal in the centre.
These pulleys are usually used for belt transmission from electric motors, when the centre to centre
shaft distance is small.
19.7 Fast and Loose Pulleys
A fast and loose pulley, as shown in Fig. 19.3, used on shafts enables machine to be started or
stopped at will. A fast pulley is keyed to the machine shaft while the loose pulley runs freely. The belt
runs over the fast pulley to transmit power by the machine and it is shifted to the loose pulley when the
machine is not required to transmit power. By this way, stopping of one machine does not interfere
with the other machines which run by the same line shaft.

Flat Belt Pulleys     719
The loose pulley is provided with a cast iron or gun-metal bush with a collar at one end to
prevent axial movement.
The rim of the fast pulley is made larger than the loose pulley so that the belt may run slackly on
the loose pulley. The loose pulley usually have longer hub in order to reduce wear and friction and it
requires proper lubrication.
19.8 Design of Cast Iron Pulleys
The following procedure may be adopted for the design of cast iron pulleys.
1. Dimensions of pulley
(i) The diameter of the pulley (D) may be obtained either from velocity ratio consideration or
centrifugal stress consideration. We know that the centrifugal stress induced in the rim of the pulley,
σt = ρ.ν2
where
ρ = Density of the rim material
= 7200 kg/m3 for cast iron
ν = Velocity of the rim = πDN / 60, D being the diameter of pulley and
N is speed of the pulley.
The following are the diameter of pulleys in mm for flat and V-belts.
20, 22, 25, 28, 32, 36, 40, 45, 50, 56, 63, 71, 80, 90, 100, 112, 125, 140, 160, 180, 200, 224,
250, 280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710, 800, 900, 1000, 1120, 1250, 1400, 1600, 1800,
2000, 2240, 2500, 2800, 3150, 3550, 4000, 5000, 5400.
The first six sizes (20 to 36 mm) are used for V-belts only.
(ii) If the width of the belt is known, then width of the pulley or face of the pulley (B) is taken
25% greater than the width of belt.
∴
B = 1.25 b ; where b = Width of belt.
According to Indian Standards, IS : 2122 (Part I) – 1973 (Reaffirmed 1990), the width of pulley
is fixed as given in the following table :
Table 19.2. Standard width of pulley.

The following are the width of flat cast iron and mild steel pulleys in mm :
16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 63, 71, 80, 90, 100, 112, 125, 140, 160, 180, 200, 224, 250, 315, 355,
400, 450, 560, 630.
(iii) The thickness of the pulley rim (t) varies from 300
D + 2 mm to 200
D + 3 mm for single belt
and 200
D  + 6 mm for double belt. The diameter of the pulley (D) is in mm.
2. Dimensions of arms
(i) The number of arms may be taken as 4 for pulley diameter from 200 mm to 600 mm and 6 for
diameter from 600 mm to 1500 mm.
Note : The pulleys less than 200 mm diameter are made with solid disc instead of arms. The thickness of the
solid web is taken equal to the thickness of rim measured at the centre of the pulley face.

720    A Textbook of Machine Design
(ii) The cross-section of the arms is usually elliptical with major axis (a1) equal to twice the
minor axis (b1). The cross-section of the arm is obtained by considering the arm as cantilever i.e.
fixed at the hub end and carrying a concentrated load at the rim end. The length of the cantilever is
taken equal to the radius of the pulley. It is further assumed that at any given time, the power is
transmitted from the hub to the rim or vice versa, through only half the total number of arms.

Now using the relation,
σb or σt = M / Z, the cross-section of the arms is
obtained.
(iii) The arms are tapered from hub to rim. The taper is usually
1/48 to 1/32.
(iv) When the width of the pulley exceeds the diameter of the pulley, then two rows of arms are
provided, as shown in Fig. 19.4. This is done to avoid heavy arms in one row.
3.  Dimensions of hub
(i) The diameter of the hub ( d1 ) in terms of shaft diameter ( d ) may be fixed by the following
relation :
d1 = 1.5 d + 25 mm
The diameter of the hub should not be greater than 2 d.
(ii) The length of the hub,
L = 2

π ×
The minimum length of the hub is 2
3   B but it should not be more than width of the pulley (B).
Example 19.1. A cast iron pulley transmits 20 kW at 300 r.p.m. The diameter of pulley is 550
mm and has four straight arms of elliptical cross-section in which the major axis is twice the minor
axis. Find the dimensions of the arm if the allowable bending stress is 15 MPa. Mention the plane in
which the major axis of the arm should lie.
Solution. Given : P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W ; N = 300 r.p.m. ; *d = 550 mm ; n = 4 ;
σb = 15 MPa = 15 N/mm2

The major axis will be in the plane of rotation which is also the plane of bending.
Example 19.2. An overhung pulley transmits 35 kW at 240 r.p.m. The belt drive is vertical and
the angle of wrap may be taken as 180°. The distance of the pulley centre line from the nearest
bearing is 350 mm. μ = 0.25. Determine :
1. Diameter of the pulley ;
2. Width of the belt assuming thickness of 10 mm ;
3. Diameter of the shaft ;
4. Dimensions of the key for securing the pulley
on to the shaft ; and
5. Size of the arms six in number.
The section of the arm may be taken as elliptical,
the major axis being twice the minor axis.
The following stresses may be taken for design
purposes :
Shaft
Tension and compression — 80 MPa
Key
Shear
— 50 MPa
Belt : Tension
—  2.5 MPa
Pulley rim : Tension
— 4.5 MPa
Pulley arms : Tension

Solution. Given : P = 35 kW = 35 × 103 W ; N = 240 r.p.m. ; θ = 180º = π rad ; L = 350 mm
= 0.35 m ; μ = 0.25 ; t = 10 mm ; n = 6 ; σts = σtk = 80 MPa = 80 N/mm2 ; τs = τk = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2 ;
σ = 2.5 MPa = 2.5 N/mm2 ; σt = 4.5 MPa = 4.5 N/mm2 ; σb = 15 MPa = 15 N/mm2
1. Diameter of the pulley
Let
D = Diameter of the pulley,
σt = Centrifugal stress or tensile stress in the pulley rim

We know that centrifugal stress (σt),

T1 = Tension in the tight side of the belt, and
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the belt.
We know that the power transmitted (P),
35 × 103 = (T1 – T2) ν = (T1 – T2) 25
∴
T1 – T2 = 35 × 103 / 25 =1400 N

... (Taking antilog of 0.3415)
From equations (i) and (ii), we find that
T1 = 2572 N ; and T2 = 1172 N
Since the velocity of the belt (or pulley) is more than 10 m/s, therefore centrifugal tension
must be taken into consideration. Assuming a leather belt for which the density may be taken as
1000 kg/m3.
We know that cross-sectional area of the belt,

We know that centrifugal tension,
TC = m.v2 = 0.01 b (25)2 = 6.25 b N
and maximum tension in the belt,
T = σ.b.t = 2.5 × b × 10 = 25 b N
We know that tension in the tight side of the belt (T1),
2572 = T – TC = 25 b – 6.25 b = 18.75 b
∴
b = 2572 / 18.75 = 137 mm
The standard width of the belt (b) is 140 mm. Ans.

7500
= (T1 – T2 ) ν
= (T1 – T2 ) 9.426
T1 – T2

therefore the centrifugal tension need not to be

20.1 Introduction
We have already discussed that a V-belt is mostly used
in factories and workshops where a great amount of power
is to be transmitted from one pulley to another when the
two pulleys are very near to each other.
The V-belts are made of fabric and cords moulded in
rubber and covered with fabric and rubber as shown in Fig.
20.1 (a). These belts are moulded to a trapezoidal shape
and are made endless. These are particularly suitable for
short drives. The included angle for the V-belt is usually
from 30° to 40°. The power is transmitted by the *wedging
* The wedging action of the V-belt in the groove of the pulley
results in higher forces of friction. A little consideration will show
that the wedging action and the transmitted torque will be more if
the groove angle of the pulley is small. But a small groove angle
will require more force to pull the belt out of the groove which will
result in loss of power and  excessive belt wear due to friction and
heat. Hence the selected groove angle is a compromise between the
two. Usually the groove angles of 32° to 38° are used.

action between the belt and the V-groove in the pulley or sheave. A clearance must be provided at the
bottom of the groove as shown in Fig. 20.1 (b), in order to prevent touching of the bottom as it
becomes narrower from wear. The V-belt drive may be inclined at any angle with tight side either at
top or bottom. In order to increase the power output, several V-belts may be operated side by side. It
may be noted that in multiple V-belt drive, all the belts should stretch at the same rate so that the load
is equally divided between them. When one of the set of belts break, the entire set should be replaced
at the same time. If only one belt is replaced, the new unworn and unstretched belt will be more tightly
stretched and will move with different velocity.

20.2 Types of V-belts and Pulleys
According to Indian Standards (IS: 2494 – 1974), the V-belts are made in five types i.e.  A, B, C,
D and E. The dimensions for standard V-belts are shown in Table 20.1. The pulleys for V-belts may
be made of cast iron or pressed steel in order to reduce weight. The dimensions for the standard
V-grooved pulley according to IS: 2494 – 1974, are shown in Table 20.2.

20.3 Standard Pitch Lengths of V-belts
According to IS: 2494-1974, the V-belts are designated by its type and nominal inside length.
For example, a V-belt of type A and inside length 914 mm is designated as A 914–IS: 2494. The
standard inside lengths of V-belts in mm
are as follows :
610, 660, 711, 787, 813, 889, 914,
965, 991, 1016, 1067, 1092, 1168, 1219,
1295, 1372, 1397, 1422, 1473, 1524, 1600,
1626, 1651, 1727, 1778, 1905, 1981, 2032,

13 665, 15 189, 16 713
According to IS: 2494-1974, the
pitch length is defined as the
circumferential length of the belt at the
pitch width (i.e. the width at the neutral
axis) of the belt. The value of the pitch
width remains constant for each type of belt
irrespective of the groove angle.
The pitch lengths are obtained by
adding to inside length: 36 mm for type A, 43 mm for type B, 56 mm for type C, 79 mm for type D and
92 mm for type E. The following table shows the standard pitch lengths for the various types of belt.

Note: The V-belts are also manufactured in non-standard pitch lengths (i.e. in oversize and undersize). The
standard pitch length belt is designated by grade number 50. The oversize belts are designated by a grade

number more than 50, while the undersize belts are designated by a grade number less than 50. It may be noted
that one unit of a grade number represents 2.5 mm in length from nominal pitch length. For example, a V-belt
marked A – 914 – 50 denotes a standard belt of inside length 914 mm and a pitch length 950 mm. A belt marked
A – 914 – 52 denotes an oversize belt by an amount of (52 – 50) = 2 units of grade number. Since one unit of
grade number represents 2.5 mm, therefore the pitch length of this belt will be 950 + 2 × 2.5 = 955 mm.
Similarly, a belt marked A – 914 – 48 denotes an undersize belt, whose pitch length will be 950 – 2 × 2.5 = 945 mm.
20.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of V-belt Drive over Flat Belt Drive
Following are the advantages and disadvantages of the V-belt drive over flat belt drive :
Advantages
1.
The V-belt drive gives compactness due to the small distance between centres of pulleys.
2.
The drive is positive, because the slip between the belt and the pulley groove is negligible.
3.
Since the V-belts are made endless and there is no joint trouble, therefore the drive is smooth.
4.
It provides longer life, 3 to 5 years.
5.
It can be easily installed and removed.
6.
The operation of the belt and pulley is quiet.
7.
The belts have the ability to cushion the shock when machines are started.
8.
The high velocity ratio (maximum 10) may be obtained.
9.
The wedging action of the belt in the groove gives high value of limiting *ratio of tensions.
Therefore the power transmitted by V-belts is more than flat belts for the same coefficient of
friction, arc of contact and allowable tension in the belts.
10.
The V-belt may be operated in either direction, with tight side of the belt at the top or
bottom. The centre line may be horizontal, vertical or inclined.
Disadvantages
1.
The V-belt drive can not be used with large centre distances, because of larger weight per
unit length.
2.
The V-belts are not so durable as flat belts.
3.
The construction of pulleys for V-belts is more complicated than pulleys of flat belts.
4.
Since the V-belts are subjected to certain amount of creep, therefore these are not suitable
for constant speed applications such as synchronous machines and timing devices.
5.
The belt life is greatly influenced with temperature changes, improper belt tension and
mismatching of belt lengths.
6.
The centrifugal tension prevents the use of V-belts at speeds below 5 m / s and above 50 m / s.
20.5 Ratio of Driving Tensions for V-belt
A V-belt with a grooved pulley is shown in Fig. 20.2.
Let
R1 = Normal reactions between belts and
sides of the groove.
R = Total reaction in the plane of the
groove.
μ = Coefficient of friction between the
belt and sides of the groove.
Resolving the reactions vertically to the groove, we have
R = R1 sin β + R1 sin β = 2R1 sin β

Consider a small portion of the belt, as in Art. 18.19, subtending an angle δθ at the centre, the
tension on one side will be T and on the other side (T + δT). Now proceeding in the same way as in
Art. 18.19, we get the frictional resistance equal to μ R. cosec β against μ.R. Thus the relation between
T1 and T2 for the V-belt drive will be
2.3 log (T1 / T2) = μ.θ cosec β
20.6 V-flat Drives
In many cases, particularly, when a flat belt is
replaced by V-belt, it is economical to use flat-faced
pulley, instead of large grooved pulley, as shown in
Fig. 20.3. The cost of cutting the grooves is thereby
eliminated. Such a drive is known as V-flat drive.
Example 20.1. A compressor, requiring 90 kW, is to run at about 250 r.p.m. The drive is by
V-belts from an electric motor running at 750 r.p.m. The diameter of the pulley on the compressor
shaft must not be greater than 1 metre while the centre distance between the pulleys is limited to 1.75
metre. The belt speed should not exceed 1600 m / min.
Determine the number of V-belts required to transmit the power if each belt has a cross-
sectional area of 375 mm2, density 1000 kg / m3 and an allowable tensile stress of 2.5 MPa. The
groove angle of the pulleys is 35°. The coefficient of friction between the belt and the pulley is 0.25.
Calculate also the length required of each belt.
Solution. Given : P = 90 kW = 90 × 103 W ; N2 = 250 r.p.m. ; N1 = 750 r.p.m. ; d2 = 1 m ;
x = 1.75 m ; v = 1600 m/min = 26.67 m/s ; a = 375 mm2 = 375 × 10– 6 m2 ; ρ = 1000 kg / m3 ; σ = 2.5
MPa = 2.5 N/mm2 ; 2β = 35° or β = 17.5° ; μ = 0.25
First of all, let us find the diameter of pulley on the motor shaft (d1). We know that

We know that mass of the belt per metre length,
m = Area × length × density = 375 × 10–6 × 1 × 1000 = 0.375 kg / m
∴    Centrifugal tension,
TC = m.v2 = 0.375 (26.67)2 = 267 N
and maximum tension in the belt,
T = σ × a = 2.5 × 375 = 937.5 N
∴    Tension in the tight side of the belt,
T1 = T – TC = 937.5 – 267 = 670.5 N
Let
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the belt.

Example 20.2. A belt drive consists of two V-belts in parallel, on grooved pulleys of the same
size. The angle of the groove is 30°. The cross-sectional area of each belt is 750 mm2 and μ = 0.12.
The density of the belt material is 1.2 Mg / m3 and the maximum safe stress in the material is 7 MPa.
Calculate the power that can be transmitted between pulleys of 300 mm diameter rotating at 1500
r.p.m. Find also the shaft speed in r.p.m. at which the power transmitted would be a maximum.
Solution. Given : n = 2 ; 2 β = 30° or β = 15° ; a = 750 mm2 = 750 × 10–6 m2 ; μ = 0.12 ; ρ = 1.2
Mg/m3 = 1200 kg/m3 ; σ = 7 MPa = 7 × 106 N/m2 ; d = 300 mm = 0.3 m ; N = 1500 r.p.m.
We know that mass of the belt per metre length,

driving pulley is supplied with 95 kW power and has an effective diameter of 300 mm. It runs at
1000 r.p.m. while the driven pulley runs at 375 r.p.m. The angle of groove on the pulleys is 40°.
Permissible tension in 400 mm2 cross-sectional area belt is 2.1 MPa. The material of the belt has
density of 1100 kg / m3. The driven pulley is overhung, the distance of the centre from the nearest
bearing being 200 mm. The coefficient of friction between belt and pulley rim is 0.28. Estimate: 1. The

Example 20.4. Power of 60 kW at 750 r.p.m. is to be transmitted from an electric motor to

approximate centre distance is 1650 mm, and overload factor is to be taken as 1.5. Give a complete
design of the belt drive. A belt with cross-sectional area of 350 mm2 and density 1000 kg / m3 and
having an allowable tensile strength 2 MPa is available for use. The coefficient of friction between
the belt and the pulley may be taken as 0.28. The driven pulley is overhung to the extent of 300 mm
from the nearest bearing and is mounted on a shaft having a permissible shear stress of 40 MPa with
the help of a key. The shaft, the pulley and the key are also to be designed.

Example 20.5. A V-belt is driven on a flat pulley and a V-pulley. The drive transmits 20 kW
from a 250 mm diameter V-pulley operating at 1800 r.p.m. to a 900 mm diameter flat pulley. The
centre distance is 1 m, the angle of groove 40° and μ = 0.2. If density of belting is 1110 kg / m3 and
allowable stress is 2.1 MPa for belt material, what will be the number of belts required if C-size
V-belts having 230 mm2 cross-sectional area are used.
Solution. Given : P = 20 kW ; d1 = 250 mm = 0.25 m ; N1 = 1800 r.p.m. ; d2 = 900 mm = 0.9 m ;
x = 1 m = 1000 mm ; 2 β = 40° or β = 20° ; μ = 0.2 ; ρ = 1110 kg/m3 ; σ = 2.1 MPa = 2.1 N/mm2 ;

We know that angle of contact on the smaller or V-pulley,
θ1 = 180° – 2 α = 180° – 2 × 18.96 = 142.08°
= 142.08 × π/180 = 2.48 rad
and angle of contact on the larger or flat pulley,
θ2 = 180° + 2α = 180° + 2 × 18.96 = 217.92°
= 217.92 × π / 180 = 3.8 rad
We have already discussed that when the pulleys have different angle of contact (θ), then the
design will refer to a pulley for which μ.θ is small.
We know that for a smaller or V-pulley,
μ.θ = μ.θ1 cosec β = 0.2 × 2.48 × cosec 20° = 1.45
and for larger or flat pulley,
μ.θ = μ.θ2 = 0.2 × 3.8 = 0.76
Since ( μ.θ) for the larger or flat pulley is small, therefore the design is based on the larger or
flat pulley.

20.7 Rope Drives
The rope drives are widely used where a large amount of power is to be transmitted, from one
pulley to another, over a considerable distance. It may be noted that the use of flat belts is limited for
the transmission of moderate power from one pulley to another when the two pulleys are not more
than 8 metres apart. If large amounts of power are to be transmitted, by the flat belt, then it would
result in excessive belt cross-section.
The ropes drives use the following two types of ropes :
1. Fibre ropes, and  2. *Wire ropes.
The fibre ropes operate successfully when the pulleys are about 60 metres apart, while the wire
ropes are used when the pulleys are upto 150 metres apart.
20.8 Fibre Ropes
The ropes for transmitting power are usually made from fibrous materials such as hemp, manila
and cotton. Since the hemp and manila fibres are rough, therefore the ropes made from these fibres
are not very flexible and possesses poor mechanical properties. The hemp ropes have less strength as
compared to manila ropes. When the hemp and manila ropes are bent over the sheave, there is some
sliding of the fibres, causing the rope to wear and chafe internally. In order to minimise this defect, the
rope fibres are lubricated with a tar, tallow or graphite. The lubrication also makes the rope moisture
proof. The hemp ropes are suitable only for hand operated hoisting machinery and as tie ropes for
lifting tackle, hooks etc.
The cotton ropes are very soft and smooth. The lubrication of cotton ropes is not necessary. But
if it is done, it reduces the external wear between the rope and the grooves of its sheaves. It may be
noted that the manila ropes are more durable and stronger than cotton ropes. The cotton ropes are
costlier than manila ropes.

Wire ropes are discussed in Art. 20.12.

Notes : 1. The diameter of manila and cotton ropes usually ranges from 38 mm to 50 mm. The size of the rope
is usually designated by its circumference or ‘girth’.
           2. The ultimate tensile breaking load of the fibre ropes varies greatly. For manila ropes, the average
value of the ultimate tensile breaking load may be taken as 500 d 2 kN and for cotton ropes, it may be taken as
350 d 2 kN, where d is the diameter of rope in mm.
20.9 Advantages of Fibre Rope Drives
The fibre rope drives have the following advantages :
1.
They give smooth, steady and quiet service.
2.
They are little affected by out door conditions.
3.
The shafts may be out of strict alignment.
4.
The power may be taken off in any direction and in fractional parts of the whole amount.
5.
They give high mechanical efficiency.
20.10 Sheave for Fibre Ropes
The fibre ropes are usually circular in cross-section as shown in Fig. 20.6 (a). The sheave for
the fibre ropes, is shown in Fig. 20.6 (b). The groove angle of the pulley for rope drives is usually 45°.
Fig. 20.6. Rope and sheave.
The grooves in the pulleys are made narrow at the bottom and the rope is pinched between the edges
of the V-groove to increase the holding power of the rope on the pulley. The grooves should be
finished smooth to avoid chafing of the rope. The diameter
of the sheaves should be large to reduce the wear on the
rope due to internal friction and bending stresses. The
proper size of sheave wheels is 40 d and the minimum
size is 36 d, where d is the diameter of rope in cm.
Note : The number of grooves should not be more than 24.
20.11 Ratio of Driving Tensions for Fibre
Rope
A fibre rope with a grooved pulley is shown in
Fig. 20.6 (a). The fibre ropes are designed in the similar
way as V-belts. We have discussed in Art. 20.5, that the

Example 20.6. A pulley used to transmit power by means of ropes has a diameter of 3.6 metres
and has 15 grooves of 45° angle. The angle of contact is 170° and the coefficient of friction between
the ropes and the groove sides is 0.28. The maximum possible tension in the ropes is 960 N and the
mass of the rope is 1.5 kg per metre length. Determine the speed of the pulley in r.p.m. and the power
transmitted if the condition of maximum power prevail.
Solution. Given : d = 3.6 m ; n = 15 ; 2 β = 45° or β = 22.5° ; θ = 170° = 170 × π / 180
= 2.967 rad ; μ = 0.28 ; T = 960 N ; m = 1.5 kg / m

Example 20.7. A rope pulley with 10 ropes and a peripheral speed of 1500 m / min transmits
115 kW. The angle of lap for each rope is 180° and the angle of groove is 45°. The coefficient of
friction between the rope and pulley is 0.2. Assuming the rope to be just on the point of slipping, find
the tension in the tight and slack sides of the rope. The mass of each rope is 0.6 kg per metre length.
Solution. Given : n = 10 ; v = 1500 m/min = 25 m/s ; P = 115 kW = 115 × 103 W ; θ = 180°

Let

We know that total power transmitted (P),

∴   Total tension in the tight side of the rope,

Example 20.8. A rope drive transmits 600 kW from a pulley of effective diameter 4 m, which
runs at a speed of 90 r.p.m. The angle of lap is 160°; the angle of groove 45°; the coefficient of
friction 0.28; the mass of rope 1.5 kg / m and the allowable tension in each rope 2400 N. Find the

Solution. Given : P = 600 kW ; d = 4 m ; N = 90 r.p.m. ; θ = 160° = 160 × π/180 = 2.8 rad ;

Example 20.9. A rope drive is to transmit 250 kW from a pulley of 1.2 m diameter, running at
a speed of 300 r.p.m. The angle of lap may be taken as π radians. The groove half angle is 22.5°. The

20.12 Wire Ropes
When a large amount of power is to be transmitted over long distances from one pulley to
another (i.e. when the pulleys are upto 150 metres apart), then wire ropes are used. The wire ropes are
widely used in elevators, mine hoists, cranes, conveyors, hauling devices and suspension bridges.
The wire ropes run on grooved pulleys but they rest on the bottom of the *grooves and are not wedged
between the sides of the grooves.
The wire ropes are made from cold drawn wires in order to have increase in strength and durability.
It may be noted that the strength of the wire rope increases as its size decreases. The various materials
used for wire ropes in order of increasing strength are wrought iron, cast steel, extra strong cast steel,
plough steel and alloy steel. For certain purposes, the wire ropes may also be made of copper, bronze,
aluminium alloys and stainless steels.
20.13 Advantages of Wire Ropes
The wire ropes have the following advantages as compared to fibre ropes.
1.
These are lighter in weight,
2.
These offer silent operation,
3.
These can withstand shock loads,
4.
These are more reliable,
5.
These are more durable,
6.
They do not fail suddenly,
7.
The efficiency is high, and
8.
The cost is low.
20.14 Construction of Wire Ropes
The wire ropes are made from various grades of steel wire having a tensile strength ranging
from 1200 to 2400 MPa as shown in the following table :
Table 20.4. Grade and tensile strength of wires.
Grade of wire
120

1400 – 1700
1600 – 1900
1800 – 2100
2000 – 2400
range (MPa)
The wires are first given special heat treatment and then
cold drawn in order to have high strength and durability of the
rope. The steel wire ropes are manufactured by special
machines. First of all, a number of wires such as 7, 19 or
37 are twisted into a strand and then a number of strands, usually
6 or 8 are twisted about a core or centre to form the rope as
shown in Fig. 20.7. The core may be made of hemp, jute,
asbsestos or a wire of softer steel. The core must be
continuously saturated with lubricant for the long life of the
core as well as the entire rope. The asbestos or soft wire core
is used when ropes are subjected to radiant heat such as cranes
operating near furnaces. However, a wire core reduces the
flexibility of the rope and thus such ropes are used only where
they are subjected to high compression as in the case of several
layers wound over a rope drum.
*
The fibre ropes do not rest at the bottom of the groove.

20.15 Classification of Wire Ropes
According to the direction of twist of the individual wires and that of strands,
relative to each other, the wire ropes may be classified as follows :
1.
Cross or regular lay ropes. In these types of ropes, the direction of twist
of wires in the strands is opposite to the direction of twist of the stands, as
shown in Fig. 20.8 (a). Such type of ropes are most popular.
2.
Parallel or lang lay ropes. In these type of ropes, the direction of twist of
the wires in the strands is same as that of strands in the rope, as shown in
Fig. 20.8 (b). These ropes have better bearing surface but is harder to
splice and twists more easily when loaded. These ropes are more flexible
and resists wear more effectively. Since such ropes have the tendency to
spin, therefore these are used in lifts and hoists with guide ways and also
as haulage ropes.
Fig. 20.8. Wire ropes classified according to the direction of twist of the individual wires.
3.
Composite or reverse laid ropes. In these types of ropes, the wires in the two adjacent
strands are twisted in the opposite direction, as shown in Fig. 20.8 (c).
Note: The direction of the lay of the ropes may be right handed or left handed, depending upon whether the
strands form right hand or left hand helixes, but the right hand lay ropes are most commonly used.
20.16 Designation of Wire Ropes
The wire ropes are designated by the number of strands and the number of wires in each strand.
For example, a wire rope having six strands and seven wires in each strand is designated by 6 × 7
rope. Following table shows the standard designation of ropes and their applications :
Table 20.5. Standard designation of ropes and their applications.

tramways, power transmission.
6 × 19 rope
It is a standard hoisting rope used for hoisting purposes in mines,
quarries, cranes, dredges, elevators, tramways, well drilling.
6 × 37 rope
It is an extra flexible hoisting rope used in steel mill laddles,
cranes, high speed elevators.
8 × 19 rope
It is also an extra flexible hoisting rope.

Extra flexible hoisting rope.
However, if the space allows, then the large
diameters should be employed which give better
and more economical service.
The sheave groove has a great influence on
the life and service of the rope. If the groove is
bigger than rope, there will not be sufficient support
for the rope which may, therefore, flatten from its
normal circular shape and increase fatigue effects.
On the other hand, if the groove is too small, then
the rope will be wedged into the groove and thus
the normal rotation is prevented. The standard rim
of a rope sheave is shown in Fig. 20.9 (a) and a
standard grooved drum for wire ropes is shown
in Fig. 20.9 (b).

For light and medium service, the sheaves are made of cast iron, but for heavy crane service
they are often made of steel castings. The sheaves are usually mounted on fixed axles on antifriction
bearings or bronze bushings.
The small drums in hand hoists are made plain. A hoist operated by a motor or an engine has a
drum with helical grooves, as shown in Fig. 20.9 (b). The pitch ( p ) of the grooves must be made
slightly larger than the rope diameter to avoid friction and wear between the coils.
20.21 Wire Rope Fasteners
The various types of rope fasteners are shown in Fig. 20.10. The splices in wire ropes should be
avoided because it reduces the strength of the rope by 25 to 30 percent of the normal ultimate strength.

20.22 Stresses in Wire Ropes
A wire rope is subjected to the following types of stresses :
1.  Direct stress due to axial load lifted and weight of the rope
Let
W = Load lifted,
w = Weight of the rope, and
A = Net cross-sectional area of the rope.
∴  Direct stress,
σd = W
w
A
+
2.  Bending stress when the rope winds round the sheave or drum. When a wire rope is wound
over the sheave, then the bending stresses are induced in the wire which is tensile at the top and
compressive at the lower side of the wire. The bending stress induced depends upon many factors
such as construction of rope, size of wire, type of centre and the amount of restraint in the grooves.
The approximate value of the bending stress in the wire as proposed by Reuleaux, is
σb =

where
Er = Modulus of elasticity of the wire rope,
dw = Diameter of the wire,
D = Diameter of the sheave or drum, and
A = Net cross-sectional area of the rope.
It may be noted that Er is not the modulus of elasticity for the wire material, but it is of the entire
rope. The value of Er may be taken as 77 kN/mm2 for wrought iron ropes and 84 kN/mm2 for steel
ropes. It has been found experimentally that Er = 3/8 E, where E is the modulus of elasticity of the
wire material.
If σb is the bending stress in each wire, then the load on the whole rope due to bending may be
obtained from the following relation, i.e.
Wb =

supported load are to be accelerated. This induces additional load in the rope which is given by

where
a = Acceleration of the rope and load, and
g = Acceleration due to gravity.
If the time (t) necessary to attain a speed (v) is known, then the value of ‘a’ is given by
a = v / 60 t
The general case of starting is when the rope has a slack (h) which must be overcome before the
rope is taut and starts to exert a pull on the load. This induces an impact load on the rope.
The impact load on starting may be obtained by the impact equation, i.e.
Wst =

and velocity of the rope (vr) at the instant when the rope is taut,
vr =
2a
h
×
where
a = Acceleration of the rope and load,
h = Slackness in the rope, and
l = Length of the rope.
When there is no slackness in the rope, then h = 0 and vr = 0, therefore
Impact load during starting,
Wst = 2 (W + w)
and the corresponding stress,
σst = 2 (

4. Stress due to change in speed. The additional stress due to change in speed may be obtained
in the similar way as discussed above in which the acceleration is given by
a = (v2 – v1) / t
where (v2 – v1 ) is the change in speed in m/s and t is the time in seconds.
It may be noted that when the hoist drum is suddenly stopped while lowering the load, it produces
a stress that is several times more than the direct or static stress because of the kinetic energy of the
moving masses is suddenly made zero. This kinetic energy is absorbed by the rope and the resulting
stress may be determined by equating the kinetic energy to the resilience of the rope. If during stopping,
the load moves down a certain distance, the corresponding change of potential energy must be added
to the kinetic energy. It is also necessary to add the work of stretching the rope during stopping, which
may be obtained from the impact stress.
5. Effective stress. The sum of the direct stress (σd) and the bending stress (σb) is called the
effective stress in the rope during normal working. Mathematically,
Effective stress in the rope during normal working
= σd + σb
Effective stress in the rope during starting
= σst + σb
and effective stress in the rope during acceleration of the load
= σd + σb + σa

While designing a wire rope, the sum of these stresses should be less than the ultimate strength
divided by the factor of safety.
20.23 Procedure for Designing a Wire Rope
The following procedure may be followed while designing a wire rope.
1.
First of all, select a suitable type of rope from Tables 20.6, 20.7, 20.8 and 20.9 for the given
application.
2.
Find the design load by assuming a factor of
safety 2 to 2.5 times the factor of safety given
in Table 20.11.
3.
Find the diameter of wire rope (d) by equating
the tensile strength of the rope selected to the
design load.
4.
Find the diameter of the wire (dw) and area of
the rope (A) from Table 20.10.
5.
Find the various stresses (or loads) in the rope
as discussed in Art. 20.22.
6.
Find the effective stresses (or loads) during
normal working, during starting and during
acceleration of the load.
7.
Now find the actual factor of safety and
compare with the factor of safety given in
Table 20.11. If the actual factor of safety is
within permissible limits, then the design is
safe.

Example 20.10. Select a wire rope for a vertical mine hoist to lift a load of 55 kN from a depth
300 metres. A rope speed of 500 metres / min is to be attained in 10 seconds.
Solution. Given : W = 55 kN = 55 000 N ; Depth = 300 m ; v = 500 m/min ; t = 10 s
The following procedure may be adopted in selecting a wire rope for a vertical mine hoist.
1.
From Table 20.6, we find that the wire ropes for haulage purposes in mines are of two types,
i.e. 6 × 7 and 6 × 19. Let us take a rope of type 6 × 19.
2.
From Table 20.11, we find that the factor of safety for mine hoists from 300 to 600 m depth
is 7. Since the design load is calculated by taking a factor of safety 2 to 2.5 times the factor
of safety given in Table 20.11, therefore let us take the factor of safety as 15.
∴ Design load for the wire rope
= 15 × 55 = 825 kN = 825 000 N
3.
From Table 20.6, we find that the tensile strength of 6 × 19 rope made of wire with tensile
strength of 1800 MPa is 595 d2 (in newton), where d is the diameter of rope in mm. Equat-
ing this tensile strength to the design load, we get
                                            595 d2 = 825 000
∴
        d 2 = 825 000 / 595 = 1386.5 or  d = 37.2 say 38 mm
4.
From Table 20.10, we find that for a 6 × 19 rope,
Diameter of wire,         dw  = 0.063 d = 0.063 × 38 = 2.4 mm
and area of rope,                           A = 0.38 d2 = 0.38 (38)2 = 550 mm2
5.
Now let us find out the various loads in the rope as discussed below :
(a) From Table 20.6, we find that weight of the rope,
       w = 0.0363 d2 = 0.0363 (38)2 = 52.4 N/m
= 52.4 × 300 = 15 720 N
...(Q Depth = 300 m)
(b) From Table 20.12, we find that diameter of the sheave (D) may be taken as 60 to 100
times the diameter of rope ( d ). Let us take
          D = 100 d = 100 × 38 = 3800 mm

...(Taking Er = 84 × 103 N/mm2)
and the equivalent bending load on the rope,

(c) We know that the acceleration of the rope and load,
a = v / 60t = 500 / 60 × 10 = 0.83 m / s2
∴Additional load due to acceleration,

(d) We know that the impact load during starting (when there is no slackness in the rope),
Wst = 2 (W + w) = 2(55 000 + 15 720) = 141 440 N
6.
We know that the effective load on the rope during normal working (i.e. during uniform
lifting or lowering of the load)
= W + w + Wb = 55 000 + 15 720 + 29150 = 99 870 N

Since the actual factor of safety as calculated above are safe, therefore a wire rope of diameter
38 mm and 6 × 19 type is satisfactory. Ans.
A vertical hoist with metal ropes
Example 20.11. An extra flexible 8 × 19 plough steel wire rope of 38 mm diameter is used with
a 2m diameter hoist drum to lift 50 kN of load. Find the factor of safety (ratio of the breaking load to
the maximum working load) under the following conditions of operation :
The wire rope is required to lift from a depth of 900 metres. The maximum speed is 3 m / s and
the acceleration is 1.5 m / s2, when starting under no slack condition. The diameter of the wire may
be taken as 0.05 d, where d is the diameter of wire rope. The breaking strength of plough steel is
1880 N/mm2 and modulus of elasticity of the entire rope is 84 × 103 N/mm2. The weight of the rope
is 53 N/m length.
Solution. Given : d = 38 mm ; D = 2 m = 2000 mm ; W = 50 kN = 50 000 N ; Depth = 900 m ;
v = 3 m/s ; a = 1.5 m/s2 ; dw = 0.05 d ; Breaking strength = 1880 N/mm2 ; Er = 84 × 103 N/mm2 ;
w = 53 N/m = 53 × 900 = 47 700 N

Example 20.12. A workshop crane is lifting a load of 25 kN through a wire rope and a hook.
The weight of the hook etc. is 15 kN. The rope drum diameter may be taken as 30 times the diameter

rope. Take a factor of safety of 6 and Young’s modulus for the wire rope 80 kN/mm2. The ultimate
stress may be taken as 1800 MPa. The cross-sectional area of the wire rope may be taken as 0.38

21.1 Introduction
We have seen in previous chapters on belt and rope
drives that slipping may occur. In order to avoid slipping,
steel chains are used. The chains are made up of number of
rigid links which are hinged together by pin joints in order
to provide the necessary flexibility for wraping round the
driving and driven wheels. These wheels have projecting
teeth of special profile and fit into the corresponding recesses
in the links of the chain as shown in Fig. 21.1. The toothed
wheels are known as *sprocket wheels or simply sprockets.
The sprockets and the chain are thus constrained to move
together without slipping and ensures perfect velocity ratio.
*  These wheels resemble to spur gears.

Fig. 21.1. Sprockets and chain.
The chains are mostly used to transmit motion and power from one shaft to another, when the
centre distance between their shafts is short such as in bicycles, motor cycles, agricultural machinery,
conveyors, rolling mills, road rollers etc. The chains may also be used for long centre distance of upto
8 metres. The chains are used for velocities up to 25 m / s and for power upto 110 kW. In some cases,
higher power transmission is also possible.
21.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Chain Drive over Belt or Rope Drive
Following are the advantages and disadvantages of chain drive over belt or rope drive:
Advantages
1. As no slip takes place during chain drive, hence perfect velocity ratio is obtained.
2. Since the chains are made of metal, therefore they occupy less space in width than a belt or
rope drive.
3. It may be used for both long as well as short distances.
4. It gives a high transmission efficiency (upto 98 percent).
5. It gives less load on the shafts.
6. It has the ability to transmit motion to several shafts by one chain only.
7. It transmits more power than belts.
8. It permits high speed ratio of 8 to 10 in one step.
9. It can be operated under adverse temperature and atmospheric conditions.
Disadvantages
1. The production cost of chains is relatively high.
2. The chain drive needs accurate mounting and careful maintenance, particularly lubrication
and slack adjustment.
3. The chain drive has velocity fluctuations especially when unduly stretched.

21.3 Terms Used in Chain Drive
The following terms are frequently used in chain drive.
1. Pitch of  chain.  It is the distance between the hinge centre of a link and the corresponding
hinge centre of the adjacent link, as shown in Fig. 21.2. It is usually denoted by p.
Fig. 21.2. Terms used in chain drive.
2. Pitch circle diameter of chain sprocket. It is the diameter of the circle on which the hinge
centres of the chain lie, when the chain is wrapped round a sprocket as shown in Fig. 21.2. The
points A, B, C, and D are the hinge centres of the chain and the circle drawn through these
centres is called pitch circle and its diameter (D) is known as pitch circle diameter.
21.4 Relation Between Pitch and Pitch Circle Diameter
A chain wrapped round the sprocket is shown in Fig. 21.2. Since the links of the chain are rigid,
therefore pitch of the chain does not lie on the arc of the pitch circle. The pitch length becomes a
chord. Consider one pitch length AB of the chain subtending an angle θ at the centre of sprocket
(or pitch circle),
Let
D = Diameter of the pitch circle, and
T = Number of teeth on the sprocket.
From Fig. 21.2, we find that pitch of the chain,
p = AB = 2 A O sin 2

where d1 and d2 are the diameters of the pitch circles of the smaller and larger sprockets.
2.  For best results, the minimum centre distance should be 30 to 50 times the pitch.
3.  The minimum centre distance is selected depending upon the velocity ratio so that the arc of contact of
the chain on the smaller sprocket is not less than 120º. It may be noted that larger angle of arc of contact ensures
a more uniform distribution of load on the sprocket teeth and better conditions of engagement.
21.7 Classification of Chains
The chains, on the basis of their use, are classified into the following three groups:
1. Hoisting and hauling (or crane) chains,
2. Conveyor (or tractive) chains, and
3.  Power transmitting (or driving) chains.
These chains are discussed, in detail, in the following pages.
21.8 Hoisting and Hauling Chains
These chains are used for hoisting and hauling purposes and operate at a maximum velocity of
0.25 m / s. The hoisting and hauling chains are of the following two types:
1. Chain with oval links. The links of this type of chain are of oval shape, as shown in Fig. 21.4
(a). The joint of each link is welded. The sprockets which are used for this type of chain have receptacles
to receive the links. Such type of chains are used only at low speeds such as in chain hoists and in
anchors for marine works.
Fig. 21.4. Hoisting and hauling chains.
2. Chain with square links. The links of this type of chain are of square shape, as shown in Fig.
21.4 (b). Such type of chains are used in hoists, cranes, dredges. The manufacturing cost of this type
of chain is less than that of chain with oval links, but in these chains, the kinking occurs easily on
overloading.
21.9 Conveyor Chains
These chains are used for elevating and conveying the materials continuously at a speed upto
2 m / s. The conveyor chains are of the following two types:
1.
Detachable or hook joint type chain, as shown in Fig. 21.5 (a), and
2.
Closed joint type chain, as shown in Fig. 21.5 (b).
Fig. 21.5. Conveyor chains.

764    A Textbook of Machine Design
The conveyor chains are usually made of malleable cast iron. These chains do not have smooth
running qualities. The conveyor chains run at slow speeds of about 0.8 to 3 m / s.
21.10 Power Transmitting Chains
These chains are used for transmission of power, when the distance between the centres of
shafts is short. These chains have provision for efficient lubrication. The power transmitting chains
are of the following three types.
1. Block or bush chain. A block or bush chain is shown in Fig. 21.6. This type of chain was
used in the early stages of development in the power transmission.
Fig. 21.6. Block or bush chain.
It produces noise when approaching or leaving the teeth of the sprocket because of rubbing
between the teeth and the links. Such type of chains are used to some extent as conveyor chain at
small speed.
2. Bush roller chain. A bush roller chain as shown in Fig. 21.7, consists of outer plates or pin
link plates, inner plates or roller link plates, pins, bushes and rollers. A pin passes through the bush
which is secured in the holes of the roller between the two sides of the chain. The rollers are free to
rotate on the bush which protect the sprocket wheel teeth against wear. The pins, bushes and rollers
are made of alloy steel.
Fig. 21.7. Bush roller chain.
A bush roller chain is extremely strong and simple in construction. It gives good service under
severe conditions. There is a little noise with this chain which is due to impact of the rollers on the
sprocket wheel teeth. This chain may be used where there is a little lubrication. When one of these
chains elongates slightly due to wear and stretching of the parts, then the extended chain is of greater
pitch than the pitch of the sprocket wheel teeth. The rollers then fit unequally into the cavities of the
wheel. The result is that the total load falls on one teeth or on a few teeth. The stretching of the parts
increase wear of the surfaces of the roller and of the sprocket wheel teeth.

The roller chains are standardised and manufactured on the basis of pitch. These chains are
available in single-row or multi-row roller chains such as simple, duplex or triplex strands, as shown
in Fig. 21.8.
Fig. 21.8. Types of roller chain.
3. Silent chain. A silent chain (also known as inverted tooth chain) is shown in Fig. 21.9.

It is designed to eliminate the evil effects caused by stretching and to produce noiseless
running. When the chain stretches and the pitch of the chain increases, the links ride on the teeth
of the sprocket wheel at a slightly increased radius. This automatically corrects the small change
in the pitch. There is no relative sliding between the teeth of the inverted tooth chain and the
sprocket wheel teeth. When properly lubricated, this chain gives durable service and runs very
smoothly and quietly.
The various types of joints used in a silent chain are shown in Fig. 21.10.
Fig. 21.10. Silent chain joints.
21.11 Characteristics of Roller Chains
According to Indian Standards (IS: 2403 —1991), the various characteristics such as pitch,
roller diameter, width between inner plates, transverse pitch and breaking load for the roller chains
are given in the following table.

21.12 Factor of Safety for Chain Drives
The factor of safety for chain drives is defined as the ratio of the breaking strength (WB ) of the
chain to the total load on the driving side of the chain ( W ). Mathematically,
Factor of safety = 
B
W
W
The breaking strength of the chain may be obtained by the following empirical relations, i.e.
WB = 106 p2 (in newtons) for roller chains
= 106 p (in newtons) per mm width of chain for silent chains.
where p is the pitch in mm.
The total load (or total tension) on the driving side of the chain is the sum of the tangential
driving force (FT), centrifugal tension in the chain (FC) and the tension in the chain due to sagging
(FS).
We know that the tangential driving force acting on the chain,
FT = Power transmitted (in watts)
Speed of chain in m /s
P
v
=
  (in newtons)
Centrifugal tension in the chain,
FC = m.v2 (in newtons)
and tension in the chain due to sagging,
FS = k.mg.x (in newtons)
where
m = Mass of the chain in kg per metre length,
x = Centre distance in metres, and
k = Constant which takes into account the arrangement of chain drive
= 2 to 6, when the centre line of the chain is inclined to the horizontal
at an angle less than 40º
= 1 to 1.5, when the centre line of the chain is inclined to the horizontal
at an angle greater than 40º.
The following table shows the factor of safety for the bush roller and silent chains depending
upon the speed of the sprocket pinion in r.p.m. and pitch of the chains.

The service factor (KS) is the product of various factors, such as load factor (K1), lubrication
factor (K2) and rating factor (K3). The values of these factors are taken as follows:
1. Load factor (K1)
= 1, for constant load
= 1.25, for variable load with mild shock
= 1.5, for heavy shock loads
2. Lubrication factor (K2) = 0.8, for continuous lubrication
= 1, for drop lubrication
= 1.5, for periodic lubrication
3. Rating factor (K3)
= 1, for 8 hours per day
= 1.25, for 16 hours per day
= 1.5, for continuous service
21.15 Number of Teeth on the Smaller or Driving Sprocket or Pinion
Consider an arrangement of a chain drive in which the smaller or driving sprocket has only four
teeth, as shown in Fig. 21.11 (a). Let the sprocket rotates anticlockwise at a constant speed of N r.p.m.
The chain link AB is at a distance of d / 2 from the centre of the sprocket and its linear speed is given by

where

When the sprocket rotates through an angle θ/2, the link AB occupies the position as shown in

From above, we see that the linear velocity of the sprocket is not uniform but varies from
maximum to minimum during every cycle of tooth engagement. This results in fluctuations in chain
transmission and may be minimised by reducing the angle θ or by increasing the number of teeth on
the sprocket. It has been observed that for a sprocket having 11 teeth, the variation of speed is
4 percent and for the sprockets having 17 teeth and 24 teeth, the variation of speed is 1.6 percent and
1 percent respectively.
In order to have smooth operation, the minimum number of teeth on the smaller sprocket or
pinion may be taken as 17 for moderate speeds and 21 for high speeds. The following table shows the
number of teeth on a smaller sprocket for different velocity ratios.

Note: The number of teeth on the smaller sprocket plays an important role in deciding the performance of a
chain drive. A small number of teeth tends to make the drive noisy. A large number of teeth makes chain pitch
smaller which is favourable for keeping the drive silent and reducing shock, centrifugal force and friction force.

teeth on the smaller sprocket or pinion and the chain pitch is shown in the following table.

21.18 Design Procedure of Chain Drive
The chain drive is designed as discussed below:
1. First of all, determine the velocity ratio of the chain drive.
2. Select the minimum number of teeth on the smaller sprocket or pinion from Table 21.5.
3. Find the number of teeth on the larger sprocket.
4. Determine the design power by using the service factor, such that
Design power = Rated power × Service factor
5. Choose the type of chain, number of strands for the design power and r.p.m. of the smaller
sprocket from Table 21.4.
6. Note down the parameters of the chain, such as pitch, roller diameter, minimum width of
roller etc. from Table 21.1.
7. Find pitch circle diameters and pitch line velocity of the smaller sprocket.
8. Determine the load (W) on the chain by using the following relation, i.e.
W = 
Rated power
Pitch line velocity
9. Calculate the factor of safety by dividing the breaking load (WB) to the load on the chain
( W ). This value of factor of safety should be greater than the value given in Table 21.2.
10. Fix the centre distance between the sprockets.
11. Determine the length of the chain.
12. The other dimensions may be fixed as given in Art. 21.17.
Example 21.1. Design a chain drive to actuate a compressor from 15 kW electric motor
running at 1000 r.p.m., the compressor speed being 350 r.p.m. The minimum centre distance is
500 mm. The compressor operates 16 hours per day. The chain tension may be adjusted by
shifting the motor on slides.

N
 = 1000
350  = 2.86 say 3
From Table 21.5, we find that for the roller chain, the number of teeth on the smaller sprocket or

∴  Number of teeth on the larger sprocket or gear,
T2 = T1 ×

N
N
 = 25 × 
1000
350   = 71.5 say 72 Ans.
We know that the design power
= Rated power × Service factor (K S )
The service factor (KS ) is the product of various factors K1, K2 and K3. The values of these
factors are taken as follows:
Load factor (K1) for variable load with heavy shock
= 1.5
Lubrication factor (K2) for drop lubrication
= 1
Rating factor (K3) for 16 hours per day
= 1.25
∴ Service factor,
KS = K1.K2.K3 = 1.5 × 1 × 1.25 = 1.875
and design power
= 15 × 1.875 = 28.125 kW
From Table 21.4, we find that corresponding to a pinion speed of 1000 r.p.m. the power
transmitted for chain No. 12 is 15.65 kW per strand. Therefore, a chain No. 12 with two strands can
be used to transmit the required power. From Table 21.1, we find that

the pitch. Let us take it as 30 times the pitch.
∴ Centre distance between the sprockets,
= 30 p = 30 × 19.05 = 572 mm
In order to accomodate initial sag in the chain, the value of centre distance is reduced by 2 to 5 mm.
∴ Correct centre distance

22.1 Introduction
A flywheel used in machines serves as a reservior
which stores energy during the period when the supply of
energy is more than the requirement and releases it during
the period when the requirement of energy is more than
supply.
In case of steam engines, internal combustion engines,
reciprocating compressors and pumps, the energy is
developed during one stroke and the engine is to run for
the whole cycle on the energy produced during this one
stroke. For example, in I.C. engines, the energy is developed
only during power stroke which is much more than the
engine load, and no energy is being developed during
suction, compression and exhaust strokes in case of four
stroke engines and during compression in case of two stroke
engines. The excess energy developed during power stroke
is absorbed by the flywheel and releases it to the crankshaft
during other strokes in which no energy is developed, thus

Flywheel     777
rotating the crankshaft at a uniform speed. A little consideration will show that when the flywheel
absorbs energy, its speed increases and when it releases, the speed decreases. Hence a flywheel does
not maintain a constant speed, it simply reduces the fluctuation of speed.
In machines where the operation is intermittent like punching machines, shearing machines,
riveting machines, crushers etc., the flywheel stores energy from the power source during the greater
portion of the operating cycle and gives it up during a small period of the cycle. Thus the energy from
the power source to the machines is supplied practically at a constant rate throughout the operation.
Note: The function of a governor in engine
is entirely different from that of a flywheel.
It regulates the mean speed of an engine
when there are variations in the load, e.g.
when the load on the engine increases, it
becomes necessary to increase the supply of
working fluid. On the other hand, when the
load decreases, less working fluid is required.
The governor automatically controls the
supply of working fluid to the engine with
the varying load condition and keeps the
mean speed within certain limits.
As discussed above, the flywheel does
not maintain a constant speed, it simply
reduces the fluctuation of speed. In other
words, a flywheel controls the speed variations caused by the fluctuation of the engine turning moment during
each cycle of operation. It does not control the speed variations caused by the varying load.
22.2 Coefficient of Fluctuation of Speed
The difference between the maximum and minimum speeds during a cycle is called the maximum
fluctuation of speed. The ratio of the maximum fluctuation of speed to the mean speed is called
coefficient of fluctuation of speed.
Let
N1 = Maximum speed in r.p.m. during the cycle,
N2 = Minimum speed in r.p.m. during the cycle, and
N = Mean speed in r.p.m. =

22.3 Fluctuation of Energy
The fluctuation of energy may be determined by the turning moment diagram for one complete
cycle of operation. Consider a turning moment diagram for a single cylinder double acting steam
engine as shown in Fig. 22.1. The vertical ordinate represents the turning moment and the horizontal
ordinate (abscissa) represents the crank angle.
A little consideration will show that the turning moment is zero when the crank angle is zero. It
rises to a maximum value when crank angle reaches 90º and it is again zero when crank angle is 180º.
This is shown by the curve abc in Fig. 22.1 and it represents the turning moment diagram for outstroke.
The curve cde is the turning moment diagram for instroke and is somewhat similar to the curve abc.
Since the work done is the product of the turning moment and the angle turned, therefore the
area of the turning moment diagram represents the work done per revolution. In actual practice, the
engine is assumed to work against the mean resisting torque, as shown by a horizontal line AF. The
height of the ordinate aA represents the mean height of the turning moment diagram. Since it is
assumed that the work done by the turning moment per revolution is equal to the work done against
the mean resisting torque, therefore the area of the rectangle aA Fe is proportional to the work done
against the mean resisting torque.
Fig. 22.1. Turning moment diagram for a single cylinder double acting steam engine.
We see in Fig. 22.1, that the mean resisting torque line AF cuts the turning moment diagram at
points B, C, D and E. When the crank moves from ‘a’ to ‘p’ the work done by the engine is equal to
Contents
Top
Flywheel     779
the area aBp, whereas the energy required is represented by the area aABp. In other words, the engine
has done less work (equal to the area aAB) than the requirement. This amount of energy is taken from
the flywheel and hence the speed of the flywheel decreases. Now the crank moves from p to q, the
work done by the engine is equal to the area pBbCq, whereas the requirement of energy is represented
by the area pBCq. Therefore the engine has done more work than the requirement. This excess work
(equal to the area BbC) is stored in the flywheel and hence the speed of the flywheel increases while
the crank moves from p to q.
Similarly when the crank moves from q to r, more work is taken from the engine than is developed.
This loss of work is represented by the area CcD. To supply this loss, the flywheel gives up some of
its energy and thus the speed decreases while the crank moves from q to r. As the crank moves from
r to s, excess energy is again developed given by the area DdE and the speed again increases. As the
piston moves from s to e, again there is a loss of work and the speed decreases. The variations of
energy above and below the mean resisting torque line are called fluctuation of energy. The areas
BbC, CcD, DdE etc. represent fluctuations of energy.
Fig. 22.2. Tunring moment diagram for a four stroke internal combustion engine.
A little consideration will show that the engine has
a maximum speed either at q or at s. This is due to the
fact that the flywheel absorbs energy while the crank
moves from p to q and from r to s. On the other hand,
the engine has a minimum speed either at p or at r. The
reason is that the flywheel gives out some of its energy
when the crank moves from a to p and from q to r. The
difference between the maximum and the minimum
energies is known as maximum fluctuation of energy.
A turning moment diagram for a four stroke
internal combustion engine is shown in Fig. 22.2. We
know that in a four stroke internal combustion engine,
there is one working stroke after the crank has turned
through 720º (or 4π radians). Since the pressure inside the engine cylinder is less than the atmospheric
pressure during suction stroke, therefore a negative loop is formed as shown in Fig. 22.2. During the
compression stroke, the work is done on the gases, therefore a higher negative loop is obtained. In the
working stroke, the fuel burns and the gases expand, therefore a large positive loop is formed. During
exhaust stroke, the work is done on the gases, therefore a negative loop is obtained.

turning moment diagram is shown in Fig. 22.3. The resultant turning moment diagram is the sum of

the turning moment diagrams for the three cylinders. It may be noted that the first cylinder is the high
pressure cylinder, second cylinder is the intermediate cylinder and the third cylinder is the low pressure
cylinder. The cranks, in case of three cylinders are usually placed at 120º to each other.

22.4 Maximum Fluctuation of Energy
A turning moment diagram for a multi-cylinder engine is shown by a wavy curve in Fig. 22.4.
The horizontal line AG represents the mean torque line. Let a1, a3, a5 be the areas above the mean
torque line and a2, a4 and a6 be the areas below the mean torque line. These areas represent some
quantity of energy which is either added or subtracted from the energy of the moving parts of the
engine.
Fig. 22.4. Turning moment diagram for a multi-cylinder engine.
Let the energy in the flywheel at A = E, then from Fig. 22.4, we have
Energy at B = E + a1
Energy at C = E + a1 – a2
Energy at D = E + a1 – a2 + a3
Energy at E = E + a1 – a2 + a3 – a4
Energy at F = E + a1 – a2 + a3 – a4 + a5
Energy at G = E + a1 – a2 + a3 – a4 + a5 – a6 = Energy at A
Let us now suppose that the maximum of these energies is at B and minimum at E.
∴  Maximum energy in the flywheel
= E + a1
and minimum energy in the flywheel
= E + a1 – a2 + a3 – a4
Contents
Top
Flywheel     781
∴  Maximum fluctuation of energy,
ΔE = Maximum energy – Minimum energy
= (E + a1) – (E + a1 – a2 + a3 – a4) = a2 – a3 + a4
22.5 Coefficient of Fluctuation of Energy
It is defined as the ratio of the maximum fluctuation of energy to the work done per cycle. It is
usually denoted by CE. Mathematically, coefficient of fluctuation of energy,
CE = Maximum fluctuation of energy
Work done per cycle
The workdone per cycle may be obtained by using the following relations:
1. Workdone / cycle
= Tmean × θ
where
Tmean = Mean torque, and
θ = Angle turned in radians per revolution
= 2 π, in case of steam engines and two stroke internal combustion
engines.
= 4 π, in case of four stroke internal combustion engines.
The mean torque (Tmean) in N-m may be obtained by using the following relation i.e.

The radius of gyration (k) may be taken equal to the mean radius of the rim (R), because the
thickness of rim is very small as compared to the diameter of rim. Therefore substituting k = R in
equation (ii), we have
Δ E = m.R2.ω2.CS = m.v2.CS
...(Q v = ω.R )
From this expression, the mass of the flywheel rim may be determined.
Notes: 1. In the above expression, only the mass moment of inertia of the rim is considered and the mass
moment of inertia of the hub and arms is neglected. This is due to the fact that the major portion of weight of the
flywheel is in the rim and a small portion is in the hub and arms. Also the hub and arms are nearer to the axis of
rotation, therefore the moment of inertia of the hub and arms is very small.
2. The density of cast iron may be taken as 7260 kg / m3 and for cast steel, it may taken as 7800 kg / m3.
3. The mass of the flywheel rim is given by
m = Volume × Density = 2 π R × A × ρ

Flywheel     783
From this expression, we may find the value of the cross-sectional area of the rim. Assuming the
cross-section of the rim to be rectangular, then
A = b × t
where
b = Width of the rim, and
t = Thickness of the rim.
Knowing the ratio of b / t which is usually taken as 2, we may find the width and thickness of rim.
4. When the flywheel is to be used as a pulley, then the width of rim should be taken 20 to 40 mm greater
than the width of belt.
Example 22.1. The turning moment diagram for a petrol engine is drawn to the following
scales:
Turning moment, 1 mm = 5 N-m;
Crank angle, 1 mm = 1º.
The turning moment diagram repeats
itself at every half revolution of the engine
and the areas above and below the mean
turning moment line, taken in order are
295, 685, 40, 340, 960, 270 mm2.
Determine the mass of 300 mm
diameter flywheel rim when the coefficient
of fluctuation of speed is 0.3% and the
engine runs at 1800 r.p.m. Also determine
the cross-section of the rim when the width
of the rim is twice of thickness. Assume
density of rim material as 7250 kg / m3.
Solution. Given : D = 300 mm or
R = 150 mm = 0.15 m ; CS = 0.3% = 0.003 ; N = 1800 r.p.m. or ω = 2 π × 1800 / 60 = 188.5 rad/s ;
ρ = 7250 kg / m3
Mass of the flywheel
Let
m = Mass of the flywheel in kg.
First of all, let us find the maximum fluctuation of energy. The turning moment diagram is
shown in Fig. 22.6.
Since the scale of turning moment is 1 mm = 5 N-m, and scale of the crank angle is 1 mm = 1°
= π / 180 rad, therefore 1 mm2 on the turning moment diagram.
= 5 × π / 180 = 0.087 N-m
Let the total energy at A = E. Therefore from Fig. 22.6, we find that
Energy at B = E + 295
Energy at C = E + 295 – 685 = E – 390
Energy at D = E – 390 + 40 = E – 350
Energy at E = E – 350 – 340 = E – 690
Energy at F = E – 690 + 960 = E + 270
Energy at G = E + 270 – 270 = E = Energy at A
From above we see that the energy is maximum at B and minimum at E.
∴  Maximum energy
= E + 295
and minimum energy
= E – 690
Contents
Top
784    A Textbook of Machine Design
We know that maximum fluctuation of energy,
Δ E = Maximum energy — Minimum energy
= (E + 295) – (E – 690) = 985 mm2
= 985 × 0.087 = 86 N-m
We also know that maximum fluctuation of energy (Δ E),
86 = m.R2.ω2.CS = m (0.15)2 (188.5)2 (0.003) = 2.4 m
∴
m = 86 / 2.4 = 35.8 kg Ans.

Cross-section of the flywheel rim
Let
t = Thickness of rim in metres, and
b = Width of rim in metres = 2 t

∴ Cross-sectional area of rim,

We know that mass of the flywheel rim (m),
35.8 = A × 2πR × ρ = 2t2 × 2π × 0.15 × 7250 = 13 668 t2
∴
t2 = 35.8 / 13 668 = 0.0026   or  t = 0.051 m = 51 mm Ans.
and
b = 2 t = 2 × 51 = 102 mm Ans.
Example 22.2. The intercepted areas between the output torque curve and the mean resistance
line of a turning moment diagram for a multicylinder engine, taken in order from one end are as
follows:
– 35, + 410, – 285, + 325, – 335, + 260, – 365, + 285, – 260 mm2.
The diagram has been drawn to a scale of 1 mm = 70 N-m and 1 mm = 4.5°. The engine speed
is 900 r.p.m. and the fluctuation in speed is not to exceed 2% of the mean speed.
Find the mass and cross-section of the flywheel rim having 650 mm mean diameter. The density
of the material of the flywheel may be taken as 7200 kg / m3. The rim is rectangular with the width

Fig. 22.7
Let the total energy at A = E. Therefore from Fig. 22.7, we find that
Energy at B =  E – 35
Energy at C = E – 35 + 410 = E + 375
Energy at D = E + 375 – 285 = E + 90
Energy at E = E + 90 + 325 = E + 415
Energy at F =  E + 415 – 335 = E + 80
Energy at G = E + 80 + 260 = E + 340
Energy at H = E + 340 – 365 = E – 25
Energy at K = E – 25 + 285 = E + 260
Energy at L = E + 260 – 260 = E = Energy at A
From above, we see that the energy is maximum at E and minimum at B.
∴ Maximum energy
= E + 415
and minimum energy
= E – 35
We know that maximum fluctuation of energy,
= (E + 415) – (E – 35) = 450 mm2
= 450 × 5.5 = 2475 N-m
We also know that maximum fluctuation of energy (ΔE),
2475 = m.R2.ω2.CS = m (0.325)2 (94.26)2 0.02 = 18.77 m
∴
m = 2475 / 18.77 = 132 kg Ans.
Cross-section of the flywheel rim
Let
t = Thickness of the rim in metres, and
b = Width of the rim in metres = 2 t
...(Given)
∴ Area of cross-section of the rim,
A = b × t = 2 t × t = 2 t2
We know that mass of the flywheel rim (m),
132 = A × 2 π R × ρ = 2 t2 × 2 π × 0.325 × 7200 = 29 409 t2
∴
t2 = 132 / 29 409 = 0.0044   or   t = 0.067 m = 67 mm Ans.
and
b = 2t = 2 × 67 = 134 mm Ans.
Example 22.3. A single cylinder double acting steam engine develops 150 kW at a mean speed
of 80 r.p.m. The coefficient of fluctuation of energy is 0.1 and the fluctuation of speed is ±  2% of
mean speed. If the mean diameter of the flywheel rim is 2 metres and the hub and spokes provide 5
percent of the rotational inertia of the wheel, find the mass of the flywheel and cross-sectional area
of the rim. Assume the density of the flywheel material (which is cast iron) as 7200 kg / m3.

∴ Maximum fluctuation of energy,
ΔE = CE × Workdone / cycle
= 0.1 × 112 500 = 11 250 N-m
Since 5% of the rotational inertia is provided by hub and spokes, therefore the maximum
fluctuation of energy of the flywheel rim will be 95% of the flywheel.
∴  Maximum fluctuation of energy of the rim,
(Δ E)rim = 0.95 × 11 250 = 10 687.5 N-m
We know that maximum fluctuation of energy of the rim (Δ E)rim,
10 687.5 = m.R2.ω2.CS = m × 12 (8.4)2 0.04 = 2.82 m
∴
m = 10 687.5 / 2.82 = 3790 kg Ans.
Cross-sectional area of the rim
Let
A = Cross-sectional area of the rim.
We know that the mass of the flywheel rim (m),
3790 = A × 2πR × ρ = A × 2π × 1 × 7200 = 45 245 A
∴
A = 3790 / 45 245 = 0.084 m2 Ans.
Example 22.4. A single cylinder, single acting, four stroke oil engine develops 20 kW at
300 r.p.m. The workdone by the gases during the expansion stroke is 2.3 times the workdone on the
gases during the compression and the workdone during the suction and exhaust strokes is negligible.
The speed is to be maintained within ± 1%. Determine the mass moment of inertia of the flywheel.
Solution. Given : P = 20 kW = 20 × 103 W ; N = 300 r.p.m. or ω = 2π × 300 / 60

From equations (i) and (ii), we have
WE = 8000 / 0.565 = 14 160 N-m

22.7 Stresses in a Flywheel Rim
A flywheel, as shown in Fig. 22.9, consists of a
rim at which the major portion of the mass or weight
of flywheel is concentrated, a boss or hub for fixing
the flywheel on to the shaft and a number of arms for
supporting the rim on the hub.
The following types of stresses are induced in
the rim of a flywheel:
1. Tensile stress due to centrifugal force,
2. Tensile bending stress caused by the restraint
of the arms, and
3. The shrinkage stresses due to unequal rate
of cooling of casting. These stresses may be
very high but there is no easy method of de-
termining. This stress is taken care of by a
factor of safety.
We shall now discuss the first two types of
stresses as follows:
1. Tensile stress due to the centrifugal force
The tensile stress in the rim due to the centrifugal force, assuming that the rim is unstrained by
the arms, is determined in a similar way as a thin cylinder subjected to internal pressure.
Let
b = Width of rim,
t = Thickness of rim,

A = Cross-sectional area of rim = b × t,
D = Mean diameter of flywheel
R = Mean radius of flywheel,
ρ = Density of flywheel material,
ω = Angular speed of flywheel,
v = Linear velocity of flywheel, and
σt = Tensile or hoop stress.
Fig. 22.9. Flywheel.
Consider a small element of the rim as shown shaded in Fig. 22.10. Let it subtends an angle δθ
at the centre of the flywheel.
Volume of the small element
= A.R.δθ
∴  Mass of the small element,
dm = Volume × Density
= A.R.δθ.ρ = ρ.A.R.δθ
and centrifugal force on the element,
dF = dm.ω2.R = ρ.A.R.δθ.ω2.R
= ρ.A.R2.ω2.δθ
Vertical component of dF

2ρA.R2.ω2 = 2 σt × A
∴
σt = ρ.R2.ω2 = ρ.v2                       ...( Q v = ω.R)
...(iii)
when ρ is in kg / m3 and v is in m / s, then σt will be in N / m2 or Pa.

Note : From the above expression, the mean diameter (D) of the flywheel may be obtained by using the relation,
v = π D.N / 60
2.  Tensile bending stress caused by restraint of the arms
The tensile bending stress in the rim due to the restraint of the arms is based on the assumption
that each portion of the rim between a pair of arms behaves like a beam fixed at both ends and
uniformly loaded, as shown in Fig. 22.11, such that length between fixed ends,
l =

Now total stress in the rim,

If the arms of a flywheel do not stretch at all and are placed very close together, then centrifugal
force will not set up stress in the rim. In other words, σt will be zero. On the other hand, if the arms are
stretched enough to allow free expansion of the rim due to centrifugal action, there will be no restraint
due to the arms, i.e. σb will be zero.
It has been shown by G. Lanza that the arms of a flywheel stretch about 3

flywheel with a rim whose breadth is twice its
radial thickness. The density of cast iron is 7250
kg / m3, and its working stress in tension is 6 MPa.
Assume that the rim contributes 92% of the
flywheel effect.
Solution. Given : = N = 600 r.p.m. or
ω = 2π × 600 / 60 = 62.84 rad / s ; ρ = 7250 kg / m3 ; σt = 6 MPa = 6 × 106 N/m2
Moment of inertia of the flywheel
Let
I = Moment of inertia of the flywheel.
First of all, let us find the maximum fluctuation of energy. The turning moment diagram is
shown in Fig. 22.12.
Fig. 22.12
Since the scale for the turning moment is 1 mm = 250 N-m and the scale for the crank angle is
1 mm = 3º = 60
π  rad, therefore
1 mm2 on the turning moment diagram
= 250 × 60
π  = 13.1 N-m
Let the total energy at  A = E. Therefore from Fig. 22.12, we find that
Energy at B = E + 160
Energy at C = E + 160 – 172 = E – 12
Energy at D = E – 12 + 168 = E + 156
Energy at E = E + 156 – 191 = E – 35
Energy at F = E – 35 + 197 = E + 162

792    A Textbook of Machine Design
Energy at G = E + 162 – 162 = E = Energy at A
From above, we find that the energy is maximum at F and minimum at E.
∴ Maximum energy
= E + 162
and minimum energy
= E – 35
We know that the maximum fluctuation of energy,
Δ E = Maximum energy – Minimum energy
= (E + 162) – (E – 35) = 197 mm2 = 197 × 13.1 = 2581 N-m
Since the fluctuation of speed is ± 1% of the mean speed (ω), therefore total fluctuation of
speed,
ω1 –  ω2 = 2% ω = 0.02 ω
and coefficient of fluctuation of speed,
CS =

We know that the maximum fluctuation of energy (ΔE),
2581 = I.ω2.CS = I (62.84)2 0.02 = 79 I
∴
I = 2581 / 79 = 32.7 kg-m2 Ans.
Dimensions of a flywheel rim
Let
t = Thickness of the flywheel rim in metres, and
b = Breadth of the flywheel rim in metres = 2 t
...(Given)
First of all let us find the peripheral velocity (v) and mean diameter (D) of the flywheel.
We know that tensile stress (σt ),
6 × 106 = ρ.v2 = 7250 × v2
∴
v2 = 6 × 106 / 7250 = 827.6   or  v = 28.76 m/s
We also know that peripheral velocity (v),

∴

Now let us find the mass of the flywheel rim. Since the rim contributes 92% of the flywheel
effect, therefore the energy of the flywheel rim (Erim) will be 0.92 times the total energy of the flywheel
(E). We know that maximum fluctuation of energy (ΔE),
2581 = E × 2 CS = E × 2 × 0.02 = 0.04 E
∴
E = 2581 / 0.04 = 64 525 N-m
and energy of the flywheel rim,
Erim = 0.92 E = 0.92 × 64 525 = 59 363 N-m
Let
m = Mass of the flywheel rim.
We know that energy of the flywheel rim (Erim),
59 363 = 1
2  × m × v2 = 1
2  × m (28.76)2 = 413.6 m
∴
m = 59 363 / 413.6 = 143.5 kg
We also know that mass of the flywheel rim (m),
143.5 = b × t × π D × ρ = 2 t × t × π × 0.915 × 7250 = 41 686 t2

and
b = 2 t = 2 × 60 = 120 mm Ans.
Notes: The mass of the flywheel rim may also be obtained by using the following relations. Since the rim
contributes 92% of the flywheel effect, therefore using
1.
Irim = 0.92 Iflywheel   or   m.k2 = 0.92 × 32.7 = 30 kg–m2

m (28.76)2 0.02 = 0.92 × 2581
16.55 m = 2374.5   or   m = 2374.5 / 16.55 = 143.5 kg
Example 22.6. The areas of the turning moment diagram for one revolution of a multi-cylinder
engine with reference to the mean turning moment, below and above the line, are
– 32, + 408, – 267, + 333, – 310, + 226, – 374, + 260 and – 244 mm2.
The scale for abscissa and ordinate are: 1 mm = 2.4° and 1 mm = 650 N-m respectively. The
mean speed is 300 r.p.m. with a percentage speed fluctuation of ± 1.5%. If the hoop stress in the
material of the rim is not to exceed 5.6 MPa, determine the suitable diameter and cross-section for
the flywheel, assuming that the width is equal to 4 times the thickness. The density of the material
may be taken as 7200 kg / m3. Neglect the effect of the boss and arms.

Now let us find the maximum fluctuation of energy. The turning moment diagram for one
revolution of a multi-cylinder engine is shown in Fig. 22.13.
Fig. 22.13
Since the scale of crank angle is 1 mm = 2.4º = 2.4 × 180
π  = 0.042 rad, and the scale of the
turning moment is 1 mm = 650 N-m, therefore
1 mm2 on the turning moment diagram

Let the total energy at A = E. Therefore from Fig. 22.13, we find that
Energy at B = E – 32
Energy at C = E – 32 + 408 = E + 376
Energy at D = E + 376 – 267 = E + 109
Energy at E = E + 109 + 333 = E + 442

Energy at I = E – 16 + 260 = E + 244
Energy at J = E + 244 – 244 = E = Energy at A
From above, we see that the energy is maximum at E and minimum at B.
∴
Maximum energy = E + 442

We know that maximum fluctuation of energy,
Δ E = Maximum energy – Minimum energy

Example 22.7. An otto cycle engine develops 50 kW at 150 r.p.m. with 75 explosions per
minute. The change of speed from the commencement to the end of power stroke must not exceed
0.5% of mean on either side. Design a suitable rim section having width four times the depth so that
the hoop stress does not exceed 4 MPa. Assume that the flywheel stores 16/15 times the energy stored
by the rim and that the workdone during power stroke is 1.40 times the workdone during the cycle.
Density of rim material is 7200 kg / m3.
Solution. Given : P = 50 kW = 50 × 103 W ; N = 150 r.p.m. ; n = 75 ; σt = 4 MPa = 4 × 106 N/m2 ;

Dimensions for the rim cross-section
Considering the cross-section of the rim as rectangular and assuming the width of rim equal to
twice the thickness of rim.
Let
t = Thickness of rim in metres, and
b = Width of rim in metres = 2 t.
∴  Cross-sectional area of rim,
A = b × t = 2 t × t = 2 t2
Since the punching operation takes place (i.e. energy is consumed) during 1/10 th of a revolution

flywheel.

Let

Since the hub and the spokes provide 5% of the rotational inertia of the wheel, therefore the
maximum fluctuation of energy provided by the flywheel rim will be 95%.
∴ Maximum fluctuation of energy provided by the rim,
(Δ E)rim = 0.95 × Δ E = 0.95 × 3436 = 3264 N-m
Since the flywheel is to revolve at 9 times the speed of the crankshaft and there are 25 working
strokes per minute, therefore mean speed of the flywheel,
N = 9 × 25 = 225 r.p.m.
and mean angular speed,
ω = 2 π × 225 / 60 = 23.56 rad/s

We also know that mass of the flywheel (m),
120 = A × π D  × ρ = 2 t2 × π × 1.4 × 7250 = 63 782 t2
∴
t 2 = 120 / 63 782 = 0.001 88   or   t = 0.044 m = 44 mm Ans.
and
b = 2 t = 2 × 44 = 88 mm Ans.

∴ Centrifugal stress induced in the rim,
σt = ρ.v2 = 7250 (16.5)2 = 1.97 × 106 N/m2 = 1.97 MPa
Since the centrifugal stress induced in the rim is less than the permissible value (i.e. 6 MPa),
therefore it is safe Ans.
22.8 Stresses in Flywheel Arms
The following stresses are induced in the arms of a flywheel.
1. Tensile stress due to centrifugal force acting on the rim.
2. Bending stress due to the torque transmitted from the rim to the shaft or from the shaft to the rim.
3. Shrinkage stresses due to unequal rate of cooling of casting. These stresses are difficult to
determine.

We shall now discuss the first two types of stresses as follows:
1.  Tensile stress due to the centrifugal force
Due to the centrifugal force acting on the rim, the arms will be subjected to direct tensile stress
whose magnitude is same as discussed in the previous article.
∴  Tensile stress in the arms,
σt1 = 3
4   σt = 3
4  ρ × v2
2.  Bending stress due to the torque transmitted
Due to the torque transmitted from the rim
to the shaft or from the shaft to the rim, the arms
will be subjected to bending, because they are
required to carry the full torque load. In order to
find out the maximum bending moment on the
arms, it may be assumed as a centilever beam fixed
at the hub and carrying a concentrated load at the
free end of the rim as shown in Fig. 22.16.
Let                                T  =  Maximum
torque transmitted by the shaft,
                                 R = Mean radius of the rim,
                   r = Radius of the hub,
                  n  = Number of arms, and
                                Z = Section modulus for the cross-section of arms.
We know that the load at the mean radius of the rim,
F = T

∴  Load on each arm

∴ Total tensile stress in the arms at the hub end,
σ = σt1 + σb1
Notes: 1. The total stress on the arms should not exceed the allowable permissible stress.
  2. If the flywheel is used as a belt pulley, then the arms are also subjected to bending due to net belt
tension (T1 – T2), where T1 and T2 are the tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt respectively.
Therefore the bending stress due to the belt tensions,

22.9 Design of Flywheel Arms
The cross-section of the arms is usually elliptical with major axis as twice the minor axis, as
shown in Fig. 22.17, and it is designed for the maximum bending stress.
Let
a1 = Major axis, and
b1 = Minor axis.
∴  Section modulus,
Z = 32

∴ Maximum bending stress,

R n Z  (R – r)               ...(ii)
Assuming a1 = 2 b1, the dimensions of the arms may be obtained
from equations (i) and (ii).
Notes: 1. The arms of the flywheel have a taper from the hub to the rim. The
taper is about 20 mm per metre length of the arm for the major axis and 10 mm per metre length for the minor
axis.
2. The number of arms are usually 6. Sometimes the arms may be 8, 10 or 12 for very large size flywheels.
3. The arms may be curved or straight. But straight arms are easy to cast and are lighter.
4. Since arms are subjected to reversal of stresses, therefore a minimum factor of safety 8 should be used.
In some cases like punching machines amd machines subjected to severe shock, a factor of safety 15 may be
used.
5. The smaller flywheels (less than 600 mm diameter) are not provided with arms. They are made web
type with holes in the web to facilitate handling.
22.10 Design of Shaft, Hub and Key
The diameter of shaft for flywheel is obtained from the maximum torque transmitted. We know
that the maximum torque transmitted,
Tmax = 16
π  × τ (d1)3
where
d1 = Diameter of the shaft, and
τ = Allowable shear stress for the material of the shaft.
The hub is designed as a hollow shaft, for the maximum torque transmitted. We know that the

The diameter of hub is usually taken as twice the diameter of shaft and length from 2 to 2.5
times the shaft diameter. It is generally taken equal to width of the rim.
A standard sunk key is used for the shaft and hub. The length of key is obtained by considering
the failure of key in shearing. We know that torque transmitted by shaft,
Tmax = L × w × τ ×

where
L = Length of the key,

Example 22.10. Design and draw a cast iron
flywheel used for a four stroke I.C engine developing
180 kW at 240 r.p.m. The hoop or centrifugal stress
developed in the flywheel is 5.2 MPa, the total
fluctuation of speed is to be limited to 3% of the mean
speed. The work done during the power stroke is 1/3
more than the average work done during the whole
cycle. The maximum torque on the shaft is twice the
mean torque. The density of cast iron is 7220 kg/m3.
Solution. Given: P = 180 kW = 180 × 103 W;
N = 240 r.p.m. ; σt = 5.2 MPa = 5.2 × 106 N/m2 ;
N1 – N2 = 3% N ; ρ = 7220 kg/m3
First of all, let us find the maximum fluctuation of energy (ΔE). The turning moment diagram of
a four stroke engine is shown in Fig. 22.18.

Since the workdone during the power stroke is 1/3 more than the average workdone during the
whole cycle, therefore,
Workdone during the power (or working) stroke
= 90 000 + 1
3  × 90 000 = 120 000 N-m
...(i)
The workdone during the power stroke is shown by a triangle ABC in Fig. 22.18 in which the
base AC = π radians and height BF = Tmax.

We know that the hoop stress developed in the flywheel rim (σt),
5.2 × 106 = ρ.v2 = 7220 × v2
∴
v2 = 5.2 × 106 / 7220 = 720   or    v = 26.8 m/s

Workdone per cycle

Workdone per stroke

3. Cross-sectional dimensions of the rim
Let
t = Depth or thickness of the rim in metres, and
b = Width of the rim in metres = 2 t
...(Assume)
∴ Cross-sectional area of the rim,
A = b.t = 2 t × t = 2 t2
We know that mass of the flywheel rim (m),
4995 = A × πD × ρ = 2 t2 × π × 2.04 × 7220 = 92 556 t2

t2 = 4995 / 92 556 = 0.054  or  t = 0.232 say 0.235 m = 235 mm Ans.
and
b = 2 t = 2 × 235 = 470 mm Ans.
4.  Diameter and length of hub
Let
d = Diameter of the hub,
d1 = Diameter of the shaft, and
l = Length of the hub.
Since the maximum torque on the shaft is twice the mean torque, therefore maximum torque
acting on the shaft,
Tmax = 2 × Tmean = 2 × 7161 = 14 322 N-m = 14 322 × 103 N-mm
We know that the maximum torque acting on the shaft (Tmax),
14 322 × 103 = 16
π  × τ (d1)3 = 16
π  × 40 (d1)3 = 7.855 (d1)3
...(Taking τ = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2)
∴
(d1)3 = 14 322 × 103 / 7.855 = 1823 × 103
or
d1 = 122 say 125 m Ans.
The diameter of the hub is made equal to twice the diameter of shaft and length of hub is equal
to width of the rim.
∴
d = 2 d1 = 2 × 125 = 250 mm = 0.25 m

Width of key,
w = 36 mm Ans.
and thickness of key
= 20 mm Ans.
The length of key (L) is obtained by considering the failure of key in shearing.

d  = L × 36 × 40 × 125

Let us now check the total stress in the rim which should not be greater than 15 MPa. We know

Example 22.11. A single cylinder double acting steam engine delivers 185 kW at 100 r.p.m.
The maximum fluctuation of energy per revolution is 15 per cent of the energy developed per revolution.
The speed variation is limited to 1 per cent either way from the mean. The mean diameter of the rim
is 2.4 m. Design and draw two views of the flywheel.
Solution. Given : P = 185 kW = 185 × 103 W ; N = 100 r.p.m ; Δ E = 15% E = 0.15 E ;

Example 22.12. A punching press pierces 35 holes per minute in a plate using 10 kN-m of
energy per hole during each revolution. Each piercing takes 40 per cent of the time needed to make
one revolution. The punch receives power through a gear reduction unit which in turn is fed by a
motor driven belt pulley 800 mm diameter and turning at 210 r.p.m. Find the power of the electric
motor if overall efficiency of the transmission unit is 80 per cent. Design a cast iron flywheel to be

the maximum diameter to 1.3 m.
Allowable shear stress in the shaft material = 50 MPa
Allowable tensile stress for cast iron = 4 MPa
Density of cast iron = 7200 kg / m3
Solution. Given : No. of holes = 35 per min ; Energy per hole = 10 kN-m = 10 000 N-m ;

Design of cast iron flywheel
First of all, let us find the maximum fluctuation of energy.
Since the overall efficiency of the transmission unit is 80%, therefore total energy to be supplied
during each revolution,
ET = 10 000
0.8
 = 12 500 N-m
We know that velocity of the belt,
v = π d.N = π × 0.8 × 210 = 528 m/min
∴  Net tension or pull acting on the belt
= 
60
P
v
×
 = 7292

×
 = 828.6 N
Since each piercing takes 40 per cent of the time needed to make one revolution, therefore time
required to punch a hole
= 0.4 / 35 = 0.0114 min
and the distance moved by the belt during punching a hole
= Velocity of the belt × Time required to punch a hole
= 528 × 0.0114 = 6.03 m

Flywheel     811
∴ Energy supplied by the belt during punching a hole,
EB = Net tension × Distance travelled by belt
= 828.6 × 6.03 = 4996 N-m
Thus energy to be supplied by the flywheel for punching during each revolution or maximum
fluctuation of energy,
Δ E = ET – EB = 12 500 – 4996 = 7504 N-m
1.  Mass of the flywheel
Let
m = Mass of the flywheel rim.
Since space considerations limit the maximum diameter of the flywheel as 1.3 m ; therefore let
us take the mean diameter of the flywheel,
D = 1.2 m or R = 0.6 m
We know that angular velocity
ω = 2

We also know that the maximum fluctuation of energy (Δ E),
7504 = m.R2.ω2.CS = m (0.6)2 (22)2 0.2 = 34.85 m
∴
m = 7504 / 34.85 = 215.3 kg Ans.
2. Cross-sectional dimensions of the flywheel rim
Let
t = Thickness of the flywheel rim in metres, and
b = Width of the flywheel rim in metres = 2 t
...(Assume)
∴ Cross-sectional area of the rim,
A = b × t = 2 t × t = 2 t 2
We know that mass of the flywheel rim (m),
215.3 = A × π D × ρ = 2 t2 × π × 1.2 × 7200 = 54.3 × 103 t2
∴
t 2 = 215.3 / 54.3 × 103 = 0.003 96
or
t = 0.063 say 0.065 m = 65 mm Ans.
and
b = 2 t = 2 × 65 = 130 mm Ans
3. Diameter and length of hub
Let
d = Diameter of the hub,
d1 = Diameter of the shaft, and
l = Length of the hub.
First of all, let us find the diameter of the shaft (d1). We know that the mean torque transmitted
by the shaft,
Tmean =

π

π ×

Assuming that the maximum torque transmitted by the shaft is twice the mean torque, therefore
maximum torque transmitted by the shaft,
Tmax = 2 × Tmean = 2 × 331.5 = 663 N-m = 663 × 103 N-mm
We know that maximum torque transmitted by the shaft (Tmax),
663 × 103 = 16
π  × τ (d1)3 = 16
π  × 50 (d1)3 = 9.82 (d1)3
∴
(d1)3 = 663 × 103 / 9.82 = 67.5 × 103
or
d1 = 40.7 say 45 mm Ans.

The diameter of the hub (d ) is made equal to twice the diameter of the shaft (d1) and length of
hub ( l ) is equal to the width of the rim (b).
∴
d = 2 d1 = 2 × 45 = 90 mm = 0.09 m and l = b = 130 mm Ans.
4. Cross-sectional dimensions of the elliptical cast iron arms
Let
a1 = Major axis,
b1 = Minor axis = 0.5 a1

n = Number of arms = 6

and
b1 = 0.5 a1 = 0.5 × 80 = 40 mm Ans.
5. Dimensions of key
The standard dimensions of rectangular sunk key for a shaft of diameter 45 mm are as follows:
Width of key,
w = 16 mm Ans.
and thickness of key
= 10 mm Ans.
The length of key (L) is obtained by considering the failure of key in shearing.
We know that maximum torque transmitted by the shaft (Tmax),
663 × 103 = L × w × τ × 
1
2
d  = L × 16 × 50 × 45
2   = 18 × 103 L
∴
L = 663 × 103/18 × 103 = 36.8 say 38 mm Ans.
Let us now check the total stress in the rim which should not be greater than 4 MPa.
We know that the velocity of the rim,
v =

Since it is less than 4 MPa, therefore the design is safe.
22.11 Construction of Flywheels
The flywheels of smaller size (upto 600 mm diameter) are casted in one piece. The rim and hub
are joined together by means of web as shown in Fig. 22.19 (a). The holes in the web may be made for
handling purposes.

Flywheel     813
In case the flywheel is of larger size (upto
2.5 metre diameter), the arms are made instead
of web, as shown in Fig. 22.19 (b). The number
of arms depends upon the size of flywheel and
its speed of rotation. But the flywheels above
2.5 metre diameter are usually casted in two
piece. Such a flywheel is known as split
flywheel. A split flywheel has the advantage of
relieving the shrinkage stresses in the arms due
to unequal rate of cooling of casting. A flywheel
made in two halves should be spilt at the arms
rather than between the arms, in order to obtain
better strength of the joint. The two halves of
the flywheel are connected by means of bolts
through the hub, as shown in Fig. 22.20. The
two halves are also joined at the rim by means
of cotter joint (as shown in Fig. 22.20) or shrink
links (as shown in Fig. 22.21). The width or
depth of the shrink link is taken as 1.25 to 1.35 times the thickness of link. The slot in the rim into which
the link is inserted is made slightly larger than the size of link.

Example 22.13. A split type flywheel has outside diameter of the rim 1.80 m, inside diameter
1.35 m and the width 300 mm. the two halves of the wheel are connected by four bolts through the
hub and near the rim joining the split arms and also by four shrink links on the rim. The speed is 250
r.p.m. and a turning moment of 15 kN-m is to be transmitted by the rim. Determine:
1. The diameter of the bolts at the hub and near the rim, σtb = 35 MPa.

23.1 Introduction
A spring is defined as an elastic body, whose function
is to distort when loaded and to recover its original shape
when the load is removed. The various important
applications of springs are as follows :
1.
To cushion, absorb or control energy due to either
shock or vibration as in car springs, railway
buffers, air-craft landing gears, shock absorbers
and vibration dampers.
2.
To apply forces, as in brakes, clutches and spring-
loaded valves.
3.
To control motion by maintaining contact between
two elements as in cams and followers.
4.
To measure forces, as in spring balances and
engine indicators.
5.
To store energy, as in watches, toys, etc.

1. Helical springs. The helical springs are made up of a wire coiled in the form of a helix and
is primarily intended for compressive or tensile loads. The cross-section of the wire from which the
spring is made may be circular, square or rectangular. The two forms of helical springs are compression
helical spring as shown in Fig. 23.1 (a) and tension helical spring as shown in Fig. 23.1 (b).
Fig. 23.1. Helical springs.
The helical springs are said to be closely coiled when the spring wire is coiled so close that the
plane containing each turn is nearly at right angles to the axis of the helix and the wire is subjected to
torsion. In other words, in a closely coiled helical spring, the helix angle is very small, it is usually less
than 10°. The major stresses produced in helical springs are shear stresses due to twisting. The load
applied is parallel to or along the axis of the spring.
In open coiled helical springs, the spring wire is coiled in such a way that there is a gap between
the two consecutive turns, as a result of which the helix angle is large. Since the application of open
coiled helical springs are limited, therefore our discussion shall confine to closely coiled helical
springs only.
The helical springs have the following advantages:
(a) These are easy to manufacture.
(b) These are available in wide range.
(c) These are reliable.
(d) These have constant spring rate.
(e) Their performance can be predicted more accurately.
(f) Their characteristics can be varied by changing dimensions.
2. Conical and volute springs. The conical and volute springs, as shown in Fig. 23.2, are used
in special applications where a telescoping spring or a spring with a spring rate that increases with the
load is desired. The conical spring, as shown in Fig. 23.2 (a), is wound with a uniform pitch whereas
the volute springs, as shown in Fig. 23.2 (b), are wound in the form of paraboloid with constant pitch
Fig. 23.2. Conical and volute springs.

and lead angles. The springs may be made either partially or completely telescoping. In either case,
the number of active coils gradually decreases. The decreasing number of coils results in an increasing
spring rate. This characteristic is sometimes utilised in vibration problems where springs are used to
support a body that has a varying mass.
The major stresses produced in conical and volute springs are also shear stresses due to twisting.
3. Torsion springs. These springs may be of helical or spiral type as shown in Fig. 23.3. The
helical type may be used only in applications where the load tends to wind up the spring and are used
in various electrical mechanisms. The spiral type is also used where the load tends to increase the
number of coils and when made of flat strip are used in watches and clocks.
The major stresses produced in torsion springs are tensile and compressive due to bending.

4. Laminated or leaf springs. The laminated or leaf spring (also known as flat spring or carriage
spring) consists of a number of flat plates (known as leaves) of varying lengths held together by
means of clamps and bolts, as shown in Fig. 23.4. These are mostly used in automobiles.
The major stresses produced in leaf springs are tensile and compressive stresses.

Fig. 23.5. Disc or bellevile springs.
5. Disc or bellevile springs. These springs consist of a number of conical discs held together
against slipping by a central bolt or tube as shown in Fig. 23.5. These springs are used in applications
where high spring rates and compact spring units are required.
The major stresses produced in disc or bellevile springs are tensile and compressive stresses.
6. Special purpose springs. These springs are air or liquid springs, rubber springs, ring springs
etc. The fluids (air or liquid) can behave as a compression spring. These springs are used for special
types of application only.

23.3 Material for Helical Springs
The material of the spring should have high fatigue strength, high ductility, high resilience and
it should be creep resistant. It largely depends upon the service for which they are used i.e. severe
service, average service or light service.
Severe service means rapid continuous loading where the ratio of minimum to maximum
load (or stress) is one-half or less, as in automotive valve springs.
Average service includes the same stress range as in severe service but with only intermittent
operation, as in engine governor springs and automobile suspension springs.
Light service includes springs subjected to loads that are static or very infrequently varied, as in
safety valve springs.
The springs are mostly made from oil-tempered carbon steel wires containing 0.60 to 0.70 per
cent carbon and 0.60 to 1.0 per cent manganese. Music wire is used for small springs. Non-ferrous
materials like phosphor bronze, beryllium copper, monel metal, brass etc., may be used in special
cases to increase fatigue resistance, temperature resistance and corrosion resistance.
Table 23.1 shows the values of allowable shear stress, modulus of rigidity and modulus of
elasticity for various materials used for springs.
The helical springs are either cold formed or hot formed depending upon the size of the wire.
Wires of small sizes (less than 10 mm diameter) are usually wound cold whereas larger size wires are
wound hot. The strength of the wires varies with size, smaller size wires have greater strength and less
ductility, due to the greater degree of cold working.

23.5 Terms used in Compression Springs
The following terms used in connection with compression springs are important from the subject
point of view.
1. Solid length. When the compression spring is compressed until the coils come in contact
with each other, then the spring is said to be solid. The solid length of a spring is the product of total
number of coils and the diameter of the wire. Mathematically,
Solid length of the spring,
LS = n'.d
where
n' = Total number of coils, and
d = Diameter of the wire.
2. Free length. The free length of a compression spring, as shown in Fig. 23.6, is the length of
the spring in the free or unloaded condition. It is equal to the solid length plus the maximum deflection
or compression of the spring and the clearance between the adjacent coils (when fully compressed).

Fig. 23.6. Compression spring nomenclature.
Free length of the spring,
LF = Solid length + Maximum compression + *Clearance between
adjacent coils (or clash allowance)
= n'.d + δmax + 0.15 δmax
The following relation may also be used to find the free length of the spring, i.e.
LF = n'.d + δmax + (n' – 1) × 1 mm
In this expression, the clearance between the two adjacent coils is taken as 1 mm.
3. Spring index. The spring index is defined as the ratio of the mean diameter of the coil to the
diameter of the wire. Mathematically,
Spring index,
C = D / d
where
D = Mean diameter of the coil, and
d = Diameter of the wire.
4. Spring rate. The spring rate (or stiffness or spring constant) is defined as the load required
per unit deflection of the spring. Mathematically,
Spring rate,
k = W / δ
where
W = Load, and
δ = Deflection of the spring.
*
In actual practice, the compression springs are seldom designed to close up under the maximum working
load and for this purpose a clearance (or clash allowance) is provided between the adjacent coils to prevent
closing of the coils during service. It may be taken as 15 per cent of the maximum deflection.

5. Pitch. The pitch of the coil is defined as the axial distance between adjacent coils in
uncompressed state. Mathematically,
Pitch of the coil,
p = Free length
– 1
n′
The pitch of the coil may also be obtained by using the following relation, i.e.
Pitch of the coil,
p =

S

L
L
d
n
+
′
where
LF = Free length of the spring,
LS = Solid length of the spring,
n' = Total number of coils, and
d = Diameter of the wire.
In choosing the pitch of the coils, the following points should be noted :
(a) The pitch of the coils should be such that if the spring is accidently or carelessly compressed,
the stress does not increase the yield point stress in torsion.
(b) The spring should not close up before the maximum service load is reached.
Note : In designing a tension spring (See Example 23.8), the minimum gap between two coils when the spring
is in the free state is taken as 1 mm. Thus the free length of the spring,
LF = n.d + (n – 1)
and pitch of the coil,
p =
F
– 1

n
23.6 End Connections for Compression Helical Springs
The end connections for compression helical springs are suitably formed in order to apply the
load. Various forms of end connections are shown in Fig. 23.7.
Fig 23.7. End connections for compression helical spring.
In all springs, the end coils produce an eccentric application of the load, increasing the stress on
one side of the spring. Under certain conditions, especially where the number of coils is small, this
effect must be taken into account. The nearest approach to an axial load is secured by squared and
ground ends, where the end turns are squared and then ground perpendicular to the helix axis. It may
be noted that part of the coil which is in contact with the seat does not contribute to spring action and
hence are termed as inactive coils. The turns which impart spring action are known as active turns.
As the load increases, the number of inactive coils also increases due to seating of the end coils and
the amount of increase varies from 0.5 to 1 turn at the usual working loads. The following table shows
the total number of turns, solid length and free length for different types of end connections.

23.7 End Connections for Tension Helical
Springs
The tensile springs are provided with hooks or loops
as shown in Fig. 23.8. These loops may be made by turning
whole coil or half of the coil. In a tension spring, large
stress concentration is produced at the loop or other
attaching device of tension spring.
The main disadvantage of tension spring is the failure
of the spring when the wire breaks. A compression spring
used for carrying a tensile load is shown in Fig. 23.9.

Contents
Top
828    A Textbook of Machine Design
Note : The total number of turns of a tension helical spring must be equal to the number of turns (n) between the
points where the loops start plus the equivalent turns for the loops. It has been found experimentally that half
turn should be added for each loop. Thus for a spring having loops on both ends, the total number of active
turns,
n' = n + 1
23.8 Stresses in Helical Springs of Circular Wire
Consider a helical compression spring made of circular wire and subjected to an axial load W, as
shown in Fig. 23.10 (a).
Let
D = Mean diameter of the spring coil,
d = Diameter of the spring wire,
n = Number of active coils,
G = Modulus of rigidity for the spring material,
W = Axial load on the spring,
τ = Maximum shear stress induced in the wire,
C = Spring index = D/d,
p = Pitch of the coils, and
δ = Deflection of the spring, as a result of an axial load W.

Now consider a part of the compression spring as shown in Fig. 23.10 (b). The load W tends to
rotate the wire due to the twisting moment ( T ) set up in the wire. Thus torsional shear stress is
induced in the wire.
A little consideration will show that part of the spring, as shown in Fig. 23.10 (b), is in equilibrium
under the action of two forces W and the twisting moment T. We know that the twisting moment,

appreciable for springs of small spring index C. Also we have neglected the effect of wire curvature
in equation (iii). It may be noted that when the springs are subjected to static loads, the effect of wire
curvature may be neglected, because yielding of the material will relieve the stresses.
In order to consider the effects of both direct shear as well as curvature of the wire, a Wahl’s
stress factor (K) introduced by A.M. Wahl may be used. The resultant diagram of torsional shear,
direct shear and curvature shear stress is shown in Fig. 23.11 (d).

We see from Fig. 23.12 that Wahl’s stress factor increases very rapidly as the spring index

Note: The Wahl’s stress factor (K) may be considered as composed of two sub-factors, KS and KC, such that
K = KS × KC
where
KS = Stress factor due to shear, and
KC = Stress concentration factor due to curvature.

23.10 Eccentric Loading of Springs
Sometimes, the load on the springs does not coincide with the axis of the spring, i.e. the spring
is subjected to an eccentric load. In such cases, not only the safe load for the spring reduces, the
stiffness of the spring is also affected. The eccentric load on the spring increases the stress on one side
of the spring and decreases on the other side. When the load is offset by a distance e from the spring
axis, then the safe load on the spring may be obtained by multiplying the axial load by the factor

23.11 Buckling of Compression Springs
It has been found experimentally that when the free length of the spring (LF) is more than four
times the mean or pitch diameter (D), then the spring behaves like a column and may fail by buckling
at a comparatively low load as shown in Fig. 23.13. The critical axial load (Wcr) that causes buckling
may be calculated by using the following relation, i.e.
Wcr = k × KB × LF
where
k = Spring rate or stiffness of the spring = W/δ,
LF = Free length of the spring, and
KB = Buckling factor depending upon the ratio LF / D.

It may be noted that a hinged end spring is one which is supported on pivots at both ends as in
case of springs having plain ends where as a built-in end spring is one in which a squared and ground
end spring is compressed between two rigid and parallel flat plates.
It order to avoid the buckling of spring, it is either mounted on a central rod or located on a tube.
When the spring is located on a tube, the clearance between the tube walls and the spring should be
kept as small as possible, but it must be sufficient to allow for increase in spring diameter during
compression.
In railway coaches strongs springs are used for suspension.

23.12 Surge in Springs
When one end of a helical spring is resting on a rigid support and the other end is loaded
suddenly, then all the coils of the spring will not suddenly deflect equally, because some time is
required for the propagation of stress along the spring wire. A little consideration will show that in the
beginning, the end coils of the spring in contact with the applied load takes up whole of the deflection
and then it transmits a large part of its deflection to the adjacent coils. In this way, a wave of compression
propagates through the coils to the supported end from where it is reflected back to the deflected end.
This wave of compression travels along the spring indefinitely. If the applied load is of fluctuating
type as in the case of valve spring in internal combustion engines and if the time interval between the
load applications is equal to the time required for the wave to travel from one end to the other end,
then resonance will occur. This results in very large deflections of the coils and correspondingly very
high stresses. Under these conditions, it is just possible that the spring may fail. This phenomenon is
called surge.
It has been found that the natural frequency of spring should be atleast twenty times the frequency
of application of a periodic load in order to avoid resonance with all harmonic frequencies upto
twentieth order. The natural frequency for springs clamped between two plates is given by

where
d = Diameter of the wire,
D = Mean diameter of the spring,
n = Number of active turns,
G = Modulus of rigidity,
g = Acceleration due to gravity, and
ρ = Density of the material of the spring.
The surge in springs may be eliminated by using the following methods :
1. By using friction dampers on the centre coils so that the wave propagation dies out.
2. By using springs of high natural frequency.
3. By using springs having pitch of the coils near the ends different than at the centre to have
different natural frequencies.
Example 23.1. A compression coil spring made of an alloy steel is having the following
specifications :
Mean diameter of coil = 50 mm ; Wire diameter = 5 mm ; Number of active coils = 20.
If this spring is subjected to an axial load of 500 N ; calculate the maximum shear stress
(neglect the curvature effect) to which the spring material is subjected.

Design of spring
Let
D = Mean diameter of the spring coil,
d = Diameter of the spring wire, and
C = Spring index = D/d.
Since the spring is to be enclosed in a casing of 25 mm diameter, therefore the outer diameter of
the spring coil (Do = D + d ) should be less than 25 mm.

D = C.d = 4.84 × 4 = 19.36 mm Ans.
We know that outer diameter of the spring coil,
Do = D + d = 19.36 + 4 = 23.36 mm Ans.
Since the value of Do = 23.36 mm is less than the casing diameter of 25 mm, therefore the
assumed dimension, d = 4 mm is correct.

Length of the spring when the valve is closed

Example 23.8. Design a helical spring for a spring loaded safety valve (Ramsbottom safety
valve) for the following conditions :
Diameter of valve seat = 65 mm ; Operating pressure = 0.7
N/mm2; Maximum pressure when the valve blows off freely = 0.75
N/mm2; Maximum lift of the valve when the pressure rises from 0.7 to
0.75 N/mm2 = 3.5 mm ; Maximum allowable stress = 550 MPa ;
Modulus of rigidity = 84 kN/mm2; Spring index = 6.
Draw a neat sketch of the free spring showing the main

Example 23.10. In a spring loaded governor as shown in Fig. 23.16, the balls are attached
to the vertical arms of the bell crank lever, the horizontal arms of which lift the sleeve against the
pressure exerted by a spring. The mass of each ball is 2.97 kg and the lengths of the vertical and
horizontal arms of the bell crank lever are 150 mm and 112.5 mm respectively. The extreme radii
of rotation of the balls are 100 mm and 150 mm and the governor sleeve begins to lift at 240 r.p.m.
and reaches the highest position with a 7.5 percent increase of speed when effects of friction are
neglected. Design a suitable close coiled round section spring for the governor.

Example 23.11. A single plate clutch is to be designed for a vehicle. Both sides of the plate are
to be effective. The clutch transmits 30 kW at a speed of 3000 r.p.m. and should cater for an over load

surface speed at the mean radius should be limited to 2300 m / min. The outside diameter of the
surfaces may be assumed as 1.3 times the inside diameter and the coefficient of friction for the
surfaces may be taken as 0.3. If the axial thrust is to be provided by six springs of about 25 mm mean

Let r1 and r2 be the outside and inside radii of the friction surfaces. Since maximum intensity of
pressure is at the inner radius, therefore for uniform wear,
*p × r2 = C (a constant) or C = 0.085 r2
We know that the axial thrust transmitted,

Example 23.12. Find the maximum shear stress and deflection induced in a helical spring of
the following specifications, if it has to absorb 1000 N-m of energy.
Mean diameter of spring = 100 mm ; Diameter of steel wire, used for making the spring =

springs are set in parallel to absorb the shock caused by the falling of the cage in case of a failure.

23.14 Stress and Deflection in Helical Springs of Non-circular Wire
The helical springs may be made of non-circular wire such as rectangular or square wire, in
order to provide greater resilience in a given space. However these springs have the following main
disadvantages :
1. The quality of material used for springs is not so good.
2. The shape of the wire does not remain square or rectangular while
forming helix, resulting in trapezoidal cross-sections. It reduces the
energy absorbing capacity of the spring.
3. The stress distribution is not as favourable as for circular wires.
But this effect is negligible where loading is of static nature.
For springs made of rectangular wire, as shown in Fig. 23.18, the maxi-
mum shear stress is given by

23.15 Helical Springs Subjected to Fatigue Loading
The helical springs subjected to fatigue loading are designed by using the *Soderberg line
method. The spring materials are usually tested for torsional endurance strength under a repeated
stress that varies from zero to a maximum. Since the springs are ordinarily loaded in one direction
only (the load in springs is never reversed in nature), therefore a modified Soderberg diagram is used
for springs, as shown in Fig. 23.19.
The endurance limit for reversed loading is shown at point A where the mean shear stress is
equal to τe / 2 and the variable shear stress is also equal to τe / 2. A line drawn from A to B (the yield
point in shear, τy) gives the Soderberg’s failure stress line. If a suitable factor of safety (F.S.) is
applied to the yield strength (τy), a safe stress line CD may be drawn parallel to the line AB, as shown
in Fig. 23.19. Consider a design point P on the line CD. Now the value of factor of safety may be
obtained as discussed below :
*

We know that free length of the spring,

23.16 Springs in Series
Consider two springs connected in series as shown in Fig. 23.20.
Let
W = Load carried by the springs,
δ1 = Deflection of spring 1,
δ2 = Deflection of spring 2,
k1 = Stiffness of spring 1 = W / δ1, and
k2 = Stiffness of spring 2 = W / δ2
A little consideration will show that when the springs are connected in series,
then the total deflection produced by the springs is equal to the sum of the deflections
of the individual springs.
∴ Total deflection of the springs,
δ = δ1 + δ2

Let
W = Load carried by the springs,
W1 = Load shared by spring 1,
W2 = Load shared by spring 2,
k1 = Stiffness of spring 1, and
k2 = Stiffness of spring 2.
A little consideration will show that when the springs are connected in parallel, then the total
deflection produced by the springs is same as the deflection of the individual springs.
We know that
W = W1 + W2
or
δ.k = δ.k1 + δ.k2
∴
k = k1 + k2
where
k = Combined stiffness of the springs, and

23.18 Concentric or Composite Springs
A concentric or composite spring is used for one of the following purposes :
1. To obtain greater spring force
within a given space.
2. To insure the operation of a
mechanism in the event of failure of one of
the springs.
The concentric springs for the above
two purposes may have two or more springs
and have the same free lengths as shown in
Fig. 23.22 (a) and are compressed equally.
Such springs are used in automobile
clutches, valve springs in aircraft, heavy duty
diesel engines and rail-road car suspension
systems.
Sometimes concentric springs are used
to obtain a spring force which does not
increase in a direct relation to the deflection
but increases faster. Such springs are made
of different lengths as shown in Fig. 23.22
(b). The shorter spring begins to act only
after the longer spring is compressed to a
certain amount. These springs are used in
governors of variable speed engines to take
care of the variable centrifugal force.

The adjacent coils of the concentric spring are wound in opposite directions to eliminate any
tendency to bind.
If the same material is used, the concentric springs are designed for the same stress. In order to
get the same stress factor (K), it is desirable to have the same spring index (C ).

Consider a concentric spring as shown in Fig. 23.22 (a).

Example 23.19. A concentric spring for an aircraft engine valve is to exert a maximum force of
5000 N under an axial deflection of 40 mm. Both the springs have same free length, same solid
length and are subjected to equal maximum shear stress of 850 MPa. If the spring index for both the
springs is 6, find (a) the load shared by each spring, (b) the main dimensions of both the springs, and
(c) the number of active coils in each spring.
Assume G = 80 kN/mm2 and diametral clearance to be equal to the difference between the wire
diameters.
Solution. Given : W = 5000 N ; δ = 40 mm ; τ1 = τ2 = 850 MPa = 850 N/mm2 ; C = 6 ;
G = 80 kN/mm2 = 80 × 103 N/mm2
The concentric spring is shown in Fig. 23.22 (a).
(a)  Load shared by each spring
Let
W1 and W2 = Load shared by outer and inner spring respectively,
d1 and d2 = Diameter of spring wires for outer and inner springs respectively, and
D1 and D2 = Mean diameter of the outer and inner springs respectively.
*

Since the diametral clearance is equal to the difference between the wire diameters, therefore
(D1 – D2) –  (d1 + d2) = d1 – d2
or
D1 – D2 = 2 d1
We know that
D1 = C.d1, and D2 = C.d2

∴ Solid length of the outer spring,
LS1 = n1' . d1 = 8 × 10 = 80 mm
Let n2' be the total number of turns of the inner spring. Since both the springs have the same
solid length, therefore,
n2'.d2 = n1'.d1

Example 23.20. A composite spring has two closed coil helical springs as shown in Fig. 23.22 (b).
The outer spring is 15 mm larger than the inner spring. The outer spring has 10 coils of mean
diameter 40 mm and wire diameter 5mm. The inner spring has 8 coils of mean diameter 30 mm and
wire diameter 4 mm. When the spring is subjected to an axial load of 400 N, find 1. compression of
each spring, 2. load shared by each spring, and 3. shear stress induced in each spring. The modulus
of rigidity may be taken as 84 kN/mm2.
Solution. Given : δ1 = l1 – l2 = 15 mm ; n1 = 10 ; D1 = 40 mm ; d1 = 5 mm ; n2 = 8 ;
D2 = 30 mm ; d2 = 4 mm ; W = 400 N ; G = 84 kN/mm2 = 84 × 103 N/mm2
1. Compression of each spring
Since the outer spring is 15 mm larger than the inner spring, therefore the inner spring will not
take any load till the outer spring is compressed by 15 mm. After this, both the springs are compressed
together. Let P1 be the load on the outer spring to compress it by 15 mm.
We know that compression of the spring (δ),

Now the remaining load i.e. W – P1 = 400 – 154 = 246 N is taken together by both the springs.
Let δ2 = Further compression of the outer spring or the total compression of the inner spring.
Since for compressing the outer spring by 15 mm, the load required is 154 N, therefore the
additional load required by the outer spring to compress it by δ2 mm is given by

10.27 δ2 + 12.5 δ2 = 246   or   δ2 = 246 / 22.77 = 10.8 mm Ans.
∴ Total compression of the outer spring

2. Load shared by each spring
We know that the load shared by the outer spring,
W1 = P1 + P2 = 154 + 10.27 δ2 = 154 + 10.27 × 10.8 = 265 N Ans.
and load shared by the inner spring,
W2 = 12.5 δ2 = 12.5 × 10.8 = 135 N Ans.

23.19 Helical Torsion Springs
The helical torsion springs as shown in Fig. 23.23, may be made from round, rectangular or
square wire. These are wound in a similar manner as helical compression or tension springs but the
ends are shaped to transmit torque. The primary
stress in helical torsion springs is bending stress
whereas in compression or tension springs, the
stresses are torsional shear stresses. The helical
torsion springs are widely used for transmitting
small torques as in door hinges, brush holders in
electric motors, automobile starters etc.
A little consideration will show that the
radius of curvature of the coils changes when the
twisting moment is applied to the spring. Thus,
the wire is under pure bending. According to A.M.
Wahl, the bending stress in a helical torsion spring
made of round wire is

Note : Since the diameter of the spring D reduces as the coils wind up under the applied load, therefore a
clearance must be provided when the spring wire is to be wound round a mandrel. A small clearance must also
be provided between the adjacent coils in order to prevent sliding friction.
Example 23.21. A helical torsion spring of mean diameter 60 mm is made of a round wire of
6 mm diameter. If a torque of 6 N-m is applied on the spring, find the bending stress induced and the
angular deflection of the spring in degrees. The spring index is 10 and modulus of elasticity for the
spring material is 200 kN/mm2. The number of effective turns may be taken as 5.5.
Solution. Given : D = 60 mm ; d = 6 mm ; M = 6 N-m = 6000 N-mm ; C = 10 ; E = 200 kN/mm2
= 200 × 103 N/mm2 ; n = 5.5

23.20 Flat Spiral Spring
A flat spring is a long thin strip of elastic material wound like a spiral as shown in Fig. 23.24.
These springs are frequently used in watches and gramophones etc.
When the outer or inner end of this type of spring is wound
up in such a way that there is a tendency in the increase of number
of spirals of the spring, the strain energy is stored into its spirals.
This energy is utilised in any useful way while the spirals open out
slowly. Usually the inner end of spring is clamped to an arbor while
the outer end may be pinned or clamped. Since the radius of
curvature of every spiral decreases when the spring is wound up,
therefore the material of the spring is in a state of pure bending.
Let
W = Force applied at the outer end A of the spring,
y =  Distance of centre of gravity of the spring from A,
l =  Length of strip forming the spring,

23.21 Leaf Springs
Leaf springs (also known as flat springs) are made out of flat plates. The advantage of leaf
spring over helical spring is that the ends of the spring may be guided along a definite path as it
deflects to act as a structural member in addition to energy absorbing device. Thus the leaf springs
may carry lateral loads, brake torque, driving torque etc., in addition to shocks.
Consider a single plate fixed at one end and loaded at the other end as shown in Fig. 23.25. This
plate may be used as a flat spring.
Let
t = Thickness of plate,
b = Width of plate, and
L = Length of plate or distance
of the load W from the
cantilever end.
We know that the maximum bending moment at the
cantilever end A,

It may be noted that due to bending moment, top fibres will be in tension and the bottom fibres
are in compression, but the shear stress is zero at the extreme fibres and maximum at the centre, as
shown in Fig. 23.26. Hence for analysis, both stresses need not to be taken into account simultaneously.
We shall consider the bending stress only.

From above we see that a spring such as automobile spring (semi-elliptical spring) with length
2L and loaded in the centre by a load 2W, may be treated as a double cantilever.

The above relations give the stress and deflection of a leaf spring of uniform cross-section. The
stress at such a spring is maximum at the support.
If a triangular plate is used as shown in Fig. 23.29 (a), the stress will be uniform throughout. If
this triangular plate is cut into strips of uniform width and placed one below the other, as shown in
Fig. 23.29 (b) to form a graduated or laminated leaf spring, then

When bending stress alone is considered, the graduated leaves may have zero width at the
loaded end. But sufficient metal must be provided to support the shear. Therefore, it becomes necessary
to have one or more leaves of uniform cross-section extending clear to the end. We see from equations
(iv) and (vi) that for the same deflection, the stress in the uniform cross-section leaves (i.e. full length
leaves) is 50% greater than in the graduated leaves, assuming that each spring element deflects according
to its own elastic curve. If the suffixes F and G are used to indicate the full length (or uniform cross-
section) and graduated leaves, then

23.22 Construction of Leaf Spring
A leaf spring commonly used in automobiles is of semi-elliptical form as shown in Fig. 23.30.
Contents
Top
870    A Textbook of Machine Design
It is built up of a number of plates (known as leaves). The leaves are usually given an initial curvature
or cambered so that they will tend to straighten under the load. The leaves are held together by means
of a band shrunk around them at the centre or by a bolt passing through the centre. Since the band
exerts a stiffening and strengthening effect, therefore the effective length of the spring for bending
will be overall length of the spring minus width of band. In case of a centre bolt, two-third distance
between centres of U-bolt should be subtracted from the overall length of the spring in order to find
effective length. The spring is clamped to the axle housing by means of U-bolts.

Fig. 23.30. Semi-elliptical leaf spring.
The longest leaf known as main leaf or master leaf
has its ends formed in the shape of an eye through which
the bolts are passed to secure the spring to its supports.
Usually the eyes, through which the spring is attached to
the hanger or shackle, are provided with bushings of some
antifriction material such as bronze or rubber. The other
leaves of the spring are known as graduated leaves. In
order to prevent digging in the adjacent leaves, the ends of
the graduated leaves are trimmed in various forms as shown
in Fig. 23.30. Since the master leaf has to with stand vertical
bending loads as well as loads due to sideways of the
vehicle and twisting, therefore due to the presence of
stresses caused by these loads, it is usual to provide two
full length leaves and the rest graduated leaves as shown
in Fig. 23.30.
Rebound clips are located at intermediate positions
in the length of the spring, so that the graduated leaves
also share the stresses induced in the full length leaves
when the spring rebounds.
23.23 Equalised Stress in Spring Leaves
(Nipping)
We have already discussed that the stress in the full
length leaves is 50% greater than the stress in the graduated
Leaf spring fatigue testing system.
Contents
Top
Springs      871
leaves. In order to utilise the material to the best advantage, all the leaves should be equally stressed.
This condition may be obtained in the following two ways :
1. By making the full length leaves of smaller thickness than the graduated leaves. In this way,
the full length leaves will induce smaller bending stress due to small distance from the neutral axis to
the edge of the leaf.
2.  By giving a greater radius of curvature to the full length leaves than graduated leaves, as shown
in Fig. 23.31, before the leaves are assembled to form a spring. By doing so, a gap or clearance will be
left between the leaves. This initial gap, as shown by C in Fig. 23.31, is called nip. When the central bolt,
holding the various leaves together, is tightened, the full length leaf will bend back as shown dotted in
Fig. 23.31 and have an initial stress in a direction opposite to that of the normal load. The graduated
leaves will have an initial stress in the same direction as that of the normal load. When the load is
gradually applied to the spring, the full length leaf is first relieved of this initial stress and then stressed
in opposite direction. Consequently, the full length leaf will be stressed less than the graduated leaf. The
initial gap between the leaves may be adjusted so that under maximum load condition the stress in all the
leaves is equal, or if desired, the full length leaves may have the lower stress. This is desirable in
automobile springs in which full length leaves are designed for lower stress because the full length
leaves carry additional loads caused by the swaying of the car, twisting and in some cases due to driving
the car through the rear springs. Let us now find the value of initial gap or nip C.
Consider that under maximum load conditions, the stress in all the leaves is equal. Then at
maximum load, the total deflection of the graduated leaves will exceed the deflection of the full
length leaves by an amount equal to the initial gap C. In other words,
δG = δF + C

Notes : 1. The final stress in the leaves is also equal to the stress in graduated leaves due to the applied load plus
the initial stress.
2. The deflection in the spring due to the applied load is same as without initial stress.
23.24 Length of Leaf Spring Leaves
The length of the leaf spring leaves may be obtained as discussed below :
Let
2L1 = Length of span or overall length of the spring,
l = Width of band or distance between centres of U-bolts. It is the
ineffective length of the spring,
nF = Number of full length leaves,
nG = Number of graduated leaves, and
n = Total number of leaves = nF + nG.
We have already discussed that the effective length of the spring,
2L = 2L1 – l
...(When band is used)
=
1
2
2
– 3
L
l
... (When U-bolts are used)
It may be noted that when there is only one full length leaf (i.e. master leaf only), then the
number of leaves to be cut will be n and when there are two full length leaves (including one master
leaf), then the number of leaves to be cut will be (n – 1). If a leaf spring has two full length leaves, then
the length of leaves is obtained as follows :

Length of smallest leaf

×
 + Ineffective length
Similarly, length of (n – 1)th leaf
= Effective length

n
 × (n – 1) + Ineffective length
The nth leaf will be the master leaf and it is of full length. Since the master leaf has eyes on both
sides, therefore
Length of master leaf
= 2 L1 + π (d + t) × 2
where
d = Inside diameter of eye, and
t = Thickness of master leaf.
The approximate relation between the radius of curvature (R) and the camber (y) of the spring
is given by
R =

The exact relation is given by

Notes : 1. For springs of width below 65 mm, one rivet of 6, 8 or 10 mm may be used. For springs of width
above 65 mm, two rivets of 6 or 8 mm or one rivet of 10 mm may be used.

23.26 Materials for Leaf Springs
The material used for leaf springs is usually a plain carbon steel having 0.90 to 1.0% carbon.
The leaves are heat treated after the forming process. The heat treatment of spring steel produces
greater strength and therefore greater load capacity, greater range of deflection and better fatigue
properties.
According to Indian standards, the recommended materials are :
1.
For automobiles : 50 Cr 1, 50 Cr 1 V 23, and 55 Si 2 Mn 90 all used in hardened and
tempered state.
2.
For rail road springs : C 55 (water-hardened), C 75 (oil-hardened), 40 Si 2 Mn 90 (water-
hardened) and 55 Si 2 Mn 90 (oil-hardened).
3.
The physical properties of some of these materials are given in the following table. All
values are for oil quenched condition and for single heat only.

the manufacture of volute, helical and laminated springs for automotive suspension’ may be referred.
Example 23.23. Design a leaf spring for the following specifications :
Total load = 140 kN ; Number of springs supporting the load = 4 ; Maximum number of leaves
= 10; Span of the spring = 1000 mm ; Permissible deflection = 80 mm.
Take Young’s modulus, E = 200 kN/mm2 and allowable stress in spring material as 600 MPa.

Springs      875
Solution. Given : Total load = 140 kN ; No. of springs = 4; n = 10 ; 2L = 1000 mm or
L = 500 mm ; δ = 80 mm ; E = 200 kN/mm2 = 200 × 103 N/mm2 ; σ = 600 MPa = 600 N/mm2

Example 23.24. A truck spring has 12 number of leaves, two of which are full length leaves.
The spring supports are 1.05 m apart and the central band is 85 mm wide. The central load is to be
5.4 kN with a permissible stress of 280 MPa. Determine the thickness and width of the steel spring
leaves. The ratio of the total depth to the width of the spring is 3. Also determine the deflection of the
spring.
Solution. Given : n = 12 ; nF = 2 ; 2L1 = 1.05 m = 1050 mm ; l = 85 mm ; 2W = 5.4 kN
= 5400 N or W = 2700 N ; σF = 280 MPa = 280 N/mm2
Thickness and width of the spring leaves
Let
t = Thickness of the leaves, and
b = Width of the leaves.
Since it is given that the ratio of the total depth of the spring (n × t) and width of the spring (b)
is 3, therefore
n

b

We know that the effective length of the spring,
2L = 2L1 – l = 1050 – 85 = 965 mm
∴
L = 965 / 2 = 482.5 mm

Example 23.25. A locomotive semi-elliptical laminated spring has an overall length of 1 m
and sustains a load of 70 kN at its centre. The spring has 3 full length leaves and 15 graduated leaves
with a central band of 100 mm width. All the leaves are to be stressed to 400 MPa, when fully loaded.
The ratio of the total spring depth to that of width is 2. E = 210 kN/mm2. Determine :
1. The thickness and width of the leaves.
2. The initial gap that should be provided between the full length and graduated leaves before
the band load is applied.
3. The load exerted on the band after the spring is assembled.
Solution. Given : 2L1 = 1 m = 1000 mm ; 2W = 70 kN or W = 35 kN = 35 × 103 N ;
nF = 3 ; nG = 15 ; l = 100 mm ; σ = 400 MPa = 400 N/mm2 ; E = 210 kN/mm2 = 210 × 103 N/mm2
1. Thickness and width of leaves
Let
t = Thickness of leaves, and
b = Width of leaves.
We know that the total number of leaves,
n = nF + nG = 3 + 15 = 18
Since it is given that ratio of the total spring depth (n × t) and width of leaves is 2, therefore
n

b

We know that the effective length of the leaves,
2L = 2L1 – l = 1000 – 100 = 900 mm  or   L = 900 / 2 = 450 mm
Since all the leaves are equally stressed, therefore final stress (σ),

Example 23.26. A semi-elliptical laminated vehicle spring to carry a load of 6000 N is to
consist of seven leaves 65 mm wide, two of the leaves extending the full length of the spring. The
spring is to be 1.1 m in length and attached to the axle by two U-bolts 80 mm apart. The bolts hold
the central portion of the spring so rigidly that they may be considered equivalent to a band having
a width equal to the distance between the bolts. Assume a design stress for spring material as 350
MPa. Determine :
1. Thickness of leaves, 2. Deflection of spring, 3. Diameter of eye, 4. Length of leaves, and 5.
Radius to which leaves should be initially bent.
Sketch the semi-elliptical leaf-spring arrangement.
The standard thickness of leaves are : 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 9, 10, 11 etc. in mm.
Solution. Given : 2W = 6000 N or W = 3000 N ; n = 7 ; b = 65 mm ; nF = 2 ; 2L1 = 1.1 m
= 1100 mm or L1 = 550 mm ; l = 80 mm ; σ = 350 MPa = 350 N/mm2
1. Thickness of leaves
Let
t = Thickness of leaves.
We know that the effective length of the spring,
2L = 2L1 – l = 1100 – 80 = 1020 mm
∴
L = 1020 / 2 = 510 mm
and number of graduated leaves,
nG = n – nF = 7 – 2 = 5

3. Diameter of eye
The inner diameter of eye is obtained by considering the pin in the eye in bearing, because the
inner diameter of the eye is equal to the diameter of the pin.
Let
d = Inner diameter of the eye or diameter of the pin,
l1 = Length of the pin which is equal to the width of the eye or leaf
(i.e. b) = 65 mm
...(Given)
pb = Bearing pressure on the pin which may be taken as 8 N/mm2.
Contents
Top
878    A Textbook of Machine Design
We know that the load on pin (W),
3000 = d × l1 × pb
= d × 65 × 8 = 520 d
∴
d = 3000 / 520
= 5.77 say 6 mm
Let us now consider the bending of the pin. Since there
is a clearance of about 2 mm between the shackle (or plate)
and eye as shown in Fig. 23.33, therefore length of the pin
under bending,
l2 = l1 + 2 × 2 = 65 + 4 = 69 mm

24.1 Introduction
A clutch is a machine member used to connect a
driving shaft to a driven shaft so that the driven shaft may
be started or stopped at will, without stopping the driving
shaft. The use of a clutch is mostly found in automobiles. A
little consideration will show that in order to change gears
or to stop the vehicle, it is required that the driven shaft
should stop, but the engine should continue to run. It is,
therefore, necessary that the driven shaft should be
disengaged from the driving shaft. The engagement and
disengagement of the shafts is obtained by means of a clutch
which is operated by a lever.
24.2 Types of Clutches
Following are the two main types of clutches
commonly used in engineering practice :
1.  Positive clutches, and  2. Friction clutches.
Contents
Top
886    A Textbook of Machine Design
We shall now discuss these clutches in the following pages.
24.3 Positive Clutches
The positive clutches are used when a positive drive is required. The simplest type of a positive
clutch is a jaw or claw clutch. The jaw clutch permits one shaft to drive another through a direct
contact of interlocking jaws. It consists of two halves, one of which is permanently fastened to the
Fig. 24.1. Jaw clutches.
 driving shaft by a sunk key. The other half of the clutch is movable and it is free to slide axially on the
driven shaft, but it is prevented from turning relatively to its shaft by means of feather key. The jaws
of the clutch may be of square type as shown in Fig. 24.1 (a) or of spiral type as shown in Fig. 24.1 (b).
A square jaw type is used where engagement and disengagement in motion and under load is
not necessary. This type of clutch will transmit power in either direction of rotation. The spiral jaws
may be left-hand or right-hand, because power transmitted by them is in one direction only. This type
of clutch is occasionally used where the clutch must be engaged and disengaged while in motion. The
use of jaw clutches are frequently applied to sprocket wheels, gears and pulleys. In such a case, the
non-sliding part is made integral with the hub.
24.4 Friction Clutches
A friction clutch has its principal application in the transmission of power of shafts and
machines which must be started and stopped frequently. Its application is also found in cases in which
power is to be delivered to machines partially or fully loaded. The force of friction is used to start the
driven shaft from rest and gradually brings it up to the proper speed without excessive slipping of the
friction surfaces. In automobiles, friction clutch is used to connect the engine to the drive shaft. In
operating such a clutch, care should be taken so that the friction surfaces engage easily and gradually
bring the driven shaft up to proper speed. The proper alignment of the bearing must be maintained
and it should be located as close to the clutch as possible. It may be noted that :
1.
The contact surfaces should develop a frictional force that may pick up and hold the load
with reasonably low pressure between the contact surfaces.
2.
The heat of friction should be rapidly *dissipated and tendency to grab should be at a
minimum.
3.
The surfaces should be backed by a material stiff enough to ensure a reasonably uniform
distribution of pressure.
24.5 Material for Friction Surfaces
The material used for lining of friction surfaces of a clutch should have the following
characteristics :
*
During operation of a clutch, most of the work done against frictional forces opposing the motion is
liberated as heat at the interface. It has been found that at the actual point of contact, the temperature as
high as 1000°C is reached for a very short duration (i.e. for 0.0001 second). Due to this, the temperature of
the contact surfaces will increase and may destroy the clutch.

24.6 Considerations in Designing a Friction Clutch
The following considerations must be kept in mind while designing a friction clutch.
1.
The suitable material forming the contact surfaces should be selected.
2.
The moving parts of the clutch should have low weight in order to minimise the inertia load,
especially in high speed service.
3.
The clutch should not require any external force to maintain contact of the friction surfaces.
4.
The provision for taking up wear of the contact surfaces must be provided.
5.
The clutch should have provision for facilitating repairs.
6.
The clutch should have provision for carrying away the heat generated at the contact
surfaces.
7.
The projecting parts of the clutch should be covered by guard.
24.7 Types of Friction Clutches
Though there are many types of friction clutches, yet the following are important from the
subject point of view :
1.
Disc or plate clutches (single disc or multiple disc clutch),
2.
Cone clutches, and
3.
Centrifugal clutches.
We shall now discuss these clutches, in detail, in the following pages.
Note : The disc and cone clutches are known as axial friction clutches, while the centrifugal clutch is called
radial friction clutch.

888    A Textbook of Machine Design
24.8 Single Disc or Plate Clutch
Fig. 24.2. Single disc or plate clutch.
A single disc or plate clutch, as shown in Fig 24.2, consists of a clutch plate whose both sides
are faced with a frictional material (usually of Ferrodo). It is mounted on the hub which is free to
move axially along the splines of the driven shaft. The pressure plate is mounted inside the clutch
body which is bolted to the flywheel. Both the pressure plate and the flywheel rotate with the engine
crankshaft or the driving shaft. The pressure plate pushes the clutch plate towards the flywheel by a
set of strong springs which are arranged radially inside the body. The three levers (also known as
release levers or fingers) are carried on pivots suspended from the case of the body. These are
arranged in such a manner so that the pressure plate moves away from the flywheel by the inward
movement of a thrust bearing. The bearing is mounted upon a forked shaft and moves forward when
the clutch pedal is pressed.
When the clutch pedal is pressed down, its linkage forces the thrust release bearing to move in
towards the flywheel and pressing the longer
ends of the levers inward. The levers are
forced to turn on their suspended pivot and
the pressure plate moves away from the
flywheel by the knife edges, thereby
compressing the clutch springs. This action
removes the pressure from the clutch plate
and thus moves back from the flywheel and
the driven shaft becomes stationary. On the
other hand, when the foot is taken off from
the clutch pedal, the thrust bearing moves
back by the levers. This allows the springs
to extend and thus the pressure plate pushes
the clutch plate back towards the flywheel.
 When a car hits an object and decelerates quickly
the objects are thrown forward as they continue to
move forwards due to inertia.

Clutches    889
The axial pressure exerted by the spring provides a frictional force in the circumferential direction
when the relative motion between the driving and driven members tends to take place. If the torque
due to this frictional force exceeds the torque to be transmitted, then no slipping takes place and the
power is transmitted from the driving shaft to the driven shaft.
24.9 Design of a Disc or Plate Clutch
Consider two friction surfaces maintained in contact by an axial thrust (W ) as shown in
Fig. 24.3 (a).
Fig. 24.3. Forces on a disc clutch.
Let
 T = Torque transmitted by the clutch,
p = Intensity of axial pressure with which the contact surfaces are
held together,
r1 and r2 = External and internal radii of friction faces,
r = Mean radius of the friction face, and
μ = Coefficient of friction.
Consider an elementary ring of radius r and thickness dr as shown in Fig. 24.3 (b).
We know that area of the contact surface or friction surface
= 2π r.dr
∴  Normal or axial force on the ring,
δW = Pressure × Area = p × 2π r.dr
and the frictional force on the ring acting tangentially at radius r,
Fr = μ × δW = μ.p × 2π r.dr
∴  Frictional torque acting on the ring,
Tr = Fr × r = μ.p × 2π r.dr × r = 2 π μ p. r2.dr
We shall now consider the following two cases :
1. When there is a uniform pressure, and
2. When there is a uniform axial wear.
1. Considering uniform pressure. When the pressure is uniformly distributed over the entire
area of the friction face as shown in Fig. 24.3 (a), then the intensity of pressure,

2. Considering uniform axial wear. The basic principle in designing machine parts that are
subjected to wear due to sliding friction is that the normal wear is proportional to the work of friction.
The work of friction is proportional to the product of normal pressure ( p) and the sliding velocity
(V). Therefore,
Normal wear ∝ Work of friction ∝ p.V
or
p.V = K (a constant)  or  p = K/V
...(i)
It may be noted that when the friction surface is new, there
is a uniform pressure distribution over the entire contact surface.
This pressure will wear most rapidly where the sliding velocity
is maximum and this will reduce the pressure between the friction
surfaces. This wearing-in process continues until the product
p.V is constant over the entire surface. After this, the wear will
be uniform as shown in Fig. 24.4.
Let p be the normal intensity of pressure at a distance r
from the axis of the clutch. Since the intensity of pressure varies
inversely with the distance, therefore
p.r = C (a constant)  or  p = C / r

2. For a single disc or plate clutch, normally both sides of the disc are effective. Therefore a single disc
clutch has two pairs of surfaces in contact (i.e. n = 2).
3. Since the intensity of pressure is maximum at the inner radius (r2) of the friction or contact surface,
therefore equation (ii) may be written as
pmax × r2 = C
  or
pmax = C / r2
4. Since the intensity of pressure is minimum at the outer radius (r1) of the friction or contact surface,
therefore equation (ii) may be written as
pmin × r1 = C

pmin = C / r1

6. In case of a new clutch, the intensity of pressure is approximately uniform, but in an old clutch, the
uniform wear theory is more approximate.
7. The uniform pressure theory gives a higher friction torque
than the uniform wear theory. Therefore in case of friction clutches,
uniform wear should be considered, unless otherwise stated.
24.10 Multiple Disc Clutch
A multiple disc clutch, as shown in Fig. 24.5, may be
used when a large torque is to be transmitted. The inside
discs (usually of steel) are fastened to the driven shaft to
permit axial motion (except for the last disc). The outside
discs (usually of bronze) are held by bolts and are fastened
to the housing which is keyed to the driving shaft. The
multiple disc clutches are extensively used in motor cars,
machine tools etc.

Example 24.1. Determine the maximum, minimum and average pressure in a plate clutch
when the axial force is 4 kN. The inside radius of the contact surface is 50 mm and the outside radius
is 100 mm. Assume uniform wear.
Solution. Given : W = 4 kN = 4000 N ; r2 = 50 mm ; r1 = 100 mm

Maximum intensity of pressure
For uniform wear conditions, p.r = C (a constant). Since the intensity of pressure is maximum at
the inner radius (r2), therefore
pmax × r2 = C
or
C = pmax × 75 N/mm
We know that the axial thrust ( W ),
9011 = 2 π C (r1 – r2) = 2π × pmax × 75 (150 – 75) = 35 347 pmax
∴
pmax = 9011 / 35 347 = 0.255 N/mm2

Example 24.3. A single plate clutch, effective on both sides, is required to transmit 25 kW at
3000 r.p.m. Determine the outer and inner diameters of frictional surface if the coefficient of friction
is 0.255, ratio of diameters is 1.25 and the maximum pressure is not to exceed 0.1 N/mm2. Also,
determine the axial thrust to be provided by springs. Assume the theory of uniform wear.
Solution. Given : n = 2 ; P = 25 kW = 25 × 103 W ; N = 3000 r.p.m. ; μ = 0.255 ;
d1 / d2 = 1.25  or  r1 / r2 = 1.25 ; pmax = 0.1 N/mm2

W = 2π C (r1 – r2) = 2π × 0.1 r2 (1.25 r2 – r2)

Example 24.4. A dry single plate clutch is to be designed for an automotive vehicle whose
engine is rated to give 100 kW at 2400 r.p.m. and maximum torque 500 N-m. The outer radius of the
friction plate is 25% more than the inner radius. The intensity of pressure between the plate is not to
exceed 0.07 N/mm2. The coefficient of friction may be assumed equal to 0.3. The helical springs
required by this clutch to provide axial force necessary to engage the clutch are eight. If each spring
has stiffness equal to 40 N/mm, determine the dimensions of the friction plate and initial compres-
sion in the springs.
Solution. Given : P = 100 kW = 100 × 103 W ; *N = 2400 r.p.m. ; T = 500 N-m
= 500 × 103 N-mm ; p = 0.07 N/mm2 ; μ = 0.3 ; No. of springs = 8 ; Stiffness/spring = 40 N/mm
Dimensions of the friction plate
Let
 r1 = Outer radius of the friction plate, and
r2 = Inner radius of the friction plate.
Since the outer radius of the friction plate is 25% more than the inner radius, therefore
r1 = 1.25 r2
For uniform wear conditions, p.r = C (a constant). Since the intensity of pressure is maximum at
the inner radius (r2), therefore
p.r2 = C  or C = 0.07 r2 N/mm

N-m at 2000 r.p.m. The outside diameter of the clutch is 250 mm and the clutch is engaged at 55 km/h.
Find : 1. the number of revolutions of the clutch slip during engagement; and 2. heat to be dissipated
by the clutch for each engagement.
The following additional data is available:
Engine torque during engagement = 100 N-m; Mass of the automobile = 1500 kg; Diameter of
the automobile wheel = 0.7 m; Moment of inertia of combined engine rotating parts, flywheel and
input side of the clutch = 1 kg-m2; Gear reduction ratio at differential = 5; Torque at rear wheels
available for accelerating automobile = 175 N-m; Coefficient of friction for the clutch material
= 0.3; Permissible pressure = 0.13 N/mm2.
Solution. Given : T = 250 N-m = 250 × 103 N-mm ; N = 2000 r.p.m. ; d1 = 250 mm or
r1 = 125 mm ; V = 55 km/h = 15.3 m/s ; Te = 100 N-m ; m = 1500 kg ; Dw = 0.7 m or Rw = 0.35 m ;
I = 1 kg-m2 ; Ta = 175 N-m ; Gear ratio = 5 ; μ = 0.3 ; p = 0.13 N/mm2

We know that the torque transmitted (T ),
250 × 103 = n.μ.W.R = 2 × 0.3 × 0.13 π [(125)2 – (r2)2] [62.5 + 0.5 r2]

Solving by hit and trial, we find that

Example 24.7. A multiple disc clutch has five plates having four pairs of active friction
surfaces. If the intensity of pressure is not to exceed 0.127 N/mm2,
find the power transmitted at 500 r.p.m. The outer and inner radii
of friction surfaces are 125 mm and 75 mm respectively. Assume
uniform wear and take coefficient of friction = 0.3.
Solution. Given : n1 + n2 = 5 ; n = 4 ; p = 0.127 N/mm2 ;
N = 500 r.p.m. ; r1 = 125 mm ; r2 = 75 mm ; μ = 0.3
We know that for uniform wear, p.r = C (a constant). Since
the intensity of pressure is maximum at the inner radius (r2),
therefore,
               p.r2 = C     or    C = 0.127 × 75 = 9.525 N/mm

n = 57 300 / 19 965 = 2.87
Since the number of pairs of contact surfaces must be even, therefore we shall use 4 pairs of
contact surfaces with 3 steel discs and 2 bronze discs (because the number of pairs of contact surfaces
is one less than the total number of discs).

therefore,

C = 40 pmax N/mm
We know that the actual axial force (W '),
2604.5 = 2πC (r1 – r2) = 2π × 40 pmax ( 70 – 40) = 7541 pmax
∴

24.11 Cone Clutch
A cone clutch, as shown in Fig. 24.6, was extensively used in automobiles, but now-a-days it
has been replaced completely by the disc clutch. It consists of one pair of friction surface only. In a
cone clutch, the driver is keyed to the driving shaft by a sunk key and has an inside conical surface or
face which exactly fits into the outside conical surface of the driven. The driven member resting on
the feather key in the driven shaft, may be shifted along the shaft by a forked lever provided at B, in
order to engage the clutch by bringing the two conical surfaces in contact. Due to the frictional
resistance set up at this contact surface, the torque is transmitted from one shaft to another. In some
cases, a spring is placed around the driven shaft in contact with the hub of the driven. This spring

holds the clutch faces in contact and maintains the pressure between them, and the forked lever is
used only for disengagement of the clutch. The contact surfaces of the clutch may be metal to metal
contact, but more often the driven member is lined with some material like wood, leather, cork or
asbestos etc. The material of the clutch faces (i.e. contact surfaces) depends upon the allowable
normal pressure and the coefficient of friction.

Consider a pair of friction surfaces of a cone clutch as shown in Fig. 24.7. A little consideration
will show that the area of contact of a pair of friction surface is a frustrum of a cone.

Consider a small ring of radius r and thickness dr as shown in Fig. 24.7. Let dl is the length of
ring of the friction surface, such that,

Area of ring = 2π r. dl = 2π r.dr cosec α
We shall now consider the following two cases :
1. When there is a uniform pressure, and
2. When there is a uniform wear.

We know that the normal force acting on the ring,

or
W = pn × 2π R.b sin α = Wn sin α
where
Wn = Normal load acting on the friction surface = pn × 2πR.b
Now the equation (iv) may be written as
T = μ ( pn × 2π R. b sin α) R cosec α = 2π μ.pn R2.b
The following points may be noted for a cone clutch :
1. The above equations are valid for steady operation of the clutch and after the clutch is
engaged.
2. If the clutch is engaged when one member is stationary and the other rotating (i.e. during
engagement of the clutch) as shown in Fig. 24.8 (b), then the cone faces will tend to slide on each
other due to the presence of relative motion. Thus an additional force (of magnitude μ.Wn cos α) acts
on the clutch which resists the engagement, and the axial force required for engaging the clutch
increases.
∴Axial force required for engaging the clutch,
We = W + μ.Wn cos α = Wn. sin α + μ Wn cos α
= Wn (sin α + μ cos α)
It has been found experimentally that the term (μ Wn.cos α) is only 25 percent effective.
∴
We = Wn sin α + 0.25 μ Wn cos α = Wn (sin α + 0.25 μ cos α)
3. Under steady operation of the clutch, a decrease in the semi-cone angle (α) increases the
torque produced by the clutch (T ) and reduces the axial force (W ). During engaging period, the axial
force required for engaging the clutch (We ) increases under the influence of friction as the angle α
decreases. The value of α can not be decreased much because smaller semi-cone angle (α) requires
larger axial force for its disengagement.
If the clutch is to be designed for free disengagement, the value of tan α must be greater than μ.
In case the value of tan α is less than μ, the clutch will not disengage itself and axial force required to
disengage the clutch is given by
Wd = Wn ( μ cos α – sin α)
Example 24.11. The contact surfaces in a cone clutch have an effective diameter of 80 mm. The
semi-angle of the cone is 15° and coefficient of friction is 0.3. Find the torque required to produce
slipping of the clutch, if the axial force applied is 200 N. The clutch is employed to connect an
electric motor, running uniformly at 900 r.p.m. with a flywheel which is initially stationary. The
flywheel has a mass of 14 kg and its radius of gyration is 160 mm. Calculate the time required for the
flywheel to attain full-speed and also the energy lost in slipping of the clutch.
Solution. Given : D = 80 mm or R = 40 mm ; α = 15° ; μ = 0.3 ; W = 200 N ; N = 900 r.p.m.
or  ω = 2π × 900/60 = 94.26 rad/s ; m = 14 kg ; k = 160 mm = 0.16 m
Torque required to produce slipping of the clutch
We know that the torque required to produce slipping of the clutch,
T = μ WR cosec α = 0.3 × 200 × 40 cosec 15° = 9273 N-mm

Time required for the flywheel to attain full-speed
Let
 t = Time required for the flywheel to attain full speed from the stationary
position, and
α = Angular acceleration of the flywheel.
We know that mass moment of inertia of the flywheel,
I = m.k2 = 14 (0.16)2 = 0.3584 kg-m2
We also know that the torque ( T ),
9.273 = I × α = 0.3584 α
∴
α = 9.273 / 0.3584 = 25.87 rad / s2
and angular speed (ω),
94.26 = ω0 + α.t = 0 + 25.87 × t = 25.87 t
... (Q ω0 = 0)
∴

Determine : 1. the face width required, and 2. the axial spring force necessary to engage the clutch.
Solution. Given : P = 45 kW = 45 × 103 W ; N = 1000 r.p.m. ; α = 12.5° ; D = 500 mm or

2.  Axial spring force necessary to engage the clutch
We know that the normal force acting on the contact surfaces,
Wn = pn × 2πR.b = 0.1 × 2π × 250 × 55 = 8640 N
∴Axial spring force necessary to engage the clutch,

Fig. 24.9
Now let us find the principal dimensions of a cone clutch.
Let
 D = Mean diameter of the clutch,
R = Mean radius of the clutch, and
b = Face width of the clutch.
Since the allowable normal pressure ( pn ) for leather and cast iron is 0.075 to 0.1 N/mm2,
therefore let us take pn = 0.1 N/mm2.
We know that the torque developed by the clutch ( T ),
668.4 × 103 = 2 π μ. pn. R2.b = 2π × 0.2 × 0.1 × R2 × 3
R  = 0.042 R3
... (Q D / b = 6  or  2R / b = 6  or  R / b = 3)
∴
R3 = 668.4 × 103 / 0.042 = 15.9 × 106   or  R = 250 mm
and
D = 2R = 2 × 250 = 500 mm Ans.
Since this calculated value of the mean diameter of the clutch (D) is equal to 10 d and the given
value of D is 6 to 10d, therefore the calculated value of D is safe.
We know that face width of the clutch,
b = D / 6 = 500 / 6 = 83.3 mm  Ans.

24.13 Centrifugal Clutch
The centrifugal clutches are usually incorporated into
the motor pulleys. It consists of a number of shoes on the
inside of a rim of the pulley, as shown in Fig. 24.10. The
outer surface of the shoes are covered with a friction
material. These shoes, which can move radially in guides,
are held against the boss (or spider) on the driving shaft
by means of springs. The springs exert a radially inward
force which is assumed constant. The weight of the shoe,
when revolving causes it to exert a radially outward force
(i.e. centrifugal force). The magnitude of this centrifugal
force depends upon the speed at which the shoe is
revolving. A little consideration will show that when the
centrifugal force is less than the spring force, the shoe
remains in the same position as when the driving shaft
was stationary, but when the centrifugal force is equal to
the spring force, the shoe is just floating. When the
centrifugal force exceeds the spring force, the shoe moves
outward and comes into contact with the driven member
and presses against it. The force with which the shoe presses against the driven member is the difference
of the centrifugal force and the spring force. The increase of speed causes the shoe to press harder and
enables more torque to be transmitted.
Fig. 24.10. Centrifugal clutch.
24.14 Design of a Centrifugal Clutch
In designing a centrifugal clutch, it is required to determine the weight of the shoe, size of the
shoe and dimensions of the spring. The following procedure may be adopted for the design of a
centrifugal clutch.
1. Mass of the shoes
Consider one shoe of a centrifugal clutch as shown in Fig. 24.11.
Let
 m = Mass of each shoe,
n = Number of shoes,
Centrifugal clutch with three discs
and four steel float plates.

ω
= Angular running speed of the pulley in rad / s
 = 2 π N / 60 rad/s,
ω1
= Angular speed at which the engagement  begins to
take place, and
μ
= Coefficient of friction between the shoe and rim.
We know that the centrifugal force acting on each shoe at
the running speed,
    *Pc =  m.ω2.r
Since the speed at which the engagement begins to take
place is generally taken as 3/4th of the running speed, therefore
the inward force on each shoe exerted by the spring is given by

and the frictional force acting tangentially on each shoe,

∴ Frictional torque acting on each shoe
= F × R = μ (Pc – Ps) R
and total frictional torque transmitted,
T = μ (Pc – Ps) R × n = n.F.R
From this expression, the mass of the shoes (m) may be evaluated.
2. Size of the shoes
Let
 l = Contact length of the shoes,
b = Width of the shoes,
R = Contact radius of the shoes. It is same as the inside radius of the rim
of the pulley,
θ = Angle subtended by the shoes at the centre of the spider in  radians, and
p = Intensity of pressure exerted on the shoe. In order to ensure reasonable
life, it may be taken as 0.1 N/mm2.

The radial  clearance between the shoe and the rim is about 1.5 mm. Since this clearance is small as
compared to r, therefore it is neglected for  design purposes. If, however, the radial clearance is given, then
the operating radius of the mass centre of the shoe from the axis of the clutch,
r1 = r + c, where c is the radial clearance,
Then
Pc = m.ω2 r1  and  Ps = m (ω1)2 r1

The inside radius of the pulley rim is 150 mm. The shoes are lined with Ferrodo for which the
coefficient of friction may be taken as 0.25. Determine: 1. mass of the shoes, and 2. size of the shoes.
Solution.  Given : P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W ; N = 900 r.p.m. ; n = 4 ; R = 150 mm = 0.15 m ;

25.1 Introduction
A brake is a device by means of which artificial
frictional resistance is applied to a moving machine member,
in order to retard or stop the motion of a machine. In the
process of performing this function, the brake absorbs either
kinetic energy of the moving member or potential energy
given up by objects being lowered by hoists, elevators etc.
The energy absorbed by brakes is dissipated in the form of
heat. This heat is dissipated in the surrounding air (or water
which is circulated through the passages in the brake drum)
so that excessive heating of the brake lining does not take
place. The design or capacity of a brake depends upon the
following factors :
1. The unit pressure between the braking surfaces,
2. The coefficient of friction between the braking
surfaces,
3. The peripheral velocity of the brake drum,
Contents

4. The projected area of the friction surfaces, and
5. The ability of the brake to dissipate heat equivalent to the energy being absorbed.
The major functional difference between a clutch and a brake is that a clutch is used to keep the
driving and driven member moving together, whereas brakes are used to stop a moving member or to
control its speed.
25.2 Energy Absorbed by a Brake
The energy absorbed by a brake depends upon the type of motion of the moving body. The
motion of a body may be either pure translation or pure rotation or a combination of both translation
and rotation. The energy corresponding to these motions is kinetic energy. Let us consider these
motions as follows :
1. When the motion of the body is pure translation. Consider a body of mass (m) moving with
a velocity v1 m / s. Let its velocity is reduced to v2 m / s by applying the brake. Therefore, the change
in kinetic energy of the translating body or kinetic energy of translation,

2. When the motion of the body is pure rotation. Consider a body of mass moment of inertia
I (about a given axis) is rotating about that axis with an angular velocity ω1 rad / s. Let its angular
velocity is reduced to ω2 rad / s after applying the brake. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy of

3. When the motion of the body is a combination of translation and rotation. Consider a
body having both linear and angular motions, e.g. in the locomotive driving wheels and wheels of a
moving car. In such cases, the total kinetic energy of the body is equal to the sum of the kinetic
energies of translation and rotation.
∴Total kinetic energy to be absorbed by the brake,
E = E1 + E2
Sometimes, the brake has to absorb the potential energy given up by objects being lowered by
hoists, elevators etc. Consider a body of mass m is being lowered from a height h1 to h2 by applying
the brake. Therefore the change in potential energy,
E3 = m.g (h1 – h2)
If v1 and v2 m / s are the velocities of the mass before and after the brake is applied, then the
change in potential energy is given by

Thus, the total energy to be absorbed by the brake,
E = E1 + E2 + E3
Let
Ft = Tangential braking force or frictional force acting tangentially at the
contact surface of the brake drum,
d = Diameter of the brake drum,

We know that the work done by the braking or frictional force in time t seconds

force, therefore

25.3 Heat to be Dissipated during Braking
The energy absorbed by the brake and transformed into heat must be dissipated to the surrounding
air in order to avoid excessive temperature rise of the brake lining. The *temperature rise depends
upon the mass of the brake drum, the braking time and the heat dissipation capacity of the brake. The
highest permissible temperatures recommended for different brake lining materials are given as
follows :
1. For leather, fibre and wood facing = 65 – 70°C
2. For asbestos and metal surfaces that are slightly lubricated = 90 – 105°C
3. For automobile brakes with asbestos block lining = 180 – 225°C
Since the energy absorbed (or heat generated) and the rate of wear of the brake lining at a
particular speed are dependent on the normal pressure between the braking surfaces, therefore it is an
important factor in the design of brakes. The permissible normal pressure between the braking surfaces
depends upon the material of the brake lining, the coefficient of friction and the maximum rate at
which the energy is to be absorbed. The energy absorbed or the heat generated is given by
E = Hg = μ.RN.v = μ.p.A.v (in J/s or watts)
...(i)
where
μ = Coefficient of friction,
RN = Normal force acting at the contact surfaces, in newtons,
p = Normal pressure between the braking surfaces in N/m2,
A = Projected area of the contact surfaces in m2, and
v = Peripheral velocity of the brake drum in m/s.
The heat generated may also be obtained by considering the amount of kinetic or potential
energies which is being absorbed. In other words,
Hg = EK + EP
where
EK = Total kinetic energy absorbed, and
EP = Total potential energy absorbed.
The heat dissipated (Hd) may be estimated by
Hd = C (t1 – t2) Ar
...(ii)
where
C = Heat dissipation factor or coefficient of heat transfer in W /m2 / °C
t1 – t2 = Temperature difference between the exposed radiating surface and the
surrounding air in °C, and
Ar = Area of radiating surface in m2.
The value of C may be of the order of 29.5 W / m2 /°C for a temperature difference of 40°C and
increase up to 44 W/m2/°C for a temperature difference of 200°C.
The expressions for the heat dissipated are quite approximate and should serve only as an
indication of the capacity of the brake to dissipate heat. The exact performance of the brake should be
determined by test.
It has been found that 10 to 25 per cent of the heat generated is immediately dissipated to the
surrounding air while the remaining heat is absorbed by the brake drum causing its temperature to
rise. The rise in temperature of the brake drum is given by
Δ t =
.
g
H
mc
...(iii)
where
Δ t = Temperature rise of the brake drum in °C,
*
When the temperature increases, the coefficient of friction decreases which adversely affect the torque
capacity of the brake. At high temperature, there is a rapid wear of friction lining, which reduces the life of
lining. Therefore, the temperature rise should be kept within the permissible range.

Brakes    921
Hg = Heat generated by the brake in joules,
m = Mass of the brake drum in kg, and
c = Specific heat for the material of the brake drum in J/kg °C.
In brakes, it is very difficult to precisely calculate the temperature rise. In preliminary design
analysis, the product p.v is considered in place of temperature rise. The experience has also shown
that if the product p.v is high, the rate of wear of brake lining will be high and the brake life will be
low. Thus the value of p.v should be lower than the upper limit value for the brake lining to have
reasonable wear life. The following table shows the recommended values of p.v as suggested by
various designers for different types of service.

Example 25.1. A vehicle of mass 1200 kg is moving down the hill at a slope of 1: 5 at
72 km / h. It is to be stopped in a distance of 50 m. If the diameter of the tyre is 600 mm, determine the
average braking torque to be applied to stop the vehicle, neglecting all the frictional energy except
for the brake. If the friction energy is momentarily stored in a 20 kg cast iron brake drum, What is
average temperature rise of the drum? The specific heat for cast iron may be taken as 520 J / kg°C.
Determine, also, the minimum coefficient of friction between the tyres and the road in order
that the wheels do not skid, assuming that the weight is equally distributed among all the four wheels.
Solution. Given : m = 1200 kg ; Slope = 1: 5 ; v = 72 km / h = 20 m/s ; h = 50 m ; d = 600 mm
or r = 300 mm = 0.3 m ; mb = 20 kg ; c = 520 J / kg°C

∴Total energy of the vehicle or the energy to be absorbed by the brake,
E = EK + EP = 240 000 + 117 720 = 357 720 N-m
Since the vehicle is to be stopped in a distance of 50 m, therefore tangential braking force
required,
Ft = 357 720 / 50 = 7154.4 N
We know that average braking torque to be applied to stop the vehicle,
TB = Ft × r = 7154.4 × 0.3 = 2146.32 N-m   Ans.

The rechargeable battery found in most cars is a combination of lead acid cells. A small dynamo,
driven by the vehicle’s engine, charges the battery whenever the engine is running.
Average temperature rise of the drum
Let
Δ t = Average temperature rise of the drum in °C.
We know that the heat absorbed by the brake drum,
Hg = Energy absorbed by the brake drum
= 357 720 N-m = 357 720 J
... (Q 1 N-m = 1 J)
We also know that the heat absorbed by the brake drum (Hg),
357 720 = mb × c × Δ t = 20 × 520 × Δ t = 10 400 Δ t
∴
Δ t = 357 720 / 10 400 = 34.4°C Ans.
Minimum coefficient of friction between the tyre and road
Let
μ = Minimum coefficient of friction between the tyre and road, and
RN = Normal force between the contact surface. This is equal to weight of
the vehicle
= m.g = 1200 × 9.81 = 11 772 N
We know that tangential braking force (Ft),
7154.4 = μ.RN = μ × 11 772
∴
μ = 7154.4 / 11772 = 0.6 Ans.
25.4 Materials for Brake Lining
The material used for the brake lining should have the following characteristics :
1. It should have high coefficient of friction with minimum fading. In other words, the coefficient
of friction should remain constant over the entire surface with change in temperature.
2. It should have low wear rate.
3. It should have high heat resistance.
4. It should have high heat dissipation capacity.
5. It should have low coefficient of thermal expansion.
6. It should have adequate mechanical strength.
7. It should not be affected by moisture and oil.

25.5 Types of Brakes
The brakes, according to the means used for transforming the energy by the braking element,
are classified as :
1. Hydraulic brakes e.g. pumps or hydrodynamic brake and fluid agitator,
2. Electric brakes e.g. generators and eddy current brakes, and
3. Mechanical brakes.
The hydraulic and electric brakes cannot bring the member to rest and are mostly used where
large amounts of energy are to be transformed while the brake is retarding the load such as in laboratory
dynamometers, high way trucks and electric locomotives. These brakes are also used for retarding or
controlling the speed of a vehicle for down-hill travel.
The mechanical brakes, according to the direction of acting force, may be divided into the
following two groups :
Shoes of disk brakes of a racing car
Contents
Top
924    A Textbook of Machine Design
(a) Radial brakes. In these brakes, the force acting on the brake drum is in radial direction. The
radial brakes may be sub-divided into external brakes and internal brakes. According to
the shape of the friction element, these brakes may be block or shoe brakes and band brakes.
(b) Axial brakes. In these brakes, the force acting on the brake drum is in axial direction. The
axial brakes may be disc brakes and cone brakes. The analysis of these brakes is similar to
clutches.
Since we are concerned with only mechanical brakes, therefore, these are discussed in detail, in
the following pages.
25.6 Single Block or Shoe Brake
A single block or shoe brake is shown in Fig. 25.1. It consists of a block or shoe which is
pressed against the rim of a revolving brake wheel drum. The block is made of a softer material than
Fig. 25.1. Single block brake. Line of action of tangential force passes through the fulcrum of the lever.
the rim of the wheel. This type of a brake is commonly used on railway trains and tram cars. The
friction between the block and the wheel causes a tangential braking force to act on the wheel, which
retard the rotation of the wheel. The block is pressed against the wheel by a force applied to one end
of a lever to which the block is rigidly fixed as shown in Fig. 25.1. The other end of the lever is
pivoted on a fixed fulcrum O.
Let
P = Force applied at the end of the lever,
RN = Normal force pressing the brake block on the wheel,
r = Radius of the wheel,
2θ = Angle of contact surface of the block,
μ = Coefficient of friction, and
Ft = Tangential braking force or the frictional force acting at the contact
surface of the block and the wheel.
If the angle of contact is less than 60°, then it may be assumed that the normal pressure between
the block and the wheel is uniform. In such cases, tangential braking force on the wheel,
Ft = μ.RN
...(i)
and the braking torque,TB = Ft. r = μ RN . r
...(ii)
Let us now consider the following three cases :
Case 1. When the line of action of tangential braking force (Ft) passes through the fulcrum O of
the lever, and the brake wheel rotates clockwise as shown in Fig. 25.1 (a), then for equilibrium, taking
moments about the fulcrum O, we have

Notes: 1. From above we see that when the brake wheel rotates anticlockwise in case 2 [Fig. 25.2 (b)] and when
it rotates clockwise in case 3 [Fig. 25.3 (a)], the equations (i) and (ii) are same, i.e.
                          RN × x = P.l + μ.RN.a
From this we see that the moment of
frictional force (μ. RN.a) adds to the moment of
force (P.l). In other words, the frictional force
helps to apply the brake. Such type of brakes
are said to be self energizing brakes. When the
frictional force is great enough to apply the brake
with no external force, then the brake is said to
be self-locking brake.
From the above expression, we see that if
x ≤ μ.a, then P will be negative or equal to zero.
This means no external force is needed to apply
the brake and hence the brake is self locking.
Therefore the condition for the brake to be self
locking is
x ≤ μ.a
The self-locking brake is used only in
back-stop applications.
2.
The brake should be self-energizing and not the self-locking.
3.
In order to avoid self-locking and to prevent the brake from grabbing, x is kept greater than μ.a.
4.
If Ab is the projected bearing area of the block or shoe, then the bearing pressure on the shoe,
pb = RN / Ab
We know that Ab = Width of shoe × Projected length of shoe = w (2r sin θ)
5. When a single block or shoe brake is applied to a rolling wheel, an additional load is thrown on the
shaft bearings due to heavy normal force (RN) and produces bending of the shaft. In order to overcome this
drawback, a double block or shoe brake, as discussed in Art. 25.8, is used.
25.7 Pivoted Block or Shoe Brake
We have discussed in the previous article that when the angle of contact is less than 60°, then it
may be assumed that the normal pressure between the block and the wheel is uniform. But when the
angle of contact is greater than 60°, then the unit pressure normal to the surface of contact is less at the
ends than at the centre. In such cases, the block or shoe is pivoted to the lever as shown in Fig. 25.4,
instead of being rigidly attached to the lever. This gives uniform wear of the brake lining in the
direction of the applied force. The braking torque for a pivoted block or shoe brake (i.e. when 2θ > 60°)
is given by

Example 25.2. A single block brake is shown in Fig. 25.5. The diameter of the drum is 250 mm
and the angle of contact is 90°. If the operating force of 700 N is applied at the end of a lever and the
coefficient of friction between the drum and the lining is 0.35, determine the torque that may be
transmitted by the block brake.
Solution. Given : d = 250 mm or r = 125 mm ; 2θ = 90° = π / 2 rad ; P = 700 N ; μ = 0.35

Example 25.3. Fig. 25.6 shows a brake shoe applied to a drum by a lever AB which is pivoted
at a fixed point A and rigidly fixed to the shoe. The radius of the drum is 160 mm. The coefficient of
friction of the brake lining is 0.3. If the drum rotates clockwise, find the braking torque due to the
horizontal force of 600 N applied at B.
Solution. Given : r = 160 mm = 0.16 m ; μ = 0.3 ; P = 600 N
Since the angle subtended by the shoe at the centre of the drum is 40°, therefore we need not to
calculate the equivalent coefficient of friction (μ').
Let
RN = Normal force pressing the shoe on the drum, and
Ft = Tangential braking force = μ.RN

μ = 0.3
1.    Force (P) for the clockwise and counter clockwise rotation of the brake drum
For the clockwise rotation of the brake drum, the frictional force or the tangential force (Ft)

We know that braking torque (TB),
360 = Ft × r = Ft × 0.15   or  Ft = 360 / 0.15 = 2400 N
and normal force,
RN = Ft / μ = 2400 / 0.3 = 8000 N
Now taking moments about the fulcrum O, we have
P (600 + 200) + Ft × 50 = RN × 200
P × 800 + 2400 × 50 = 8000 × 200
P × 800 = 8000 × 200 – 2400 × 50 = 1480 × 103
∴
P = 1480 × 103 / 800 = 1850 N Ans.
For the counter clockwise rotation of the drum, the frictional force or the tangential force (Ft)
acting at the contact surfaces is shown in Fig. 25.9.
Taking moments about the fulcrum O, we have
P (600 + 200) = Ft × 50 + RN × 200
P × 800 = 2400 × 50 + 8000 × 200 = 1720 × 103
∴
P = 1720 × 103 / 800 = 2150 N Ans.
2.  Location of the pivot or fulcrum to make the brake self-locking
The clockwise rotation of the brake drum is shown in Fig. 25.8. Let x be the distance of the pivot
or fulcrum O from the line of action of the tangential force (Ft). Taking moments about the fulcrum O,
we have
P (600 + 200) + Ft × x – RN × 200 = 0
In order to make the brake self-locking, Ft × x must be equal to RN × 200 so that the force P is
zero.
∴
Ft × x = RN × 200
2400 × x = 8000 × 200
or   x = 8000 × 200 / 2400 = 667 mm  Ans.
Example 25.5. A rope drum of an elevator having 650 mm diameter is fitted with a brake drum
of 1 m diameter. The brake drum is provided with four cast iron brake shoes each subtending an
angle of 45°. The mass of the elevator when loaded is 2000 kg and moves with a speed of 2.5 m / s.
The brake has a sufficient capacity to stop the elevator in 2.75 metres. Assuming the coefficient of
friction between the brake drum and shoes as 0.2, find: 1. width of the shoe, if the allowable pressure
on the brake shoe is limited to 0.3 N/mm2; and 2. heat generated in stopping the elevator.
Solution. Given : de = 650 mm  or  re = 325 mm = 0.325 m ; d = 1 m or r = 0.5 m = 500 mm ;
n = 4 ; 2 θ = 45°  or  θ = 22.5° ; m = 2000 kg ; v = 2.5 m / s ; h = 2.75 m ; μ = 0.2 ; pb = 0.3 N/mm2
1. Width of the shoe
Let
w = Width of the shoe in mm.
First of all, let us find out the acceleration of the rope (a). We know that
v2 – u2 = 2 a.h   or   (2.5)2 – 0 = 2a × 2.75 = 5.5a
∴
a = (2.5)2 / 5.5 = 1.136 m/s2
and
accelerating force = Mass × Acceleration = m × a = 2000 × 1.136 = 2272 N
∴Total load acting on the rope while moving,
W = Load on the elevator in newtons + Accelerating force
= 2000 × 9.81 + 2272 = 21 892 N
We know that torque acting on the shaft,
T = W × re = 21 892 × 0.325 = 7115 N-m

The brake drum is provided with four cast iron shoes, therefore tangential force acting on each

coefficient of friction (μ').
∴Normal load on each shoe,
RN = Ft / μ = 3557.5 / 0.2 = 17 787.5 N
We know that the projected bearing area of each shoe,

25.8 Double Block or Shoe Brake
When a single block brake is applied to a rolling wheel, and additional load is thrown on the
shaft bearings due to the normal force (RN). This produces bending of the shaft. In order to overcome
this drawback, a double block or shoe brake as shown in Fig. 25.10, is used. It consists of two brake
blocks applied at the opposite ends of a diameter of the wheel which eliminate or reduces the unbal-
anced force on the shaft. The brake is set by a spring which
pulls the upper ends of the brake arms together. When a force
P is applied to the bell crank lever, the spring is compressed
and the brake is released. This type of brake is often used on
electric cranes and the force P is produced by an electromag-
net or solenoid. When the current is switched off, there is no
force on the bell crank lever and the brake is engaged auto-
matically due to the spring force and thus there will be no
downward movement of the load.
In a double block brake, the braking action is doubled
by the use of two blocks and the two blocks may be operated
practically by the same force which will operate one. In case
of double block or shoe brake, the braking torque is given by
TB = (Ft1 + Ft2) r
where Ft1 and Ft2 are the braking forces on the two blocks.
Example 25.6. A double shoe brake, as shown in Fig. 25.11 is capable of absorbing a torque of
1400 N-m. The diameter of the brake drum is 350 mm and the angle of contact for each shoe is 100°.
If the coefficient of friction between the brake drum and lining is 0.4; find : 1. the spring force

material is not to exceed 0.3 N/mm2.

Solution. Given : TB = 1400 N-m = 1400 × 103 N-mm ; d = 350 mm or r = 175 mm ;
2θ = 100° = 100 × π / 180 = 1.75 rad ; μ = 0.4 ; pb = 0.3 N/mm2
1.  Spring force necessary to set the brake
Let
S = Spring force necessary to set the brake,
RN1 and Ft1 = Normal reaction and the braking force on the right hand side shoe, and

 1400 × 103 = (Ft1 + Ft2) r = (0.776 S + 1.454 S) 175 = 390.25 S

   b  = Width of the brake shoes in mm.

25.9 Simple Band Brake
A band brake consists of a flexible band of leather, one or more ropes, or a steel lined with
friction material, which embraces a part of the circumference of the drum. A band brake, as
shown in Fig. 25.14, is called a simple band brake in which one end of the band is attached to a
fixed pin or fulcrum of the lever while the other end is attached to the lever at a distance b from
the fulcrum.
Contents
Top
936    A Textbook of Machine Design
When a force P is applied to the lever at C, the lever turns about the fulcrum pin O and tightens
the band on the drum and hence the brakes are applied. The friction between the band and the drum
provides the braking force. The force P on the lever at C may be determined as discussed below :
Fig. 25.14. Simple band brake.
Let
T1 = Tension in the tight side of the band,
T2 = Tension in the slack side of the band,
θ = Angle of lap (or embrace) of the band on the drum,
μ = Coefficient of friction between the band and the drum,
r = Radius of the drum,
t = Thickness of the band, and
re = Effective radius of the drum = r + t / 2.
We know that limiting ratio of the tensions is given by the relation,

and braking force on the drum
= T1 – T2
∴  Braking torque on the drum,
TB = (T1 – T2) r
...(Neglecting thickness of band)
= (T1 – T2) re
...(Considering thickness of band)
Now considering the equilibrium of the lever OBC. It may be noted that when the drum rotates
in the clockwise direction as shown in Fig. 25.14 (a), the end of the band attached to the fulcrum O
will be slack with tension T2 and end of the band attached to B will be tight with tension T1. On the
other hand, when the drum rotates in the anticlockwise direction as shown in Fig. 25.14 (b), the
tensions in the band will reverse, i.e. the end of the band attached to the fulcrum O will be tight with
tension T1 and the end of the band attached to B will be slack with tension T2. Now taking moments
about the fulcrum O, we have
P.l = T1.b
...(for clockwise rotation of the drum)
and
P.l = T2.b
...(for anticlockwise rotation of the drum)

where
l = Length of the lever from the fulcrum (OC), and
b = Perpendicular distance from O to the line of action of T1 or T2.
Notes: 1. When the brake band is attached to the lever, as shown in Fig. 25.14 (a) and (b), then the force (P)
must act in the upward direction in order to tighten the band on the drum.
2. Sometimes the brake band is attached to the lever as shown in Fig. 25.15 (a) and (b), then the force (P)
must act in the downward direction in order to tighten the band. In this case, for clockwise rotation of the drum,
the end of the band attached to the fulcrum O will be tight with tension T1 and band of the band attached to B will
be slack with tension T2. The tensions T1 and T2 will reverse for anticlockwise rotation of the drum.
Fig. 25.15. Simple band brake.
3. If the permissible tensile stress (σt) for the material of the band is known, then maximum tension in
the band is given by
T1 = σt × w × t
where
w = Width of the band, and
t = Thickness of the band.
4. The width of band (w) should not exceed 150 mm for drum diameter (d ) greater than 1 metre and
100 mm for drum diameter less than 1 metre. The band thickness (t) may also be obtained by using the  empirical
relation i.e. t = 0.005 d
For brakes of hand operated winches, the steel bands of the following sizes are usually used :

Example 25.8. A simple band brake operates on a drum of 600 mm in diameter that is
running at 200 r.p.m. The coefficient of friction is 0.25. The brake band has a contact of 270°, one
end is fastened to a fixed pin and the other end to the brake arm 125 mm from the fixed pin. The
straight brake arm is 750 mm long and placed perpendicular to the diameter that bisects the angle
of contact.
(a) What is the pull necessary on the end of the brake arm to stop the wheel if 35 kW is being
absorbed ? What is the direction for this minimum pull ?
(b) What width of steel band of 2.5 mm thick is required for this brake if the maximum tensile
stress is not to exceed 50 MPa ?
Solution. Given : d = 600 mm or r = 300 mm ; N = 200 r.p.m. ; μ = 0.25 ; θ = 270°
= 270 × π/180 = 4.713 rad ; Power = 35 kW = 35 × 103 W ; t = 2.5 mm ; σt = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2

The simple band brake is shown in Fig. 25.16.
Since one end of the band is attached to the fixed pin
O, therefore the pull P on the end of the brake arm will
act upward and when the wheel rotates anticlockwise,
the end of the band attached to O will be tight with tension
T1 and the end of the band attached to B will be slack
with tension T2. First of all, let us find the tensions

Example 25.9. A band brake acts on the 
3
4 th  of circumference of a drum of 450 mm diameter
which is keyed to the shaft. The band brake provides a braking torque of 225 N-m. One end of the
band is attached to a fulcrum pin of the lever and the other end to a pin 100 mm from the fulcrum. If
the operating force applied at 500 mm from the fulcrum and the coefficient of friction is 0.25, find the
operating force when the drum rotates in the anticlockwise direction.
 If the brake lever and pins are to be made of mild steel having permissible stresses for tension
and crushing as 70 MPa and for shear 56 MPa, design the shaft, key, lever and pins. The bearing
pressure between the pin and the lever may be taken as 8 N/mm2.
Solution. Given  : d = 450 mm or r = 225 mm ; TB = 225 N-m = 225 × 103 N-mm ; OB = 100

The band brake is shown in Fig. 25.17. Since one end of the band is attached to the fulcrum at

of the band attached to O will be tight with tension T1 and the end of the band attached to B will be
slack with tension T2. First of all, let us find the tensions T1 and T2.

From equations (i) and (ii), we have

Taking moments about the fulcrum O, we have
P × 500 = T2 × 100 = 444 × 100 = 44 400
∴
P = 44 400 / 500 = 88.8 N Ans.

Design of pins
Let

...(Assume)
The pins at O and B are designed for the maximum tension in the band (i.e. T1 = 1444 N),
Considering bearing of the pins at O and B, we have maximum tension (T1),
1444 = d1.l1.pb = d1 × 1.25 d1 × 8 = 10 (d1)2
∴
(d1)2 = 1444 / 10 = 144.4    or    d1 = 12 mm Ans.
and
l1 = 1.25 d1 = 1.25 × 12 = 15 mm Ans.
Let us now check the pin for induced shearing stress. Since the pin is in double shear, therefore

25.10 Differential Band Brake
In a differential band brake, as shown in Fig. 25.19, the ends of the band are joined at A and B
to a lever AOC pivoted on a fixed pin or fulcrum O. It may be noted that for the band to tighten, the
length OA must be greater than the length OB.
Fig. 25.19. Differenctial band brake.
The braking torque on the drum may be obtained in the similar way as discussed in simple band
brake. Now considering the equilibrium of the lever AOC. It may be noted that when the drum rotates
in the clockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 25.19 (a), the end of the band attached to A will be slack
with tension T2 and end of the band attached to B will be tight with tension T1. On the other hand,
when the drum rotates in the anticlockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 25.19 (b), the end of the band
attached to A will be tight with tension T1 and end of the band attached to B will be slack with tension
T2. Now taking moments about the fulcrum O, we have

or
P.l = T2.a – T1.b
...(i)
and
P.l + T2.b = T1.a
...(for anticlockwise rotation of the drum)
or
P.l = T1.a – T2.b
...(ii)
We have discussed in block brakes (Art. 25.6), that when the frictional force helps to apply the
brake, it is said to be self energizing brake. In case of differential band brake, we see from equations
(i) and (ii) that the moment T1.b and T2.b helps in applying the brake (because it adds to the moment
P.l) for the clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of the drum respectively.
We have also discussed that when the force P is negative or zero, then brake is self locking. Thus
for differential band brake and for clockwise rotation of the drum, the condition for self- locking is
T2.a ≤T1.b
      or
T2/T1 ≤ b / a
and for anticlockwise rotation of the drum, the condition for self-locking is
T1.a ≤T2.b
     or
T1/T2 ≤ b / a
Notes: 1. The condition for self-locking may also be written as follows. For clockwise rotation of the drum,
T1.b ≥T2.a
     or
T1/T2 ≥ a / b
and for anticlockwise rotation of the drum,
T2.b ≥T1.a
    or
T2/T1 ≥ a/b
2. When in Fig. 25.19 (a) and (b), the length OB is greater than OA, then the force P must act in the
upward direction in order to apply the brake. The tensions in the band, i.e. T1 and T2 will remain unchanged.
3. Sometimes, the band brake is attached to the lever as shown in Fig. 25.20 (a) and (b). In such cases,
when OA is greater than OB, the force (P) must act upwards. When the drum rotates in the clockwise direction,
the end of the band attached to A will be tight with tension T1 and the end of the band attached to B will be slack
with tension T2, as shown in Fig. 25.20 (a). When the drum rotates in the anticlockwise direction, the end of the
band attached to A will be slack with tension T2 and the end of the band attached to B will be tight with tension
T1, as shown in Fig. 25.20 (b).
Fig. 25.20. Differential band brake.
4. When in Fig. 25.20 (a) and (b), the length OB is greater than OA, then the force (P) must act downward
in order to apply the brake. The position of tensions T1 and T2 will remain unchanged.
Example 25.10. A differential band brake, as shown in Fig. 25.21, has an angle of contact of
225°. The band has a compressed woven lining and bears against a cast iron drum of 350 mm
diameter. The brake is to sustain a torque of 350 N-m and the coefficient of friction between the band
and the drum is 0.3. Find : 1. the necessary force (P) for the clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of
the drum; and 2. The value of ‘OA’ for the brake to be self locking, when the drum rotates clockwise.

From equations (i) and (ii), we find that
T1 = 2886.5 N ; and T2 = 886.5 N
Now taking moments about the fulcrum O, we have
P × 500 = T2 × 150 – T1 × 35
or
P × 500 = 886.5 × 150 – 2886.5 × 35 = 31 947.5
∴
P = 31 947.5 / 500 = 64 N Ans.
When the drum rotates in the anticlockwise
direction, the end of the band attached to A will be tight
with tension T1 and end of the band attached to B will
be slack with tension T2, as shown in Fig. 25.23. Taking
moments about the fulcrum O, we have
P × 500 = T1 × 150 – T2 × 35
or
P × 500 = 2886.5 × 150 – 886.5 × 35

2. Valve of ‘OA’ for the brake to be self locking, when
the drum rotates clockwise
The clockwise rotation of the drum is shown in Fig. 25.22.
For clockwise rotation of the drum, we know that
P × 500 + T1 × OB = T2 × OA

TB = Torque applied to the drum = 450 N-m
...(Given)
In a differential band brake, when OB is greater than OA and the clockwise torque (TB) is
applied to the drum, then the maximum force (T1) will be in the band attached to A and the minimum
force (T2) will be in the band attached to B, as shown in Fig. 25.26.
We know that braking torque (TB),
450 = (T1 – T2) r = (T1 – T2) 0.075
∴
T1 – T2 = 450 / 0.075 = 6000 N

44 000 + 50 T2 + 300 000 = T2 × 100

∴
T2 = 44 000 / 302 = 146 N

Example 25.13. A differential band brake is
operated by a lever of length 500 mm. The brake drum
has a diameter of 500 mm and the maximum torque
on the drum is 1000 N-m. The band brake embraces
2/3rd of the circumference. One end of the band is
attached to a pin 100 mm from the fulcrum and the
other end to another pin 80 mm from the fulcrum and
on the other side of it when the operating force is also
acting. If the band brake is lined with asbestos fabric
having a coefficient of friction 0.3, find the operating
force required.
Design the steel band, shaft, key, lever and
fulcrum pin. The permissible stresses may be taken
as 70 MPa in tension, 50 MPa in shear and 20 MPa
in bearing. The bearing pressure for the brake lining should not exceed 0.2 N/mm2.
Solution. Given : l = 500 mm ; d = 500 mm or r = 250 mm ; TB = 1000 N-m = 1 × 106 N-mm ;
OA = 100 mm ; OB = 80 mm ; μ = 0.3 ; σt = 70 MPa = 70 N/mm2  ; τ = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2 ;
σb = 20 MPa = 20 N/mm2 ; pb = 0.2 N/mm2
Operating force
Let
P = Operating force
The differential band brake is shown in Fig. 25.28. Since OA > OB, therefore the operating
force (P) will act downward. When the drum rotates anticlockwise, the end of the band attached to A
will be tight with tension T1 and the end of the band attached to B will be slack with tension T2. First
of all, let us find the values of tensions T1 and T2.

We know that the braking torque (TB),

∴
T1 – T2 = 1 × 106 / 250 = 4000 N       ...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we have
T1 = 5587 N,  and  T2 = 1587 N
Now taking moments about the fulcrum O, we have
P × 500 = T1 × 100 – T2 × 80
= 5587 × 100 – 1587 × 80
= 431 740
∴
P = 431 740 / 500 = 863.5 N Ans.

∴
b = 13 333/209.4 = 63.7 say 64 mm Ans.
and cross-sectional area of the band,
A = b × t = 64 t mm2
∴Tensile strength of the band
= A × σt = 64 t × 70 = 4480 t N
Since the band has to withstand a maximum tension (T1) equal to 5587 N, therefore
4480 t = 5587 or
t = 5587 / 4480 = 1.25 mm Ans.
Design of shaft

Since the shaft has to transmit torque equal to the braking torque (TB), therefore

vertical and horizontal components, as shown in Fig. 25.30.

and

fore, diameter of hole in the lever

The boss is made at the pin joints whose outer diameter
is taken equal to twice the diameter of pin and length equal to

∴Outer diameter of boss

Let us now check the induced bending stress in the lever
at the fulcrum. The section of the lever at the fulcrum is shown

25.11 Band and Block Brake
The band brake may be lined with blocks of wood or other material, as shown in Fig. 25.33 (a).
The friction between the blocks and the drum provides braking action. Let there are ‘n’ number of
blocks, each subtending an angle 2 θ at the centre and the drum rotates in anticlockwise direction.
Fig. 25.33. Band and block brake.
Let
T1 = Tension in the tight side,
T2 = Tension in the slack side,
μ = Coefficient of friction between the blocks and drum,
T1' = Tension in the band between the first and second block,
T2', T3' etc. = Tensions in the band between the second and third block, between the
third and fourth block etc.
Consider one of the blocks (say first block) as shown in Fig. 25.33 (b). This is in equilibrium
under the action of the following forces :
1. Tension in the tight side (T1),
2. Tension in the slack side (T1') or tension in the band between the first and second block,
3. Normal reaction of the drum on the block (RN), and
4. The force of friction (μ.RN).

the tension in the tight side is T1' and in the slack side is T2'. Similarly for the third block, the tension in the tight
side is T2' and in the slack side is T3' and so on. For the last block, the tension in the tight side is Tn – 1 and in the
slack side is T2.

shown in Fig. 25.34, the band is lined with 12 blocks
each of which subtends an angle of 15° at the centre
of the rotating drum. The thickness of the blocks is
75 mm and the diameter of the drum is 850 mm. If,

Since OA > OB, therefore the force at C must act down-
ward. Also, the drum rotates clockwise, therefore the end of
the band attached to A will be slack with tension T2 (least
tension) and the end of the band attached to B will be tight
with tension T1 (greatest tension).
Consider one of the blocks (say first block) as shown is
Fig. 25.35. This is in equilibrium under the action of the fol-
lowing four forces :
1. Tension in the tight side (T1),
2. Tension in the slack side (T1') or the tension in the
band between the first and second block,
3. Normal reaction of the drum on the block (RN), and
4. The force of friction (μ.RN).

25.12 Internal Expanding Brake
An internal expanding brake consists of two shoes S1 and S2 as shown in Fig. 25.36 (a). The
outer surface of the shoes are lined with some friction material (usually with Ferodo) to increase the
coefficient of friction and to prevent wearing away of the metal. Each shoe is pivoted at one end about
a fixed fulcrum O1 and O2 and made to contact a cam at the other end. When the cam rotates, the
shoes are pushed outwards against the rim of the drum. The friction between the shoes and the drum
produces the braking torque and hence reduces the speed of the drum. The shoes are normally held in
off position by a spring as shown in Fig. 25.36 (a). The drum encloses the entire mechanism to keep
out dust and moisture. This type of brake is commonly used in motor cars and light trucks.
Fig. 25.36
We shall now consider the forces acting on such a brake, when the drum rotates in the
anticlockwise direction as shown in Fig. 25.36 (b). It may be noted that for the anticlockwise direction,
the left hand shoe is known as leading or primary shoe while the right hand shoe is known as trailing
or secondary shoe.
Let
r = Internal radius of the wheel rim.
b = Width of the brake lining.
p1 = Maximum intensity of normal pressure,
pN = Normal pressure,
F1 = Force exerted by the cam on the leading shoe, and
F2 = Force exerted by the cam on the trailing shoe.

Consider a small element of the
brake lining AC subtending an angle δθ
at the centre. Let OA makes an angle θ
with OO1 as shown in Fig. 25.36 (b). It
is assumed that the pressure distribu-
tion on the shoe is nearly uniform, how-
ever the friction lining wears out more
at the free end. Since the shoe turns
about O1, therefore the rate of wear of
the shoe lining at A will be proportional
to the radial displacement of that point.
The rate of wear of the shoe lining var-
ies directly as the perpendicular dis-
tance from O1 to OA, i.e. O1B. From
the geometry of the figure,
O1B = OO1 sin θ
and normal pressure at A,  pN ∝ sin θ  or
pN = p1 sin θ
∴Normal force acting on the element,
δRN = Normal pressure × Area of the element
= pN (b . r . δθ) = p1 sin θ (b . r . δθ)
and braking or friction force on the element,
δF = μ.δRN = μ p1 sin θ (b . r . δθ)
∴Braking torque due to the element about O,
δTB = δF . r = μ p1 sin θ (b . r . δθ) r = μ p1 b r2 (sin θ.δθ)

Now for leading shoe, taking moments about the fulcrum O1,
F1 × l = MN – MF
and for trailing shoe, taking moments about the fulcrum O2,
F2 × l = MN + MF
Note: If MF > MN, then the brake becomes self locking.
Example 25.15. Fig. 25.37 shows the arrangement of two brake shoes which act on the internal
surface of a cylindrical brake drum. The braking force F1 and F2 are applied as shown and each
shoe pivots on its fulcrum O1 and O2. The width of the brake lining is 35 mm. The intensity of
pressure at any point A is 0.4 sin θ N/mm2, where θ is measured as shown from either pivot. The
coefficient of friction is 0.4. Determine the braking torque and the magnitude of the forces F1 and F2.

Solution. Given : b = 35 mm ; μ = 0.4 ; r = 150 mm ; l = 200 mm ; θ1 = 25° ; θ2 = 125°
Since the intensity of normal pressure at any point is 0.4 sin θ N/mm2, therefore maximum
intensity of normal pressure,
 p1
= 0.4 N/mm2
We know that the braking torque for one shoe,
= μ . p1 . b . r2 (cos θ1 – cos θ2)
= 0.4 × 0.4 × 35 (150)2 (cos 25° – cos 125°)
= 126 000 (0.9063 + 0.5736) = 186 470 N-mm
∴ Total braking torque for two shoes,

= 2 × 186 470 = 372 940 N-mm

26.1 Introduction
A bearing is a machine element which support another
moving machine element (known as journal). It permits a
relative motion between the contact surfaces of the
members, while carrying the load. A little consideration
will show that due to the relative motion between the contact
surfaces, a certain amount of power is wasted in overcoming
frictional resistance and if the rubbing surfaces are in direct
contact, there will be rapid wear. In order to reduce frictional
resistance and wear and in some cases to carry away the
heat generated, a layer of fluid (known as lubricant) may
be provided. The lubricant used to separate the journal and
bearing is usually a mineral oil refined from petroleum, but
vegetable oils, silicon oils, greases etc., may be used.
26.2 Classification of Bearings
Though the bearings may be classified in many ways,
yet the following are important from the subject point of
view:
Contents
Top
Sliding Contact Bearings      963
1. Depending upon the direction of load to be supported. The bearings under this group are
classified as:
(a) Radial bearings, and (b) Thrust bearings.
In radial bearings, the load acts perpendicular to the direction of motion of the moving element
as shown in Fig. 26.1 (a) and (b).
In thrust bearings, the load acts along the axis of rotation as shown in Fig. 26.1 (c).
Note : These bearings may move in either of the directions as shown in Fig. 26.1.
Fig. 26.1. Radial and thrust bearings.
2. Depending upon the nature of contact. The bearings under this group are classified as :
(a) Sliding contact bearings, and (b) Rolling contact bearings.
In sliding contact bearings, as shown in Fig. 26.2 (a), the sliding takes place along the surfaces
of contact between the moving element and the fixed element. The sliding contact bearings are also
known as plain bearings.

In rolling contact bearings, as shown in Fig. 26.2 (b), the steel balls or rollers, are interposed
between the moving and fixed elements. The balls offer rolling friction at two points for each ball or
roller.
26.3 Types of Sliding Contact Bearings
The sliding contact bearings in which the sliding action is guided in a straight line and carrying
radial loads, as shown in Fig. 26.1 (a), may be called slipper or guide bearings. Such type of bearings
are usually found in cross-head of steam engines.

Fig. 26.3. Journal or sleeve bearings.
The sliding contact bearings in which the sliding action is along the circumference of a circle or
an arc of a circle and carrying radial loads are known as journal or sleeve bearings. When the angle
of contact of the bearing with the journal is 360° as shown in Fig. 26.3 (a), then the bearing is called
a full journal bearing. This type of bearing is commonly used in industrial machinery to accommodate
bearing loads in any radial direction.
When the angle of contact of the bearing with the journal is 120°, as shown in Fig. 26.3 (b), then
the bearing is said to be partial journal bearing. This type of bearing has less friction than full
journal bearing, but it can be used only where the load is always in one direction. The most common
application of the partial journal bearings is found in rail road car axles. The full and partial journal
bearings may be called as clearance bearings because the diameter of the journal is less than that of
bearing.

Top
Sliding Contact Bearings      965
When a partial journal bearing has no clearance i.e. the diameters of the journal and bearing are
equal, then the bearing is called a fitted bearing, as shown in Fig. 26.3 (c).
The sliding contact bearings, according to the thickness of layer of the lubricant between the
bearing and the journal, may also be classified as follows :
1.
Thick film bearings. The thick film bearings are those in which the working surfaces are
completely separated from each other by the lubricant. Such type of bearings are also called
as hydrodynamic lubricated bearings.
2.
Thin film bearings. The thin film bearings are those in which, although lubricant is present,
the working surfaces partially contact each other atleast part of the time. Such type of bearings
are also called boundary lubricated bearings.
3.
Zero film bearings. The zero film bearings are those which operate without any lubricant
present.
4.
Hydrostatic or externally pressurized lubricated bearings. The hydrostatic bearings are those
which can support steady loads without any relative motion between the journal and the bearing.
This is achieved by forcing externally pressurized lubricant between the members.
26.4 Hydrodynamic Lubricated Bearings
We have already discussed that in hydrodynamic
lubricated bearings, there is a thick film of lubricant
between the journal and the bearing. A little
consideration will show that when the bearing is
supplied with sufficient lubricant, a pressure is build
up in the clearance space when the journal is rotating
about an axis that is eccentric with the bearing axis.
The load can be supported by this fluid pressure without
any actual contact between the journal and bearing.
The load carrying ability of a hydrodynamic bearing
arises simply because a viscous fluid resists being
pushed around. Under the proper conditions, this
resistance to motion will develop a pressure distribution
in the lubricant film that can support a useful load. The load supporting pressure in hydrodynamic
bearings arises from either
1.
the flow of a viscous fluid in a converging channel (known as wedge film lubrication), or
2.
the resistance of a viscous fluid to being squeezed out from between approaching surfaces
(known as squeeze film lubrication).
26.5 Assumptions in Hydrodynamic Lubricated Bearings
The following are the basic assumptions used in the theory of hydrodynamic lubricated
bearings:
1.
The lubricant obeys Newton's law of viscous flow.
2.
The pressure is assumed to be constant throughout the film thickness.
3.
The lubricant is assumed to be incompressible.
4.
The viscosity is assumed to be constant throughout the film.
5.
The flow is one dimensional, i.e. the side leakage is neglected.
26.6 Important Factors for the Formation of Thick Oil Film in Hydrodynamic
Lubricated Bearings
According to Reynolds, the following factors are essential for the formation of a thick film of
Hydrodynamic Lubricated Bearings
Contents
Top
966    A Textbook of Machine Design
oil in hydrodynamic lubricated bearings :
1.
A continuous supply of oil.
2.
A relative motion between the two surfaces in a direction approximately tangential to the
surfaces.
3.
The ability of one of the surfaces to take up a small inclination to the other surface in the
direction of the relative motion.
4.
The line of action of resultant oil pressure must coincide with the line of action of the
external load between the surfaces.
26.7 Wedge Film Journal Bearings
The load carrying ability of a wedge-film journal bearing results when the journal and/or the
bearing rotates relative to the load. The most common case is that of a steady load, a fixed (non-
rotating) bearing and a rotating journal. Fig. 26.4 (a) shows a journal at rest with metal to metal
contact at A on the line of action of the supported load. When the journal rotates slowly in the
anticlockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 26.4 (b), the point of contact will move to B, so that the
angle AOB is the angle of sliding friction of the surfaces in contact at B. In the absence of a lubricant,
there will be dry metal to metal friction. If a lubricant is present in the clearance space of the bearing
and journal, then a thin absorbed film of the lubricant may partly separate the surface, but a continuous
fluid film completely separating the surfaces will not exist because of slow speed.
Fig. 26.4. Wedge film journal bearing.
When the speed of the journal is increased, a continuous fluid film is established as in Fig. 26.4
(c). The centre of the journal has moved so that the minimum film thickness is at C. It may be noted
that from D to C in the direction of motion, the film is continually narrowing and hence is a converging
film. The curved converging film may be considered as a wedge shaped film of a slipper bearing
wrapped around the journal. A little consideration will show that from C to D in the direction of
rotation, as shown in Fig. 26.4 (c), the film is diverging and cannot give rise to a positive pressure or
a supporting action.

Fig. 26.5 shows the two views of the bearing shown in Fig. 26.4 (c), with the variation of
pressure in the converging film. Actually, because of side leakage, the angle of contact on which
pressure acts is less than 180°.
26.8 Squeeze Film Journal Bearing
We have seen in the previous article that in a wedge film journal bearing, the bearing carries a
steady load and the journal rotates relative to the bearing. But in certain cases, the bearings oscillate
or rotate so slowly that the wedge film cannot provide a satisfactory film thickness. If the load is
uniform or varying in magnitude while acting in a constant direction, this becomes a thin film or
possibly a zero film problem. But if the load reverses its direction, the squeeze film may develop
sufficient capacity to carry the dynamic loads without contact between the journal and the bearing.
Such bearings are known as squeeze film journal bearing.
26.9 Properties of Sliding Contact Bearing Materials
When the journal and the bearings are having proper lubrication i.e. there is a film of clean,
non-corrosive lubricant in between, separating the two surfaces in contact, the only requirement of
the bearing material is that they should have sufficient strength and rigidity. However, the conditions
under which bearings must operate in service are generally far from ideal and thus the other properties
as discussed below must be considered in selecting the best material.
1. Compressive strength. The maximum bearing pressure is considerably greater than the average
pressure obtained by dividing the load to the projected area. Therefore the bearing material should
have high compressive strength to withstand this maximum pressure so as to prevent extrusion or
other permanent deformation of the bearing.
2. Fatigue strength. The bearing material should have sufficient fatigue strength so that it can
withstand repeated loads without developing surface fatigue cracks. It is of major importance in
aircraft and automotive engines.
3. Comformability. It is the ability of the bearing material to accommodate shaft deflections
and bearing inaccuracies by plastic deformation (or creep) without excessive wear and heating.
4. Embeddability. It is the ability of bearing material to accommodate (or embed) small particles
of dust, grit etc., without scoring the material of the journal.
5. Bondability. Many high capacity bearings are made by bonding one or more thin layers of a
bearing material to a high strength steel shell. Thus, the strength of the bond i.e. bondability is an
important consideration in selecting bearing material.

6. Corrosion resistance. The bearing material
should not corrode away under the action of lubricating
oil. This property is of particular importance in internal-
combustion engines where the same oil is used to
lubricate the cylinder walls and bearings. In the cylinder,
the lubricating oil comes into contact with hot cylinder
walls and may oxidise and collect carbon deposits from
the walls.
7. Thermal conductivity. The bearing material
should be of high thermal conductivity so as to permit
the rapid removal of the heat generated by friction.
8. Thermal expansion. The bearing material
should be of low coefficient of thermal expansion, so
that when the bearing operates over a wide range of
temperature, there is no undue change in the clearance.
All these properties as discussed above are, how-
ever, difficult to find in any particular bearing material.
The various materials are used in practice, depending
upon the requirement of the actual service conditions.
The choice of material for any application must represent a compromise. The following table shows
the comparison of some of the properties of more common metallic bearing materials.

26.10 Materials used for Sliding Contact Bearings
The materials commonly used for sliding contact bearings are discussed below :
1. Babbit metal. The tin base and lead base babbits are widely used as a bearing material,
because they satisfy most requirements for general applications. The babbits are recommended where
the maximum bearing pressure (on projected area) is not over 7 to 14 N/mm2. When applied in
Marine bearings
Contents
Top
Sliding Contact Bearings      969
automobiles, the babbit is generally used as a thin layer, 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm thick, bonded to an
insert or steel shell. The composition of the babbit metals is as follows :
Tin base babbits :
Tin 90% ; Copper 4.5% ; Antimony 5% ; Lead 0.5%.
Lead base babbits : Lead 84% ; Tin 6% ; Anitmony 9.5% ; Copper 0.5%.
2. Bronzes. The bronzes (alloys of copper, tin and zinc) are generally used in the form of
machined bushes pressed into the shell. The bush may be in one or two pieces. The bronzes commonly
used for bearing material are gun metal and phosphor bronzes.
The gun metal (Copper 88% ; Tin 10% ; Zinc 2%) is used for high grade bearings subjected to
high pressures (not more than 10 N/mm2 of projected area) and high speeds.
The phosphor bronze (Copper 80% ; Tin 10% ; Lead 9% ; Phosphorus 1%) is used for bearings
subjected to very high pressures (not more than 14 N/mm2 of projected area) and speeds.
3. Cast iron. The cast iron bearings are usually used with steel journals. Such type of bearings
are fairly successful where lubrication is adequate and the pressure is limited to 3.5 N/mm2 and speed
to 40 metres per minute.
4. Silver. The silver and silver lead bearings are mostly used in aircraft engines where the
fatigue strength is the most important consideration.
5. Non-metallic bearings. The various non-metallic bearings are made of carbon-graphite, rubber,
wood and plastics. The carbon-graphite bearings are self lubricating, dimensionally stable over a
wide range of operating conditions, chemically inert and can operate at higher temperatures than
other bearings. Such type of bearings are used in food processing and other equipment where
contamination by oil or grease must be prohibited. These bearings are also used in applications where
the shaft speed is too low to maintain a hydrodynamic oil film.
The soft rubber bearings are used with water or other low viscosity lubricants, particularly
where sand or other large particles are present. In addition to the high degree of embeddability and
comformability, the rubber bearings are excellent for absorbing shock loads and vibrations. The
rubber bearings are used mainly on marine propeller shafts, hydraulic turbines and pumps.
The wood bearings are used in many applications where low cost, cleanliness, inattention to
lubrication and anti-seizing are important.

The commonly used plastic material for bearings is Nylon and Teflon. These materials have
many characteristics desirable in bearing materials and both can be used dry i.e. as a zero film bearing.
The Nylon is stronger, harder and more resistant to abrasive wear. It is used for applications in which
these properties are important e.g. elevator bearings, cams in telephone dials etc. The Teflon is rapidly
replacing Nylon as a wear surface or liner for journal and other sliding bearings because of the
following properties:
1. It has lower coefficient of friction, about 0.04 (dry) as compared to 0.15 for Nylon.
2. It can be used at higher temperatures up to about 315°C as compared to 120°C for Nylon.
3. It is dimensionally stable because it does not absorb moisture, and
4. It is practically chemically inert.
26.11 Lubricants
The lubricants are used in bearings to reduce friction between the rubbing surfaces and to carry
away the heat generated by friction. It also protects the bearing against corrosion. All lubricants are
classified into the following three groups :
1. Liquid, 2. Semi-liquid, and 3. Solid.
The liquid lubricants usually used in
bearings are mineral oils and synthetic oils.
The mineral oils are most commonly used
because of their cheapness and stability.
The liquid lubricants are usually preferred
where they may be retained.
A grease is a  semi-liquid lubricant
having higher viscosity than oils. The
greases are employed where slow speed and
heavy pressure exist and where oil drip from
the bearing is undesirable. The solid
lubricants are useful in reducing friction
where oil films cannot be maintained
because of pressures or temperatures. They
should be softer than materials being
lubricated. A graphite is the most common
of the solid lubricants either alone or mixed
with oil or grease.
26.12 Properties of Lubricants
1. Viscosity. It is the measure of degree of fluidity of a liquid. It is a physical property by virtue
of which an oil is able to form, retain and offer resistance to shearing a buffer film-under heat and
pressure. The greater the heat and pressure, the greater viscosity is required of a lubricant to prevent
thinning and squeezing out of the film.
The fundamental meaning of viscosity may be understood by considering a flat plate moving
under a force P parallel to a stationary plate, the two plates being separated by a thin film of a fluid
lubricant of thickness h, as shown in Fig. 26.6. The particles of the lubricant adhere strongly to the
moving and stationary plates. The motion is accompanied by a linear slip or shear between the particles
throughout the entire height (h) of the film thickness. If A is the area of the plate in contact with the
lubricant, then the unit shear stress is given by
τ = P / A
Wherever moving and rotating parts are present
proper lubrication is essential to protect the moving
parts from wear and tear and reduce friction.
Contents
Top
Sliding Contact Bearings      971
According to Newton's law of viscous flow, the magnitude of this shear stress varies directly
with the velocity gradient (dV / dy). It is assumed that
(a) the lubricant completely fills the space between the two surfaces,
(b) the velocity of the lubricant at each surface is same as that of the surface, and
(c) any flow of the lubricant perpendicular to the velocity of the plate is negligible.

... (Q 1 N = 1 kg-m / s2)
Thus the unit of absolute viscosity in S.I. units is kg / m-s.
The viscocity of the lubricant is measured by Saybolt universal viscometer. It determines the
time required for a standard volume of oil at a certain temperature to flow under a certain head
through a tube of standard diameter and length. The time so determined in seconds is the Saybolt
universal viscosity. In order to convert Saybolt universal viscosity in seconds to absolute viscosity (in
kg / m-s), the following formula may be used:

where
Z = Absolute viscosity at temperature t in kg / m-s, and
S = Saybolt universal viscosity in seconds.
The variation of absolute viscosity with temperature for commonly used lubricating oils is
shown in Table 26.2 on the next page.
2. Oiliness. It is a joint property of the lubricant and the bearing surfaces in contact. It is a
measure of the lubricating qualities under boundary conditions where base metal to metal is prevented
only by absorbed film. There is no absolute measure of oiliness.

3. Density. This property has no relation to lubricating value but is useful in changing the
kinematic viscosity to absolute viscosity. Mathematically
Absolute viscosity = ρ × Kinematic viscosity (in m2/s)
where
ρ = Density of the lubricating oil.
The density of most of the oils at 15.5°C varies from 860 to 950 kg / m3 (the average value may
be taken as 900 kg / m3 ). The density at any other temperature (t) may be obtained from the following
relation, i.e.
ρt = ρ15.5 – 0.000 657 t
where
ρ15.5 = Density of oil at 15.5° C.
4. Viscosity index. The term viscosity index is used to denote the degree of variation of viscosity
with temperature.
5. Flash point. It is the lowest temperature at which an oil gives off sufficient vapour to support
a momentary flash without actually setting fire to the oil when a flame is brought within 6 mm at the
surface of the oil.
6. Fire point.  It is the temperature at which an oil gives off sufficient vapour to burn it
continuously when ignited.
7. Pour point or freezing point. It is the temperature at which an oil will cease to flow when
cooled.
26.13 Terms used in Hydrodynamic Journal Bearing
A hydrodynamic journal bearing is shown in Fig. 26.7, in which O is the centre of the journal
and O′ is the centre of the bearing.
Let
 D = Diameter of the bearing,
d = Diameter of the journal,
and
l = Length of the bearing.
The following terms used in hydrodynamic journal
bearing are important from the subject point of view :
1. Diametral clearance. It the difference between the
diameters of the bearing and the journal. Mathematically,
diametral clearance,
c = D – d
Note : The diametral clearance (c) in a bearing should be small
enough to produce the necessary velocity gradient, so that the pressure built up will support the load. Also the
small clearance has the advantage of decreasing side leakage. However, the allowance must be made for manu-
facturing tolerances in the journal and bushing. A commonly used clearance in industrial machines is 0.025 mm
per cm of journal diameter.
2. Radial clearance. It is the difference between the radii of the bearing and the journal.

4. Eccentricity. It is the radial distance between the centre (O) of the bearing and the displaced
centre (O′) of the bearing under load. It is denoted by e.
5. Minimum oil film thickness. It is the minimum distance between the bearing and the journal,
under complete lubrication condition. It is denoted by h0 and occurs at the line of centres as shown in
Fig. 26.7. Its value may be assumed as c / 4.
6. Attitude or eccentricity ratio. It is the ratio of the eccentricity to the radial clearance.

7. Short and long bearing. If the ratio of the length to the
diameter of the journal (i.e. l / d) is less than 1, then the bearing is
said to be short bearing. On the other hand, if l / d is greater than
1, then the bearing is known as long bearing.
Notes : 1.  When the length of the journal (l ) is equal to the diameter of
the journal (d ), then the bearing is called square bearing.
2.  Because of the side leakage of the lubricant from the bearing,
the pressure in the film is atmospheric at the ends of the bearing. The
average pressure will be higher for a long bearing than for a short or
square bearing. Therefore, from the stand point of side leakage, a bearing
with a large l / d ratio is preferable. However, space requirements,
manufacturing, tolerances and shaft deflections are better met with a short
bearing. The value of l / d may be taken as 1 to 2 for general industrial
machinery. In crank shaft bearings, the l / d ratio is frequently less than 1.
26.14
Bearing Characteristic Number and Bearing Modulus for
    Journal Bearings
The coefficient of friction in design of bearings is of great importance, because it affords a
means for determining the loss of power due to bearing friction. It has been shown by experiments
that the coefficient of friction for a full lubricated journal bearing is a function of three variables, i.e.
(i)
;
ZN
p
(ii)
;
d
c
and
(iii)
l
d
Therefore the coefficient of friction may be expressed as
μ =

,
ZN

⎛

⎝
⎠
where
μ = Coefficient of friction,
φ = A functional relationship,
Z = Absolute viscosity of the lubricant, in kg / m-s,
N = Speed of the journal in r.p.m.,
p = Bearing pressure on the projected bearing area in N/mm2,
= Load on the journal ÷  l × d
d = Diameter of the journal,
l = Length of the bearing, and
c = Diametral clearance.
The factor ZN / p is termed as bearing characteristic number and is a dimensionless number.
The variation of coefficient of friction with the operating values of bearing characteristic number
(ZN / p) as obtained by McKee brothers (S.A. McKee and T.R. McKee) in an actual test of friction is
shown in Fig. 26.8. The factor ZN/p helps to predict the performance of a bearing.

Sliding Contact Bearings      975
The part of the curve PQ
represents the region of thick film
lubrication. Between Q and R, the
viscosity (Z) or the speed (N) are
so low, or the pressure ( p) is so
great that their combination ZN / p
will reduce the film thickness so that
partial metal to metal contact will
result. The thin film or boundary
lubrication or imperfect lubrication
exists between R and S on the curve.
This is the region where the
viscosity of the lubricant ceases to
be a measure of friction
characteristics but the oiliness of the
lubricant is effective in preventing
complete metal to metal contact and
seizure of the parts.
It may be noted that the part
PQ of the curve represents stable
operating conditions, since from
any point of stability, a decrease in viscosity (Z) will reduce ZN / p. This will result in a decrease in
coefficient of friction (μ) followed by a lowering of bearing temperature that will raise the viscosity
(Z ).
From Fig. 26.8, we see that the minimum amount of friction occurs at A and at this point the
value of ZN / p is known as bearing modulus which is denoted by K. The bearing should not be
operated at this value of bearing modulus, because
a slight decrease in speed or slight increase in
pressure will break the oil film and make the journal
to operate with metal to metal contact. This will
result in high friction, wear and heating. In order
to prevent such conditions, the bearing should be
designed for a value of ZN / p at least three times
the minimum value of bearing modulus (K). If the
bearing is subjected to large fluctuations of load
and heavy impacts, the value of ZN / p = 15 K may
be used.
From above, it is concluded that when the
value of ZN / p is greater than K, then the bearing
will operate with thick film lubrication or under
hydrodynamic conditions. On the other hand, when
the value of ZN / p is less than K, then the oil film
will rupture and there is a metal to metal contact.
26.15 Coefficient of Friction for Journal Bearings

26.18 Heat Generated in a Journal Bearing
The heat generated in a bearing is due to the fluid friction and friction of the parts having
relative motion. Mathematically, heat generated in a bearing,
Qg = μ.W.V  N-m/s or J/s or watts
...(i)
where
 μ = Coefficient of friction,
W = Load on the bearing in N,

d N
π
, d is in metres, and
N = Speed of the journal in r.p.m.
After the thermal equilibrium has been reached, heat will be dissipated at the outer surface of
the bearing at the same rate at which it is generated in the oil film. The amount of heat dissipated will
depend upon the temperature difference, size and mass of the radiating surface and on the amount of
air flowing around the bearing. However, for the convenience in bearing design, the actual heat
dissipating area may be expressed in terms of the projected area of the journal.
Heat dissipated by the bearing,
Qd = C.A (tb – ta) J/s or W
... (Q 1 J/s = 1 W)  ...(ii)
where
C = Heat dissipation coefficient in W/m2/°C,
A = Projected area of the bearing in m2 = l × d,
tb = Temperature of the bearing surface in °C, and
ta = Temperature of the surrounding air in °C.
The value of C have been determined experimentally by O. Lasche. The values depend upon the
type of bearing, its ventilation and the temperature difference. The average values of C (in W/m2/°C),
for journal bearings may be taken as follows :
For unventilated bearings (Still air)
= 140 to 420 W/m2/°C
For well ventilated bearings
= 490 to 1400 W/m2/°C
It has been shown by experiments that the temperature of the bearing (tb) is approximately
mid-way between the temperature of the oil film (t0) and the temperature of the outside air (ta). In
other words,
tb – ta = 1
2  (t0 – ta)
Notes : 1. For well designed bearing, the temperature of the oil film should not be more than 60°C, otherwise the
viscosity of the oil decreases rapidly and the operation of the bearing is found to suffer. The temperature of the
oil film is often called as the operating temperature of the bearing.
2. In case the temperature of the oil film is higher, then the bearing is cooled by circulating water through
coils built in the bearing.
3. The mass of the oil to remove the heat generated at the bearing may be obtained by equating the heat
generated to the heat taken away by the oil. We know that the heat taken away by the oil,
Qt = m.S.t J/s or watts
where
m = Mass of the oil in kg / s,
S = Specific heat of the oil. Its value may be taken as 1840 to 2100 J / kg / °C,
t = Difference between outlet and inlet temperature of the oil in °C.
26.19 Design Procedure for Journal Bearing
The following procedure may be adopted in designing journal bearings, when the bearing load,
the diameter and the speed of the shaft are known.

Sliding Contact Bearings      979
1.
 Determine the bearing length by choosing a ratio of
l / d from Table 26.3.
2.
Check the bearing pressure, p = W / l.d from Table
26.3 for probable satisfactory value.
3.
Assume a lubricant from Table 26.2 and its operating
temperature (t0). This temperature should be between
26.5°C and 60°C with 82°C as a maximum for high
temperature installations such as steam turbines.
4.
Determine the operating value of ZN / p for the
assumed bearing temperature and check this value with
corresponding values in Table 26.3, to determine the
possibility of maintaining fluid film operation.
5.
Assume a clearance ratio c / d from Table 26.3.
6.
Determine the coefficient of friction (μ) by using the
relation as discussed in Art. 26.15.
7.
Determine the heat generated by using the relation as discussed in Art. 26.18.
8.
Determine the heat dissipated by using the relation as discussed in Art. 26.18.
9.
Determine the thermal equilibrium to see that the heat dissipated becomes atleast equal to
the heat generated. In case the heat generated is more than the heat dissipated then either the
bearing is redesigned or it is artificially cooled by water.
Example 26.1. Design a journal bearing for a centrifugal pump from the following data :
Load on the journal = 20 000 N; Speed of the journal = 900 r.p.m.; Type of oil is SAE 10, for
which the absolute viscosity at 55°C = 0.017 kg / m-s; Ambient temperature of oil = 15.5°C ; Maximum
bearing pressure for the pump = 1.5 N / mm2.
Calculate also mass of the lubricating oil required for artificial cooling, if rise of temperature
of oil be limited to 10°C. Heat dissipation coefficient = 1232 W/m2/°C.
Solution. Given : W = 20 000 N ; N = 900 r.p.m. ; t0 = 55°C ; Z = 0.017 kg/m-s ; ta = 15.5°C ;
 p = 1.5 N/mm2 ; t = 10°C ; C = 1232 W/m2/°C
The journal bearing is designed as discussed in the following steps :
1. First of all, let us find the length of the journal ( l ). Assume the diameter of the journal ( d )
as 100 mm. From Table 26.3, we find that the ratio of l / d for centrifugal pumps varies from 1 to 2.
Let us take l / d = 1.6.
∴
l = 1.6 d = 1.6 × 100 = 160 mm Ans.
2. We know that bearing pressure,

2  (55°– 15.5°) = 19.75°C
∴
Qd = 1232 × 0.16 × 0.1 × 19.75 = 389.3 W
... (l and d are taken in metres)
We see that the heat generated is greater than the heat dissipated which indicates that the bear-
ing is warming up. Therefore, either the bearing should be redesigned by taking t0 = 63°C or the
bearing should be cooled artificially.
We know that the amount of artificial cooling required
= Heat generated – Heat dissipated = Qg – Qd
= 480.7 – 389.3 = 91.4 W
Mass of lubricating oil required for artificial cooling
Let
 m = Mass of the lubricating oil required for artificial cooling in kg / s.
We know that the heat taken away by the oil,
Qt = m.S.t = m × 1900 × 10 = 19 000 m W
... [Q Specific heat of oil (S) = 1840 to 2100 J/kg/°C]
Equating this to the amount of artificial cooling required, we have
19 000 m = 91.4
∴
m = 91.4 / 19 000 = 0.0048 kg / s = 0.288 kg / min Ans.

Example 26.3. A full journal bearing of 50 mm diameter and 100 mm long has a bearing
pressure of 1.4 N/mm2. The speed of the journal is 900 r.p.m. and the ratio of journal diameter to the
diametral clearance is 1000. The bearing is lubricated with oil whose absolute viscosity at the
operating temperature of 75°C may be taken as 0.011 kg/m-s. The room temperature is 35°C. Find :
1. The amount of artificial cooling required, and 2. The mass of the lubricating oil required, if the

We know that

(75 – 35) = 20°C
Since the value of heat dissipation coefficient (C ) for unventilated bearing varies from 140 to
420 W/m2/°C, therefore let us take
C = 280 W/m2 /° C
We know that heat dissipated,
Qd = C.A (tb – ta ) = C.l.d (tb – ta)
= 280 × 0.05 × 0.1 × 20 = 28 W = 28 J/s
∴ Amount of artificial cooling required

2. Mass of the lubricating oil required
Let
 m = Mass of the lubricating oil required in kg / s.
We know that heat taken away by the oil,
Qt = m.S.t = m × 1850 × 10 = 18 500 m J/s
Since the heat generated at the bearing is taken away by the lubricating oil, therefore equating
Qg = Qt  or  71.5 = 18 500 m
∴
m = 71.5 / 18 500 = 0.003 86 kg / s = 0.23 kg / min Ans.
Example 26.4. A 150 mm diameter shaft supporting a load of 10 kN has a speed of 1500

clearance of the bearing is 0.15 mm and the absolute viscosity of the oil at the operating temperature
is 0.011 kg/m-s, find the power wasted in friction.
Solution. Given : d = 150 mm = 0.15 m ; W = 10 kN = 10 000 N ; N = 1500 r.p.m. ; l = 1.5 d ;
c = 0.15 mm ; Z = 0.011 kg/m-s

26.20 Solid Journal Bearing
A solid bearing, as shown in Fig. 26.9, is the simplest form of journal bearing. It is simply a
block of cast iron with a hole for a shaft providing running fit. The lower portion of the block is
extended to form a base plate or sole with two holes to receive bolts for fastening it to the frame. An
oil hole is drilled at the top for lubrication. The main disadvantages of this bearing are
Fig. 26.9. Solid journal bearing.
Fig. 26.10. Bushed bearing.
1. There is no provision for adjustment in case of wear, and
2. The shaft must be passed into the bearing axially, i.e. endwise.
Since there is no provision for wear adjustment, therefore this type of bearing is used when the
shaft speed is not very high and the shaft carries light loads only.
26.21 Bushed Bearing
A bushed bearing, as shown in Fig. 26.10, is an improved solid bearing in which a bush of brass
or gun metal is provided. The outside of the bush is a driving fit in the hole of the casting whereas the
inside is a running fit for the shaft. When the bush gets worn out, it can be easily replaced. In small
bearings, the frictional force itself holds the bush in position, but for shafts transmitting high power,
grub screws are used for the prevention of rotation and sliding of the bush.

26.22 Split Bearing or Plummer Block
A split-bearing is used for shafts running at high speeds and carrying heavy loads. A split-
bearing, as shown in Fig. 26.11, consists of a cast iron base (also called block or pedestal), gunmetal
or phosphor bronze brasses, bushes or steps made in two-halves and a cast iron cap. The two halves
of the brasses are held together by a cap or cover by means of mild steel bolts and nuts. Sometimes
thin shims are introduced between the cap and the base to provide an adjustment for wear. When the
bottom wears out, one or two shims are removed and then the cap is tightened by means of bolts.

The brasses are provided with collars or flanges on either side in order to prevent its axial
movement. To prevent its rotation along with the shaft, the following four methods are usually used in
practice.
1.
The sungs are provided at the sides as shown in Fig. 26.12 (a).
2.
A sung is provided at the top, which fits inside the cap as shown in Fig. 26.12 (b). The oil
hole is drilled through the sung.
3.
The steps are made rectangular on the outside and they are made to fit inside a corresponding
hole, as shown in Fig. 26.12 (c).
4.
The steps are made octagonal on the outside and they are made to fit inside a corresponding
hole, as shown in Fig. 26.12 (d).
The split bearing must be lubricated properly.
Fig. 26.12. Methods of preventing rotation of brasses.
26.23 Design of Bearing Caps and Bolts
When a split bearing is used, the bearing cap is tightened on the top. The load is usually carried
by the bearing and not the cap, but in some cases e.g. split connecting rod ends in double acting steam
engines, a considerable load comes on the cap of the bearing. Therefore, the cap and the holding
down bolts must be designed for full load.
The cap is generally regarded as a simply supported
beam, supported by holding down bolts and loaded at the centre
as shown in Fig. 26.13.
Let
 W = Load supported at the centre,
α = Distance between centres
of holding down bolts,
l = Length of the bearing, and
t = Thickness of the cap.
We know that maximum bending moment at the centre,
M = W.a / 4
and the section modulus of the cap,
Z = l.t2 / 6

26.24 Oil Groves
The oil grooves are cut into the plain
bearing surfaces to assist in the distribution
of the oil between the rubbing surfaces. It
prevents squeezing of the oil film from
heavily loaded low speed journals and
bearings. The tendency to squeeze out oil is
greater in low speed than in high speed
bearings, because the oil has greater wedging
action at high speeds. At low speeds, the
journal rests upon a given area of oil film for a longer period of time, tending to squeeze out the oil
over the area of greatest pressure. The grooves function as oil reservoirs which holds and distributes
the oil especially during starting or at very low speeds. The oil grooves are cut at right angles to the
line of the load. The circumferential and diagonal grooves should be avoided, if possible. The
effectiveness of the oil grooves is greatly enhanced if the edges of grooves are chamfered. The shallow
and narrow grooves with chamfered edges distributes the oil more evenly. A chamfered edge should
always be provided at the parting line of the bearing.
Example 26.7. A wall bracket supports a plummer block for 80 mm diameter shaft. The length
of bearing is 120 mm. The cap of bearing is fastened by means of four bolts, two on each side of the
shaft. The cap is to withstand a load of 16.5 kN. The distance between the centre lines of the bolts is

150 mm. Determine the thickness of the bearing cap and the diameter of the bolts. Assume safe
stresses in tension for the material of the cap, which is cast iron, as 15 MPa and for bolts as 35 MPa.
Also check the deflection of the bearing cap taking E = 110 kN / mm2.
Solution : Given : d = 80 mm ; l = 120 mm ; n = 4 ; W = 16.5 kN = 16.5 × 103 N ; a = 150 mm ;

26.25 Thrust Bearings
A thrust bearing is used to guide or support the shaft which is subjected to a load along the axis
of the shaft. Such type of bearings are mainly used in turbines and propeller shafts. The thrust bearings
are of the following two types :
1. Foot step or pivot bearings, and 2. Collar
bearings.
In a foot step or pivot bearing, the loaded
shaft is vertical and the end of the shaft rests within
the bearing. In case of collar bearing, the shaft
continues through the bearing. The shaft may be
vertical or horizontal with single collar or many
collars. We shall now discuss the design aspects
of these bearings in the following articles.
26.26 Footstep or Pivot Bearings
A simple type of footstep bearing, suitable
for a slow running and lightly loaded shaft, is shown
in Fig. 26.14. If the shaft is not of steel, its end

must be fitted with a steel face. The shaft is guided in a gunmetal bush, pressed into the pedestal and
prevented from turning by means of a pin.
Since the wear is proportional to the velocity of the rubbing surface, which (i.e. rubbing velocity)
increases with the distance from the axis (i.e. radius) of the bearing, therefore the wear will be different
at different radii. Due to this wear, the distribution of pressure over the bearing surface is not
Fig. 26.14. Footstep or pivot bearings.
uniform. It may be noted that the wear is maximum at the outer radius and zero at the centre. In order
to compensate for end wear, the following two methods are employed.
1. The shaft is counter-bored at the end, as shown in Fig. 26.14 (a).
2. The shaft is supported on a pile of discs. It is usual practice to provide alternate discs of
different materials such as steel and bronze, as shown in Fig. 26.14 (b), so that the next disc comes
into play, if one disc seizes due to improper lubrication.
It may be noted that a footstep bearing is difficult to lubricate as the oil is being thrown outwards
from the centre by centrifugal force.
In designing, it is assumed that the pressure is uniformly distributed throughout the bearing
surface.
Let
 W = Load transmitted over the bearing surface,
R = Radius of the bearing surface (or shaft),
A = Cross-sectional area of the bearing surface,
p = Bearing pressure per unit area of the bearing surface between
rubbing surfaces,
μ = Coefficient of friction, and
N = Speed of the shaft in r.p.m.

2. The allowable bearing pressure (p) for the footstep bearings may be taken as follows :
(a)  For rubbing speeds (V) from 15 to 60 m/min, the bearing pressure should be such that p.V ≤ 42, when
p is in N/mm2 and V in m/min.
(b)  For rubbing speeds over 60 m/min., the pressure should not exceed 0.7 N/mm2.
(c)  For intermittent service, the bearing pressure may be taken as 10.5 N/mm2.
(d)  For very slow speeds, the bearing pressure may be taken as high as 14 N/mm2.
3. The coefficient of friction for the footstep bearing may be taken as 0.015.
26.27 Collar Bearings
We have already discussed that in a collar
bearing, the shaft continues through the bearing.
The shaft may be vertical or horizontal, with single
collar or many collars. A simple multicollar
bearing for horizontal shaft is shown in Fig. 26.15.
The collars are either integral parts of the shaft or
rigidly fastened to it. The outer diameter of the
collar is usually taken as 1.4 to 1.8 times the inner
diameter of the collar (i.e. diameter of the shaft).
The thickness of the collar is kept as one-sixth
diameter of the shaft and clearance between
collars as one-third diameter of the shaft. In
designing collar bearings, it is assumed that the
pressure is uniformly distributed over the bearing
surface.
Let
 W = Load transmitted over the bearing surface,
n = Number of collars,
R = Outer radius of the collar,
r = Inner radius of the collar,
A = Cross-sectional area of the bearing surface = n π (R2 – r2),
p = Bearing pressure per unit area of the bearing surface, between
rubbing surfaces,
μ = Coefficient of friction, and
N = Speed of the shaft in r.p.m.

Notes : 1. The coefficient of friction for the collar bearings may be taken as 0.03 to 0.05.
2. The bearing pressure for a single collar and water cooled multi-collared bearings may be taken same as
for footstep bearings.
Example 26.8.  A footstep bearing supports a shaft of 150 mm diameter which is counter-
bored at the end with a hole diameter of 50 mm. If the bearing pressure is limited to 0.8 N/mm2 and
the speed is 100 r.p.m.; find : 1. The load to be supported; 2. The power lost in friction; and 3. The
heat generated at the bearing.
Assume coefficient of friction = 0.015.
Solution. Given : D = 150 mm  or  R = 75 mm ; d = 50 mm or r = 25 mm ; p = 0.8 N/mm2 ;
N = 100 r.p.m. ; μ = 0.015

Example 26.9. The thrust of propeller shaft is absorbed by 6 collars. The rubbing surfaces of
these collars have outer diameter 300 mm and inner diameter 200 mm. If the shaft runs at 120 r.p.m.,
the bearing pressure amounts to 0.4 N/mm2. The coefficient of friction may be taken as 0.05. Assuming
that the pressure is uniformly distributed, determine the power absorbed by the collars.
Solution. Given : n = 6 ; D = 300 mm or R = 150 mm ; d = 200 mm  or  r = 100 mm ;
N = 120 r.p.m. ; p = 0.4 N/mm2 ; μ = 0.05

a marine engine is taken up by a number of collars
integral with the shaft which is 300 mm is diameter.
The thrust on the shaft is 200 kN and the speed is

assuming the bearing pressure as uniform and equal
to 0.3 N/mm2, find : 1. Number of collars required,
2. Power lost in friction, and 3. Heat generated at

Solution. Given : d = 300 mm or r = 150 mm ;

p = 0.3 N/mm2

Let                     n = Number of collars required.
Since the outer diameter of the collar (D) is taken

let us take
D = 1.4 d = 1.4 × 300 = 420 mm   or   R = 210 mm

27.1 Introduction
In rolling contact bearings, the contact between the
bearing surfaces is rolling instead of sliding as in sliding
contact bearings. We have already discussed that the
ordinary sliding bearing starts from rest with practically
metal-to-metal contact and has a high coefficient of friction.
It is an outstanding advantage of a rolling contact bearing
over a sliding bearing that it has a low starting friction.
Due to this low friction offered by rolling contact bearings,
these are called antifriction bearings.
27.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of
Rolling Contact Bearings Over Sliding
Contact Bearings
The following are some advantages and disadvantages
of rolling contact bearings over sliding contact bearings.
Contents

Rolling Contact Bearings    997
Advantages
1. Low starting and running friction except at very high speeds.
2. Ability to withstand momentary shock loads.
3. Accuracy of shaft alignment.
4. Low cost of maintenance, as no lubrication is required while in service.
5. Small overall dimensions.
6. Reliability of service.
7. Easy to mount and erect.
8. Cleanliness.
Disadvantages
1. More noisy at very high speeds.
2. Low resistance to shock loading.
3. More initial cost.
4. Design of bearing housing complicated.
27.3 Types of Rolling Contact Bearings
Following are the two types of rolling contact bearings:
1. Ball bearings; and 2. Roller bearings.
Fig. 27.1. Ball and roller bearings.
Fig. 27.2. Radial and thrust ball bearings.
The ball and roller bearings consist of an inner race which is mounted on the shaft or journal
and an outer race which is carried by the housing or casing. In between the inner and outer race, there
are balls or rollers as shown in Fig. 27.1. A number of balls or rollers are used and these are held at
proper distances by retainers so that they do not touch each other. The retainers are thin strips and is
usually in two parts which are assembled after the balls have been properly spaced. The ball bearings
are used for light loads and the roller bearings are used for heavier loads.
The rolling contact bearings, depending upon the load to be carried, are classified as :
(a) Radial bearings, and (b) Thrust bearings.
The radial and thrust ball bearings are shown in Fig. 27.2 (a) and (b) respectively. When a ball
bearing supports only a radial load (WR), the plane of rotation of the ball is normal to the centre line
of the bearing, as shown in Fig. 27.2 (a). The action of thrust load (WA) is to shift the plane of rotation
of the balls, as shown in Fig. 27.2 (b). The radial and thrust loads both may be carried simultaneously.
27.4 Types of Radial Ball Bearings
Following are the various types of radial ball bearings:
1. Single row deep groove bearing. A single row deep groove bearing is shown in Fig. 27.3 (a).
Contents
Top
998    A Textbook of Machine Design
Fig. 27.3. Types of radial ball bearings.
During assembly of this bearing, the races are offset and the maximum number of balls are placed
between the races. The races are then centred and the balls are symmetrically located by the use of a
retainer or cage. The deep groove ball bearings are used due to their high load carrying capacity and
suitability for high running speeds.
The load carrying capacity of a ball
bearing is related to the size and
number of the balls.
2. Filling notch bearing. A
filling notch bearing is shown in Fig.
27.3 (b). These bearings have notches
in the inner and outer races which
permit more balls to be inserted than
in a deep groove ball bearings. The
notches do not extend to the bottom
of the race way and therefore the balls
inserted through the notches must be
forced in position. Since this type of
bearing contains larger number of balls
than a corresponding unnotched one,
therefore it has a larger bearing load
capacity.
3. Angular contact bearing. An angular contact bearing is shown in Fig. 27.3 (c). These bearings
have one side of the outer race cut away to permit the insertion of more balls than in a deep groove
bearing but without having a notch cut into both races. This permits the bearing to carry a relatively
large axial load in one direction while also carrying a relatively large radial load. The angular contact
bearings are usually used in pairs so that thrust loads may be carried in either direction.
4. Double row bearing. A double row bearing is shown in Fig. 27.3 (d). These bearings may be
made with radial or angular contact between the balls and races. The double row bearing is appreciably
narrower than two single row bearings. The load capacity of such bearings is slightly less than twice
that of a single row bearing.
5. Self-aligning bearing. A self-aligning bearing is shown in Fig. 27.3 (e). These bearings
permit shaft deflections within 2-3 degrees. It may be noted that normal clearance in a ball bearing are
too small to accommodate any appreciable misalignment of the shaft relative to the housing. If the
unit is assembled with shaft misalignment present, then the bearing will be subjected to a load that
may be in excess of the design value and premature failure may occur. Following are the two types of
self-aligning bearings :
(a) Externally self-aligning bearing, and (b) Internally self-aligning bearing.
In an externally self-aligning bearing, the outside diameter of the outer race is ground to a
spherical surface which fits in a mating spherical surface in a housing, as shown in Fig. 27.3 (e). In
case of internally self-aligning bearing, the inner surface of the outer race is ground to a spherical
Radial ball bearing
Contents
Top
Rolling Contact Bearings    999
surface. Consequently, the outer race may be displaced through a small angle without interfering with
the normal operation of the bearing. The internally self-aligning ball bearing is interchangeable with
other ball bearings.
27.5 Standard Dimensions and Designations of Ball Bearings
The dimensions that have been standardised on an international basis are shown in Fig. 27.4.
These dimensions are a function of the bearing bore and the series of bearing. The standard dimensions
are given in millimetres. There is no standard for the size and
number of steel balls.
The bearings are designated by a number. In general, the
number consists of atleast three digits. Additional digits or letters
are used to indicate special features e.g. deep groove, filling notch
etc. The last three digits give the series and the bore of the bearing.
The last two digits from 04 onwards, when multiplied by 5, give
the bore diameter in millimetres. The third from the last digit
designates the series of the bearing. The most common ball
bearings are available in four series as follows :
1. Extra light (100),
2. Light (200),
3. Medium (300),
4. Heavy (400)
Notes : 1. If a bearing is designated by the number 305, it means that the
bearing is of medium series whose bore is 05 × 5, i.e., 25 mm.
2. The extra light and light series are used where the loads are
moderate and shaft sizes are comparatively large and also where available
space is limited.
3. The medium series has a capacity 30 to 40 per cent over the light series.
4. The heavy series has 20 to 30 per cent capacity over the medium series. This series is not used
extensively in industrial applications.

27.6 Thrust Ball Bearings
The thrust ball bearings are used for carrying thrust loads exclusively and at speeds below 2000
r.p.m. At high speeds, centrifugal force causes the balls to be forced out of the races. Therefore at
high speeds, it is recommended that angular contact ball bearings should be used in place of thrust
ball bearings.
Fig. 27.5. Thrust ball bearing.
A thrust ball bearing may be a single direction, flat face as shown in Fig. 27.5 (a) or a double
direction with flat face as shown in Fig. 27.5 (b).
27.7 Types of Roller Bearings
Following are the principal types of roller bearings :
1. Cylindrical roller bearings. A cylindrical roller bearing is shown in Fig. 27.6 (a). These
bearings have short rollers guided in a cage. These bearings are relatively rigid against radial motion
Contents
Top
1002    A Textbook of Machine Design
and have the lowest coefficient of friction of any form of heavy duty rolling-contact bearings. Such
type of bearings are used in high speed service.
2. Spherical roller bearings. A spherical roller bearing is shown in Fig. 27.6 (b). These bearings
are self-aligning bearings. The self-aligning feature is achieved by grinding one of the races in the
form of sphere. These bearings can normally tolerate angular misalignment in the order of ± 1 1
2
°  and
when used with a double row of rollers, these can carry thrust loads in either direction.
Fig. 27.6. Types of roller bearings.
3. Needle roller bearings. A needle roller bearing is shown in
Fig. 27.6 (c). These bearings are relatively slender and completely
fill the space so that neither a cage nor a retainer is needed. These
bearings are used when heavy loads are to be carried with an oscillatory
motion, e.g. piston pin bearings in heavy duty diesel engines, where
the reversal of motion tends to keep the rollers in correct alignment.
4. Tapered roller bearings. A tapered roller bearing is shown
in Fig. 27.6 (d). The rollers and race ways of these bearings are
truncated cones whose elements intersect at a common point. Such
type of bearings can carry both radial and thrust loads. These bearings
are available in various combinations as double row bearings and
with different cone angles for use with different relative magnitudes
of radial and thrust loads.

27.8 Basic Static Load Rating of Rolling Contact Bearings
The load carried by a non-rotating bearing is called a static load. The basic static load rating is
defined as the static radial load (in case of radial ball or roller bearings) or axial load (in case of thrust
ball or roller bearings) which corresponds to a total permanent deformation of the ball (or roller) and
race, at the most heavily stressed contact, equal to 0.0001 times the ball (or roller) diameter.
In single row angular contact ball bearings, the basic static load relates to the radial component
of the load, which causes a purely radial displacement of the bearing rings in relation to each other.
Note : The permanent deformation which appear in balls (or rollers) and race ways under static loads of moderate
magnitude, increase gradually with increasing load. The permissible static load is, therefore, dependent upon
the permissible magnitude of permanent deformation. Experience shows that a total permanent deformation of
0.0001 times the ball (or roller) diameter, occurring at the most heavily loaded ball (or roller) and race contact
can be tolerated in most bearing applications without impairment of bearing operation.
In certain applications where subsequent rotation of the bearing is slow and where smoothness and friction
requirements are not too exacting, a much greater total permanent deformation can be permitted. On the other
hand, where extreme smoothness is required or friction requirements are critical, less total permanent deformation
may be permitted.
According to IS : 3823–1984, the basic static load rating (C0) in newtons for ball and roller
bearings may be obtained as discussed below :
1. For radial ball bearings, the basic static radial load rating (C0) is given by
C0 = f0.i.Z.D2 cos α
where
i = Number of rows of balls in any one bearing,
Z = Number of ball per row,
D = Diameter of balls, in mm,
α = Nominal angle of contact i.e. the nominal angle between the line of
action of  the ball load and a plane perpendicular to the axis of bearing,
and
f0 = A factor depending upon the type of bearing.
The value of factor ( f0 ) for bearings made of hardened steel are taken as follows :
f0 = 3.33, for self-aligning ball bearings
= 12.3, for radial contact and angular contact groove ball bearings.
2. For radial roller bearings, the basic static radial load rating is given by
C0 = f0.i.Z.le.D cos α
where
i = Number of rows of rollers in the bearing,
Z = Number of rollers per row,
le = Effective length of contact between one roller and that ring (or washer)
where the contact is the shortest (in mm). It is equal to the overall length
of roller  minus roller chamfers or grinding undercuts,
Spherical roller

Needle roller bearings
Tapered roller bearings
Contents
Top
1004    A Textbook of Machine Design
D = Diameter of roller in mm. It is the mean diameter in case of tapered
rollers,
α = Nominal angle of contact. It is the angle between the line of action of
the roller resultant load and a plane perpendicular to the axis of the
bearing, and
f0 = 21.6, for bearings made of hardened steel.
3. For thrust ball bearings, the basic static axial load rating is given by
C0 = f0.Z.D2 sin α
where
Z = Number of balls carrying thrust in one direction, and
f0 = 49, for bearings made of hardened steel.
4. For thrust roller bearings, the basic static axial load rating is given by
C0 = f0.Z.le.D.sin α
where
Z = Number of rollers carrying thrust in one direction, and
f0 = 98.1, for bearings made of hardened steel.
27.9 Static Equivalent Load for Rolling Contact Bearings
The static equivalent load may be defined as the static radial load (in case of radial ball or roller
bearings) or axial load (in case of thrust ball or roller bearings) which, if applied, would cause the
same total permanent deformation at the most heavily stressed ball (or roller) and race contact as that
which occurs under the actual conditions of loading.
The static equivalent radial load (W0R) for radial or roller bearings under combined radial and
axial or thrust loads is given by the greater magnitude of those obtained by the following two
equations, i.e.
1.
W0R = X0.WR + Y0.WA ; and
2.  W0R = WR
where
WR = Radial load,
WA = Axial or thrust load,
X0 = Radial load factor, and
Y0 = Axial or thrust load factor.
According to IS : 3824 – 1984, the values of X0 and Y0 for different bearings are given in the
following table :

Notes : 1. The static equivalent radial load (W0R) is always greater than or equal to the radial load (WR).
2. For two similar single row angular contact ball bearings, mounted ‘face-to-face’ or ‘back-to-back’, use
the values of X0 and Y0 which apply to a double row angular contact ball bearings. For two or more similar single
row angular contact ball bearings mounted ‘in tandem’, use the values of X0 and Y0 which apply to a single row
angular contact ball bearings.
3. The static equivalent radial load (W0R) for all cylindrical roller bearings is equal to the radial load (WR).
4. The static equivalent axial or thrust load (W0A) for thrust ball or roller bearings with angle of contact
α ≠ 90º, under combined radial and axial loads is given by
W0A = 2.3 WR.tan α + WA
This formula is valid for all ratios of radial to axial load in the case of direction bearings. For single
direction bearings, it is valid where WR / WA ≤ 0.44 cot α.
5. The thrust ball or roller bearings with α = 90º can support axial loads only. The static equivalent axial
load for this type of bearing is given by
W0A = WA
27.10 Life of a Bearing
The life of an individual ball (or roller) bearing may be defined as the number of revolutions (or
hours at some given constant speed) which the bearing runs before the first evidence of fatigue
develops in the material of one of the rings or any of the rolling elements.
The rating life of a group of apparently identical ball or roller bearings is defined as the number
of revolutions (or hours at some given constant speed) that 90 per cent of a group of bearings will
complete or exceed before the first evidence of fatigue develops (i.e. only 10 per cent of a group of
bearings fail due to fatigue).
The term minimum life is also used to denote the rating life. It has been found that the life
which 50 per cent of a group of bearings will complete or exceed is approximately 5 times the life
which 90 per cent of the bearings will complete or exceed. In other words, we may say that the
average life of a bearing is 5 times the rating life (or minimum life). It may be noted that the longest
life of a single bearing is seldom longer than the 4 times the average life and the maximum life of a
single bearing is about 30 to 50 times the minimum life.

27.11  Basic Dynamic Load Rating of Rolling Contact Bearings
The basic dynamic load rating is defined as the constant stationary radial load (in case of radial
ball or roller bearings) or constant axial load (in case of thrust ball or roller bearings) which a group
of apparently identical bearings with stationary outer ring can endure for a rating life of one million
revolutions (which is equivalent to 500 hours of operation at 33.3 r.p.m.) with only 10 per cent
failure.
The basic dynamic load rating (C) in newtons for ball and roller bearings may be obtained as
discussed below :
1. According to IS: 3824 (Part 1)– 1983, the basic dynamic radial load rating for radial and
angular contact ball bearings, except the filling slot type, with balls not larger than 25.4 mm in diameter,
is given by
C = fc (i cos α)0.7 Z2/3 . D1.8
and for balls larger than 25.4 mm in diameter,
C = 3.647 fc (i cos α)0.7 Z 2/3 . D1.4

        fc
= A factor, depending upon the geometry of the bearing components, the

27.12   Dynamic Equivalent Load for Rolling Contact Bearings
The dynamic equivalent load may be defined as the constant stationary radial load (in case of
radial ball or roller bearings) or axial load (in case of thrust ball or roller bearings) which, if applied
to a bearing with rotating inner ring and stationary outer ring, would give the same life as that which
the bearing will attain under the actual conditions of load and rotation.

The dynamic equivalent radial load (W ) for radial and angular contact bearings, except the
filling slot types, under combined constant radial load (WR) and constant axial or thrust load (WA) is
given by
         W = X . V. WR + Y . WA
where
          V = A rotation factor,
= 1, for all types of bearings when the inner race is rotating,
= 1, for self-aligning bearings when inner race is stationary,
= 1.2, for all types of bearings except self-aligning, when inner race is
    stationary.
The values of radial load factor (X ) and axial or thrust load factor (Y ) for the dynamically
loaded bearings may be taken from the following table:

27.13 Dynamic Load Rating for Rolling  Contact Bearings under Variable
Loads
The approximate rating (or service) life of ball or roller bearings is based on the fundamental

where
L = Rating life,
C = Basic dynamic load rating,
W = Equivalent dynamic load,
and
k = 3, for ball bearings,
= 10/3, for roller bearings.
The relationship between the life in revolutions (L) and
the life in working hours (LH) is given by
L = 60 N . LH revolutions
where N is the speed in r.p.m.
Now consider a rolling contact bearing subjected to variable loads. Let W1, W2, W3 etc., be the
loads on the bearing for successive n1, n2, n3 etc., number of revolutions respectively.
If the bearing is operated exclusively at the constant load W1, then its life is given by
    L1

27.14 Reliability of a Bearing
We have already discussed in the previous article that the rating life is the life that 90 per cent of
a group of identical bearings will complete or exceed before the first evidence of fatigue develops.
The reliability (R) is defined as the ratio of the number of bearings which have successfully completed
L million revolutions to the total number of bearings under test. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to
select a bearing having a reliability of more than 90%. According to Wiebull, the relation between the
bearing life and the reliability is given as

whose values are

This expression is used for selecting the bearing when the reliability is other than 90%.
Note : If there are n number of bearings in the system each having the same reliability R, then the reliability of
the complete system will be
RS = Rp
where RS indicates the probability of one out of p number of bearings failing during its life time.

Example 27.1. A shaft rotating at constant speed is subjected to variable load. The bearings
supporting the shaft are subjected to stationary equivalent radial load of 3 kN for 10 per cent of time,
2 kN for 20 per cent of time, 1 kN for 30 per cent of time and no load for remaining time of cycle. If
the total life expected for the bearing is 20 × 106 revolutions at 95 per cent reliability, calculate
dynamic load rating of the ball bearing.
Solution. Given : W1 = 3 kN ; n1 = 0.1 n ; W2 = 2 kN ; n2 = 0.2 n ; W3 = 1 kN ; n3 = 0.3 n ;
W4 = 0 ; n4 = (1 – 0.1 – 0.2 – 0.3) n = 0.4 n ; L95 = 20 × 106 rev
Let
L90 = Life of the bearing corresponding to reliability of 90 per cent,

27.15 Selection of Radial Ball
Bearings
In order to select a most suitable ball
bearing, first of all, the basic dynamic radial
load is calculated. It is then multiplied by the
service factor (KS) to get the design basic
dynamic radial load capacity. The service
factor for the ball bearings is shown in the
following table.

Rolling Contact Bearings    1015
Since the average life of the bearing is 5 years at 10 hours per day, therefore life of the bearing
in hours,
LH = 5 × 300 × 10 = 15 000 hours
... (Assuming 300 working days per year)
and life of the bearing in revolutions,
L = 60 N × LH = 60 × 1600 × 15 000 = 1440 × 106 rev
We know that the basic dynamic equivalent radial load,
W = X.V.WR + Y.WA
...(i)
In order to determine the radial load factor (X) and axial load factor (Y), we require WA/ WR and
WA / C0. Since the value of basic static load capacity (C0) is not known, therefore let us take
WA / C0 = 0.5. Now from Table 27.4, we find that the values of X and Y corresponding to WA / C0
= 0.5 and WA/WR = 5000 / 4000 = 1.25 (which is greater than e = 0.44) are
X = 0.56
and
Y = 1
Since the rotational factor (V) for most of the bearings is 1, therefore basic dynamic equivalent
radial load,
W = 0.56 × 1 × 4000 + 1 × 5000 = 7240 N
From Table 27.5, we find that for uniform and steady load, the service factor (KS) for ball
bearings is 1. Therefore the bearing should be selected for W = 7240 N.
We know that basic dynamic load rating,

From Table 27.6, let us select the bearing No. 315 which has the following basic capacities,
C0 = 72 kN = 72 000 N  and C = 90 kN = 90 000 N
Now
WA/ C0 = 5000 / 72 000 = 0.07
∴From Table 27.4, the values of X and Y are
X = 0.56
and
Y = 1.6
Substituting these values in equation (i), we have dynamic equivalent load,
W = 0.56 × 1 × 4000 + 1.6 × 5000 = 10 240 N

Example 27.4. A single row angular contact ball bearing number 310 is used for an axial flow
compressor. The bearing is to carry a radial load of 2500 N and an axial or thrust load of 1500 N.
Assuming light shock load, determine the rating life of the bearing.
Solution. Given : WR = 2500 N ; WA = 1500 N
From Table 27.4, we find that for single row angular contact ball bearing, the values of radial
factor (X) and thrust factor (Y ) for WA / WR = 1500 / 2500 = 0.6 are
X = 1
and
Y = 0
Since the rotational factor (V ) for most of the bearings is 1, therefore dynamic equivalent load,
W = X.V.WR + Y.WA = 1 × 1 × 2500 + 0 × 1500 = 2500 N

From Table 27.5, we find that for light shock load, the service factor (KS) is 1.5. Therefore the
design dynamic equivalent load should be taken as
W = 2500 × 1.5 = 3750 N

... (Q k = 3, for ball bearings)
Example 27.5. Design a self-aligning ball bearing for a radial load of 7000 N and a thrust
load of 2100 N. The desired life of the bearing is 160 millions of revolutions at 300 r.p.m. Assume
uniform and steady load,
Solution. Given : WR = 7000 N ; WA = 2100 N ; L = 160 × 106 rev ; N = 300 r.p.m.
From Table 27.4, we find that for a self-aligning ball bearing, the values of radial factor (X ) and
thrust factor (Y) for WA / WR = 2100 / 7000 = 0.3, are as follows :
X = 0.65
and
Y = 3.5
Since the rotational factor (V ) for most of the bearings is 1, therefore dynamic equivalent load,
W = X.V.WR + Y.WA = 0.65 × 1 × 7000 + 3.5 × 2100 = 11 900 N
From Table 27.5, we find that for uniform and steady load, the service factor KS for ball bearings
is 1. Therefore the bearing should be selected for W = 11 900 N.

Rolling Contact Bearings    1017
We know that basic dynamic equivalent radial load considering service factor is
W = [X.V.WR + Y.WA] KS
...(i)
It is given that radial load factor (X ) = 1 and axial load factor (Y ) = 1.5. Since the rotational
factor (V) for most of the bearings is 1, therefore equation (i) may be written as
W = (WR + 1.5 WA) KS
Now, substituting the values of WR, WA and KS for different operating cycle, we have
W1 = (WR1 + 1.5 WA1) KS1 = (2000 + 1.5 × 1200) 3 = 11 400 N
W2 = (WR2 + 1.5 WA2) KS2 = (1500 + 1.5 × 1000) 1.5 = 4500 N
W3 = (WR3 + 1.5 WA3) KS3 = (1000 + 1.5 × 1500) 2 = 6500 N
and
W4 = (WR4 + 1.5 WA4) KS4 = (1200 + 1.5 × 2000) 1 = 4200 N
We know that life of the bearing in revolutions
L = 60 N.LH = 60 N × 15 000 = 0.9 × 106 N rev
∴Life of the bearing for 1/10 of a cycle,
L1 =  1
10  × 0.9 × 106 N1 = 1
10  × 0.9 × 106 × 400 = 36 × 106 rev
Similarly, life of the bearing for the next 1/10 of a cycle,
L2 = 1
10  × 0.9 × 106 N2 = 1
10  × 0.9 × 106 × 500 = 45 × 106 rev

L3 = 1
5  × 0.9 × 106 N3 = 1

27.16 Materials and Manufacture of Ball and Roller Bearings
Since the rolling elements and the races are subjected to high local stresses of varying magnitude
with each revolution of the bearing, therefore the material of the rolling element (i.e. steel) should be
of high quality. The balls are generally made of high carbon chromium steel. The material of both the
balls and races are heat treated to give extra hardness and toughness.
The balls are manufactured by hot forging on hammers from steel rods. They are then heat-
treated, ground and polished. The races are also formed by forging and then heat-treated, ground and
polished.
27.17 Lubrication of Ball and Roller Bearings
The ball and roller bearings are lubricated for the following purposes :
1. To reduce friction and wear between the sliding parts of the bearing,
2. To prevent rusting or corrosion of the bearing surfaces,
3. To protect the bearing surfaces from water, dirt etc., and
4. To dissipate the heat.
In general, oil or light grease is used for lubricating ball and roller bearings. Only pure mineral
oil or a calcium-base grease should be used. If there is a possibility of moisture contact, then potassium
or sodium-base greases may be used. Another additional advantage of the grease is that it forms a seal
to keep out dirt or any other foreign substance. It may be noted that too much oil or grease cause the
temperature of the bearing to rise due to churning. The temperature should be kept below 90ºC and in
no case a bearing should operate above 150ºC.

28.1 Introduction
We have discussed earlier that the slipping of a belt or
rope is a common phenomenon, in the transmission of
motion or power between two shafts. The effect of slipping
is to reduce the velocity ratio of the system. In precision
machines, in which a definite velocity ratio is of importance
(as in watch mechanism), the only positive drive is by gears
or toothed wheels. A gear drive is also provided, when
the distance between the driver and the follower is very
small.
28.2 Friction Wheels
The motion and power transmitted by gears is
kinematically equivalent to that transmitted by frictional
wheels or discs. In order to understand how the motion can
be transmitted by two toothed wheels, consider two plain
circular wheels A and B mounted on shafts. The wheels have
sufficient rough surfaces and press against each other as
shown in Fig. 28.1.

*
We know that frictional resistance, F = μ . RN
where
μ = Coefficient of friction between the rubbing surfaces of the two wheels, and
RN = Normal reaction between the two rubbing surfaces.
Fig. 28.1. Friction wheels.
Fig. 28.2. Gear or toothed wheel.
Let the wheel A is keyed to the rotating shaft and the wheel B to the shaft to be rotated. A little
consideration will show that when the wheel A is rotated by a rotating shaft, it will rotate the wheel B
in the opposite direction as shown in Fig. 28.1. The wheel B will be rotated by the wheel A so long as
the tangential force exerted by the wheel A does not exceed the maximum frictional resistance between
the two wheels. But when the tangential force (P) exceeds the *frictional resistance (F), slipping will
take place between the two wheels.
In order to avoid the slipping, a number of projections (called teeth) as shown in Fig. 28.2 are
provided on the periphery of the wheel A which will fit into the corresponding recesses on the periphery
of the wheel B. A friction wheel with the teeth cut on it is known as gear or toothed wheel. The usual
connection to show the toothed wheels is by their pitch circles.
Note : Kinematically, the friction wheels running without slip and toothed gearing are identical. But due to the
possibility of slipping of wheels, the friction wheels can only be
used for transmission of small powers.
28.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of
Gear Drives
The following are the advantages and disadvantages
of the gear drive as compared to other drives, i.e. belt, rope
and chain drives :
Advantages
1.
It transmits exact velocity ratio.
2.
It may be used to transmit large power.
3.
It may be used for small centre distances of shafts.
4.
It has high efficiency.
5.
It has reliable service.
6.
It has compact layout.
Disadvantages
1.
Since the manufacture of gears require special
tools and equipment, therefore it is costlier than
other drives.
In bicycle gears are used to transmit
motion. Mechanical advantage can
be changed by changing gears.

2.
The error in cutting teeth may cause vibrations and noise during operation.
3.
It requires suitable lubricant and reliable method of applying it, for the proper operation of
gear drives.
28.4 Classification of Gears
The gears or toothed wheels may be classified as follows :
1.  According to the position of axes of the shafts. The axes of the two shafts between which
the motion is to be transmitted, may be
(a) Parallel, (b) Intersecting, and (c) Non-intersecting and non-parallel.
The two parallel and co-planar shafts connected by the gears is shown in Fig. 28.2. These gears
are called spur gears and the arrangement is known as spur gearing. These gears have teeth parallel
to the axis of the wheel as shown in Fig. 28.2. Another name given to the spur gearing is helical
gearing, in which the teeth are inclined to the axis. The single and double helical gears connecting
parallel shafts are shown in Fig. 28.3 (a) and (b) respectively. The object of the double helical gear is
to balance out the end thrusts that are induced in single helical gears when transmitting load. The
double helical gears are known as herringbone gears. A pair of spur gears are kinematically equivalent
to a pair of cylindrical discs, keyed to a parallel shaft having line contact.
The two non-parallel or intersecting, but coplaner shafts connected by gears is shown in
Fig. 28.3 (c). These gears are called bevel gears and the arrangement is known as bevel gearing.
The bevel gears, like spur gears may also have their teeth inclined to the face of the bevel, in
which case they are known as helical bevel gears.
Fig. 28.3
The two non-intersecting and non-parallel i.e. non-coplanar shafts connected by gears is shown
in Fig. 28.3 (d). These gears are called skew bevel gears or spiral gears and the arrangement is
known as skew bevel gearing or spiral gearing. This type of gearing also have a line contact, the
rotation of which about the axes generates the two pitch surfaces known as hyperboloids.
Notes : (i) When equal bevel gears (having equal teeth) connect two shafts whose axes are mutually perpendicu-
lar, then the bevel gears are known as mitres.
(ii) A hyperboloid is the solid formed by revolving a straight line about an axis (not in the same plane),
such that every point on the line remains at a constant distance from the axis.
(iii) The worm gearing is essentially a form of spiral gearing in which the shafts are usually at right angles.
2. According to the peripheral velocity of the gears. The gears, according to the peripheral
velocity of the gears, may be classified as :
(a) Low velocity,  (b) Medium velocity, and  (c) High velocity.
Contents
Top
1024    A Textbook of Machine Design
*
A straight line may also be defined as a wheel of infinite radius.
Fig. 28.5. Rack and pinion.
The gears having velocity less than 3 m/s are termed as low velocity gears and gears having
velocity between 3 and 15 m / s are known as medium velocity gears. If the velocity of gears is more
than 15 m / s, then these are called high speed gears.
3.  According to the type of gearing. The gears, according to the type of gearing, may be
classified as :
(a) External gearing, (b) Internal gearing, and (c) Rack and pinion.
Fig. 28.4
In external gearing, the gears of the two shafts mesh externally with each other as shown in
Fig. 28.4 (a). The larger of these two wheels is called spur wheel or gear and the smaller wheel is
called pinion. In an external gearing, the motion of the two wheels is always unlike, as shown in
Fig. 28.4 (a).
In internal gearing, the gears of the two shafts mesh internally with each other as shown in Fig.
28.4 (b). The larger of these two wheels is called annular wheel and the smaller wheel is called
pinion. In an internal gearing, the motion of the wheels is always like as shown in Fig. 28.4 (b).
Sometimes, the gear of a shaft meshes externally and
internally with the gears in a *straight line, as shown in Fig.
28.5. Such a type of gear is called rack and pinion. The
straight line gear is called rack and the circular wheel is
called pinion. A little consideration will show that with the
help of a rack and pinion, we can convert linear motion into
rotary motion and vice-versa as shown in Fig. 28.5.
4. According to the position of teeth on the gear
surface. The teeth on the gear surface may be
(a) Straight, (b) Inclined, and (c) Curved.
We have discussed earlier that the spur gears have
straight teeth whereas helical gears have their teeth inclined
to the wheel rim. In case of spiral gears, the teeth are curved
over the rim surface.
28.5 Terms used in Gears
The following terms, which will be mostly used in this chapter, should be clearly understood at
this stage. These terms are illustrated in Fig. 28.6.
1. Pitch circle. It is an imaginary circle which by pure rolling action, would give the same
motion as the actual gear.
Contents

Spur Gears     1025
2. Pitch circle diameter. It is the diameter of the pitch circle. The size of the gear is usually
specified by the pitch circle diameter. It is also called as pitch diameter.
3. Pitch point. It is a common point of contact between two pitch circles.
4. Pitch surface. It is the surface of the rolling discs which the meshing gears have replaced at
the pitch circle.
5. Pressure angle or angle of obliquity. It is the angle between the common normal to two gear
teeth at the point of contact and the common tangent at the pitch point. It is usually denoted by φ. The
standard pressure angles are 
1 2
14 / °  and 20°.
6. Addendum. It is the radial distance of a tooth from the pitch circle to the top of the tooth.
7. Dedendum. It is the radial distance of a tooth from the pitch circle to the bottom of the tooth.
8. Addendum circle. It is the circle drawn through the top of the teeth and is concentric with the
pitch circle.
9. Dedendum circle. It is the circle drawn through the bottom of the teeth. It is also called root
circle.
Note : Root circle diameter = Pitch circle diameter × cos φ, where φ is the pressure angle.
10. Circular pitch. It is the distance measured on the circumference of the pitch circle from
a point of one tooth to the corresponding point on the next tooth. It is usually denoted by pc.
Mathematically,
        Circular pitch,
pc = π D/T
where
D = Diameter of the pitch circle, and
T = Number of teeth on the wheel.
A little consideration will show that the two gears will mesh together correctly, if the two wheels
have the same circular pitch.
Note : If D1 and D2 are the diameters of the two meshing gears having the teeth T1 and T2 respectively; then for
them to mesh correctly,

circles of the wheel and pinion.
27. Arc of contact. It is the path traced by a point on the pitch circle from the beginning to the
end of engagement of a given pair of teeth. The arc of contact consists of two parts, i.e.
(a)  Arc of approach. It is the portion of the path of contact from the beginning of the engagement
to the pitch point.
(b)  Arc of recess. It is the portion of the path of contact from the pitch point to the end of the
engagement of a pair of teeth.
Note : The ratio of the length of arc of contact to the circular pitch is known as contact ratio i.e.  number of pairs
of teeth in contact.
28.6 Condition for Constant Velocity Ratio of Gears–Law of Gearing
Consider the portions of the two teeth, one on the wheel 1 (or pinion) and the other on the wheel
2, as shown by thick line curves in Fig. 28.7. Let the two teeth come in contact at point Q, and the
wheels rotate in the directions as shown in the figure.
Let T T be the common tangent and MN be the common normal to the curves at point of contact
Q. From the centres O1 and O2, draw O1M and O2N perpendicular to MN. A little consideration will
show that the point Q moves in the direction QC, when considered as a point on wheel 1, and in the
direction QD when considered as a point on wheel 2.
Let v1 and v2 be the velocities of the point Q on the wheels 1 and 2 respectively. If the teeth are
to remain in contact, then the components of these velocities
along the common normal MN must be equal.
∴
v1 cos α = v2 cos β

O1 and O2, or the common normal to the two surfaces at the point of contact Q intersects the line of
centres at point P which divides the centre distance inversely as the ratio of angular velocities.
Therefore, in order to have a constant
angular velocity ratio for all positions of the
wheels, P must be the fixed point (called pitch
point) for the two wheels. In other words, the
common normal at the point of contact
between a pair of teeth must always pass
through the pitch point. This is fundamental
condition which must be satisfied while
designing the profiles for the teeth of gear
wheels. It is also known as law of gearing.
Notes : 1. The above condition is fulfilled by teeth
of involute form, provided that the root circles from
which the profiles are generated are tangential to
the common normal.
2. If the shape of one tooth profile is arbitrary
chosen and another tooth is designed to satisfy the
above condition, then the second tooth is said to be
conjugate to the first. The conjugate teeth are not
in common use because of difficulty in manufacture and cost of production.

28.7 Forms of Teeth
We have discussed in Art. 28.6 (Note 2) that conjugate teeth are not in common use. Therefore,
in actual practice, following are the two types of teeth commonly used.
1. Cycloidal teeth ; and
2. Involute teeth.
We shall discuss both the above mentioned types of teeth in the following articles. Both these
forms of teeth satisfy the condition as explained in Art. 28.6.
28.8 Cycloidal Teeth
A cycloid is the curve traced by a point on the circumference of a circle which rolls without
slipping on a fixed straight line. When a circle rolls without slipping on the outside of a fixed circle,
the curve traced by a point on the circumference of a circle is known as epicycloid. On the other hand,
if a circle rolls without slipping on the inside of a fixed circle, then the curve traced by a point on the
circumference of a circle is called hypocycloid.
Fig. 28.8. Construction of cycloidal teeth of a gear.
In Fig. 28.8 (a), the fixed line or pitch line of a rack is shown. When the circle C rolls without
slipping above the pitch line in the direction as indicated in Fig. 28.8 (a), then the point P on the circle
traces the epicycloid PA. This represents the face of the cycloidal tooth profile. When the circle D
rolls without slipping below the pitch line, then the point P on the circle D traces hypocycloid PB
which represents the flank of the cycloidal tooth. The profile BPA is one side of the cycloidal rack
tooth. Similarly, the two curves P' A' and P' B' forming the opposite side of the tooth profile are traced
by the point P' when the circles C and D roll in the opposite directions.
In the similar way, the cycloidal teeth of a gear may be constructed as shown in Fig. 28.8 (b).
The circle C is rolled without slipping on the outside of the pitch circle and the point P on the circle
C traces epicycloid PA, which represents the face of the cycloidal tooth. The circle D is rolled on the
inside of pitch circle and the point P on the circle D traces hypocycloid PB, which represents the flank
of the tooth profile. The profile BPA is one side of the cycloidal tooth. The opposite side of the tooth
is traced as explained above.
The construction of the two mating cycloidal teeth is shown in Fig. 28.9. A point on the circle D
will trace the flank of the tooth T1 when circle D rolls without slipping on the inside of pitch circle of
wheel 1 and face of tooth T2 when the circle D rolls without slipping on the outside of pitch circle of
wheel 2. Similarly, a point on the circle C will trace the face of tooth T1 and flank of tooth T2. The
rolling circles C and D may have unequal diameters, but if several wheels are to be interchangeable,
they must have rolling circles of equal diameters.

Fig. 28.9. Construction of two mating cycloidal teeth.
A little consideration will show that the common normal
XX at the point of contact between two cycloidal teeth always
passes through the pitch point, which is the fundamental con-
dition for a constant velocity ratio.
28.9 Involute Teeth
An involute of a circle is a plane curve generated by a
point on a tangent, which rolls on the circle without slipping
or by a point on a taut string which is unwrapped from a reel
as shown in Fig. 28.10 (a). In connection with toothed wheels,
the circle is known as base circle. The involute is traced as
follows :
Let A be the starting point of the involute. The base circle
is divided into equal number of parts e.g. AP1, P1 P2, P2 P3
etc.The tangents at P1, P2, P3 etc., are drawn and the lenghts
P1A1, P2A2, P3A3 equal to the arcs AP1, AP2 and AP3 are set
off. Joining the points A, A1, A2, A3 etc., we obtain the involute
curve AR. A little consideration will show that at any instant
A3, the tangent A3T to the involute is perpendicular to P3A3 and
P3A3 is the normal to the involute. In other words, normal at
any point of an involute is a tangent to the circle.
Now, let O1 and O2 be the fixed centres of the two base
circles as shown in Fig. 28.10(b). Let the corresponding
involutes AB and A'B' be in contact at point Q. MQ and NQ are
normals to the involute at Q and are tangents to base circles.
Since the normal for an involute at a given point is the tangent
drawn from that point to the base circle, therefore the common
normal MN at Q is also the common tangent to the two base
circles. We see that the common normal MN intersects the line
of centres O1O2 at the fixed point P (called pitch point).
Therefore the involute teeth satisfy the fundamental condition
of constant velocity ratio.

which determines the ratio of the radii of the two base circles. The radii of the base circles is given by

A little consideration will show, that if the centre distance is changed, then the radii of pitch
circles also changes. But their ratio remains unchanged, because it is equal to the ratio of the two radii
of the base circles [See equation (i)]. The common normal, at the point of contact, still passes through
the pitch point. As a result of this, the wheel continues to work correctly*. However, the pressure
angle increases with the increase in centre distance.
28.10 Comparison Between Involute and Cycloidal Gears
In actual practice, the involute gears are more commonly used as compared to cycloidal gears,
due to the following advantages :
Advantages of involute gears
Following are the advantages of involute gears :
1. The most important advantage of the involute gears is that the centre distance for a pair of
involute gears can be varied within limits without changing the velocity ratio. This is not true for
cycloidal gears which requires exact centre distance to be maintained.
2. In involute gears, the pressure angle, from the start of the engagement of teeth to the end of
the engagement, remains constant. It is necessary for smooth running and less wear of gears. But in
cycloidal gears, the pressure angle is maximum at the beginning of engagement, reduces to zero at
pitch point, starts increasing and again becomes maximum at the end of engagement. This results in
less smooth running of gears.
3. The face and flank of involute teeth are generated by a single curve whereas in cycloidal
gears, double curves (i.e. epicycloid and hypocycloid) are required for the face and flank respectively.
*
It is not the case with cycloidal teeth.
Contents
Top
1032    A Textbook of Machine Design
Thus the involute teeth are easy to manufacture than cycloidal teeth. In involute system, the basic rack
has straight teeth and the same can be cut with simple tools.
Note : The only disadvantage of the involute teeth is that the interference occurs (Refer Art. 28.13) with pinions
having smaller number of teeth. This may be avoided by altering the heights of addendum and dedendum of the
mating teeth or the angle of obliquity of the teeth.
Advantages of cycloidal gears
Following are the advantages of cycloidal gears :
1.  Since the cycloidal teeth have wider flanks, therefore the cycloidal gears are stronger than
the involute gears for the same pitch. Due to this reason, the cycloidal teeth are preferred specially for
cast teeth.
2.  In cycloidal gears, the contact takes place between a convex flank and concave surface,
whereas in involute gears, the convex surfaces are in contact. This condition results in less wear in
cycloidal gears as compared to involute gears. However the difference in wear is negligible.
3.  In cycloidal gears, the interference does not occur at all. Though there are advantages of
cycloidal gears but they are outweighed by the greater simplicity and flexibility of the involute gears.
28.11 Systems of Gear Teeth
The following four systems of gear teeth are commonly used in practice.
1. 
1
2
14 / °  Composite system, 2. 
1
2
14 / °  Full depth involute system, 3. 20° Full depth involute
system, and 4. 20° Stub involute system.
The 
1
2
14 / °  composite system is used for general purpose gears. It is stronger but has no inter-
changeability. The tooth profile of this system has cycloidal curves at the top and bottom and involute
curve at the middle portion. The teeth are produced by formed milling cutters or hobs. The tooth
profile of the 
1
2
14 / °  full depth involute system was developed for use with gear hobs for spur and
helical gears.
The tooth profile of the 20° full depth involute system may be cut by hobs. The increase of the
pressure angle from 
1
2
14 / °  to 20° results in a stronger tooth, because the tooth acting as a beam is
wider at the base. The 20° stub involute system has a strong tooth to take heavy loads.

28.13 Interference in Involute Gears
A pinion gearing with a wheel is shown in Fig.
28.11. MN is the common tangent to the base circles
and KL is the path of contact between the two mating
teeth. A little consideration will show, that if the radius
of the addendum circle of pinion is increased to O1N,
the point of contact L will move from L to N. When
this radius is further increased, the point of contact L
will be on the inside of base circle of wheel and not
on the involute profile of tooth on wheel. The tip of
tooth on the pinion will then undercut the tooth on the
wheel at the root and remove part of the involute
profile of tooth on the wheel. This effect is known as
interference and occurs when the teeth are being cut.
In brief, the phenomenon when the tip of a tooth
undercuts the root on its mating gear is known as
interference.
Fig. 28.11. Interference in involute gears.
Similarly, if the radius of the addendum circle of the wheel increases beyond O2M, then the tip
of tooth on wheel will cause interference with the tooth on pinion. The points M and N are called
interference points. Obviously interference may be avoided if the path of contact does not extend
beyond interference points. The limiting value of the radius of the addendum circle of the pinion is
O1N and of the wheel is O2M.
From the above discussion, we conclude that the interference may only be avoided, if the point
of contact between the two teeth is always on the involute profiles of both the teeth. In other words,
interference may only be prevented, if the addendum circles of the two mating gears cut the common
tangent to the base circles between the points of tangency.

28.14 Minimum Number of Teeth on the Pinion in Order to Avoid
Interference
We have seen in the previous article that the interference may only be avoided, if the point of
contact between the two teeth is always on the involute profiles of both the teeth. The minimum
number of teeth on the pinion which will mesh with any gear (also rack) without interference are
given in the following table.

28.15 Gear Materials
The material used for the manufacture of gears depends upon the strength and service conditions
like wear, noise etc. The gears may be manufactured from metallic or non-metallic materials. The
metallic gears with cut teeth are commercially obtainable in cast iron, steel and bronze. The non-
metallic materials like wood, rawhide, compressed paper and synthetic resins like nylon are used for
gears, especially for reducing noise.
The cast iron is widely used for the manufacture of gears due to its good wearing properties,
excellent machinability and ease of producing complicated shapes by casting method. The cast iron
gears with cut teeth may be employed, where smooth action is not important.
The steel is used for high strength gears and steel may be plain carbon steel or alloy steel.
The steel gears are usually heat treated in order to combine properly the toughness and tooth
hardness.

28.16 Design Considerations for a Gear Drive
In the design of a gear drive, the following data is usually given :
1.
The power to be transmitted.
2.
The speed of the driving gear,
3.
The speed of the driven gear or the velocity ratio, and
4.
The centre distance.
The following requirements must be met in the design of a gear drive :
(a) The gear teeth should have sufficient strength so that they will not fail under static loading
or dynamic loading during normal running conditions.
(b) The gear teeth should have wear characteristics so that their life is satisfactory.
(c) The use of space and material should be economical.
(d) The alignment of the gears and deflections of the shafts must be considered because they
effect on the performance of the gears.
(e) The lubrication of the gears must be satisfactory.

28.17 Beam Strength of Gear Teeth – Lewis Equation
The beam strength of gear teeth is determined from an equation (known as *Lewis equation)
and the load carrying ability of the toothed gears as determined by this equation gives satisfactory
results. In the investigation, Lewis assumed that as the load is being transmitted from one gear to
another, it is all given and taken by one tooth, because it is not always safe to assume that the load is
distributed among several teeth. When contact begins, the load is assumed to be at the end of the
driven teeth and as contact ceases, it is at the end of the driving teeth. This may not be true when the
number of teeth in a pair of mating gears is large, because the load may be distributed among several
teeth. But it is almost certain that at some time during the contact of teeth, the proper distribution of
load does not exist and that one tooth must transmit
the full load. In any pair of gears having unlike
number of teeth, the gear which have the fewer
teeth (i.e. pinion) will be the weaker, because the
tendency toward undercutting of the teeth becomes
more pronounced in gears as the number of teeth
becomes smaller.
Consider each tooth as a cantilever beam
loaded by a normal load (WN) as shown in Fig.
28.12. It is resolved into two components i.e.
tangential component (WT) and radial component
(WR) acting perpendicular and parallel to the centre
line of the tooth respectively. The tangential component (WT) induces a bending stress which tends to
break the tooth. The radial component (WR) induces a compressive stress of relatively small magnitude,
therefore its effect on the tooth may be neglected. Hence, the bending stress is used as the basis for
design calculations. The critical section or the section of maximum bending stress may be obtained
by drawing a parabola through A and tangential to the tooth curves at B and C. This parabola, as
shown dotted in Fig. 28.12, outlines a beam of uniform strength, i.e. if the teeth are shaped like a
parabola, it will have the same stress at all the sections. But the tooth is larger than the parabola at
every section except BC. We therefore, conclude that the section BC is the section of maximum stress
or the critical section. The maximum value of the bending stress (or the permissible working stress),
at the section BC is given by
σw = M.y / I
...(i)
where
M = Maximum bending moment at the critical section BC = WT × h,
WT = Tangential load acting at the tooth,
h = Length of the tooth,
y = Half the thickness of the tooth (t) at critical section BC = t/2,
I = Moment of inertia about the centre line of the tooth = b.t3/12,
b = Width of gear face.
Substituting the values for M, y and I in equation (i), we get

or

pitch) and its profile.

In 1892, Wilfred Lewis investigated for the strength of gear teeth. He derived an equation which is now
extensively used by industry in determining the size and proportions of the gear.

 therefore in order to find the value of y, the
quantities t, h and pc may be determined analytically or measured from the drawing similar
to Fig. 28.12. It may be noted that if the gear is enlarged, the distances t, h and pc will each increase
proportionately. Therefore the value of y will remain unchanged. A little consideration will show
that the value of y is independent of the size of the tooth and depends only on the number of teeth
on a gear and the system of teeth. The value of y in terms of the number of teeth may be expressed
as follows :

28.18 Permissible Working Stress for Gear Teeth in the Lewis Equation
The permissible working stress (σw) in the Lewis equation depends upon the material for which
an allowable static stress (σo) may be determined. The allowable static stress is the stress at the

effects which become more severe as the pitch line velocity increases, the value of σw is reduced.

28.19 Dynamic Tooth Load
In the previous article, the velocity factor was used to make approximate allowance for the
effect of dynamic loading. The dynamic loads are due to the following reasons :
1.
Inaccuracies of tooth spacing,
2.
Irregularities in tooth profiles, and
3.
Deflections of teeth under load.
A closer approximation to the actual conditions may be made by the use of equations based on
extensive series of tests, as follows :
WD = WT + WI
where
WD = Total dynamic load,
WT = Steady load due to transmitted torque, and
WI = Increment load due to dynamic action.
The increment load (WI) depends upon the pitch line velocity, the face width, material of the
gears, the accuracy of cut and the tangential load. For average conditions, the dynamic load is
determined by using the following Buckingham equation, i.e.
WD =

28.20 Static Tooth Load
The static tooth load (also called beam strength or endurance strength of the tooth) is obtained
by Lewis formula by substituting flexural endurance limit or elastic limit stress (σe) in place of
permissible working stress (σw).
∴Static tooth load or beam strength of the tooth,
WS = σe.b.pc.y = σe.b.π m.y

For safety, against tooth breakage, the static tooth load (WS) should be greater than the dynamic
load (WD). Buckingham suggests the following relationship between WS and WD.
For steady loads,
WS ≥ 1.25 WD
For pulsating loads,
WS ≥ 1.35 WD
For shock loads,
WS ≥ 1.5 WD
Note : For steel, the flexural endurance limit (σe) may be obtained by using the following relation :
σe = 1.75 × B.H.N. (in MPa)
28.21 Wear Tooth Load
The maximum load that gear teeth can carry, without premature wear, depends upon the radii of
curvature of the tooth profiles and on the elasticity and surface fatigue limits of the materials. The
maximum or the limiting load for satisfactory wear of gear teeth, is obtained by using the following
Buckingham equation, i.e.
Ww = DP.b.Q.K
where
Ww = Maximum or limiting load for wear in newtons,
DP = Pitch circle diameter of the pinion in mm,
b = Face width of the pinion in mm,

Notes : 1. The surface endurance limit for steel may be obtained from the following equation :
σes = (2.8 × B.H.N. – 70) N/mm2
2. The maximum limiting wear load (Ww) must be greater than the dynamic load (WD).
28.22 Causes of Gear Tooth Failure
The different modes of failure of gear teeth and their possible remedies to avoid the failure, are
as follows :
1. Bending failure. Every gear tooth acts as a cantilever. If the total repetitive dynamic load
acting on the gear tooth is greater than the beam strength of the gear tooth, then the gear tooth will fail
in bending, i.e. the gear tooth will break.
In order to avoid such failure, the module and face width of the gear is adjusted so that the beam
strength is greater than the dynamic load.
2. Pitting. It is the surface fatigue failure which occurs due to many repetition of Hertz contact
stresses. The failure occurs when the surface contact stresses are higher than the endurance limit of
the material. The failure starts with the formation of pits which continue to grow resulting in the
rupture of the tooth surface.
In order to avoid the pitting, the dynamic load between the gear tooth should be less than the
wear strength of the gear tooth.
3. Scoring. The excessive heat is generated when there is an excessive surface pressure, high
speed or supply of lubricant fails. It is a stick-slip phenomenon in which alternate shearing and welding
takes place rapidly at high spots.
This type of failure can be avoided by properly designing the parameters such as speed, pressure and
proper flow of the lubricant, so that the temperature at the rubbing faces is within the permissible limits.
4. Abrasive wear. The foreign particles in the lubricants such as dirt, dust or burr enter between
the tooth and damage the form of tooth. This type of failure can be avoided by providing filters for the
lubricating oil or by using high viscosity lubricant oil which enables the formation of thicker oil film
and hence permits easy passage of such particles without damaging the gear surface.
5. Corrosive wear. The corrosion of the tooth surfaces is mainly caused due to the presence of
corrosive elements such as additives present in the lubricating oils. In order to avoid this type of wear,
proper anti-corrosive additives should be used.
28.23 Design Procedure for Spur Gears
In order to design spur gears, the following procedure may be followed :
1. First of all, the design tangential tooth load is obtained from the power transmitted and the
pitch line velocity by using the following relation :
WT =
S
P
C

where
WT = Permissible tangential tooth load in newtons,
P = Power transmitted in watts,
*v = Pitch line velocity in m / s

D = Pitch circle diameter in metres,
*
We know that circular pitch,
pc = π D / T = π m
...(Q m = D / T)
∴
D = m.T
Thus, the pitch line velocity may also be obtained by using the following relation, i.e.

Note : The above values for service factor are for enclosed well lubricated gears. In case of non-enclosed and
grease lubricated gears, the values given in the above table should be divided by 0.65.
2. Apply the Lewis equation as follows :
WT = σw.b.pc.y = σw.b.π m.y
= (σo.Cv) b.π m.y
...(Q σw = σo.Cv)
Notes : (i) The Lewis equation is applied only to the weaker of the two wheels (i.e. pinion or gear).
(ii) When both the pinion and the gear are made of the same material, then pinion is the weaker.
(iii) When the pinion and the gear are made of different materials, then the product of (σw × y) or (σo × y)
is the *deciding factor. The Lewis equation is used to that wheel for which (σw × y) or (σo × y) is less.
*
We see from the Lewis equation that for a pair of mating gears, the quantities like WT, b, m and Cv are
constant. Therefore (σw × y) or (σo × y) is the only deciding factor.

(iv) The product (σw × y) is called strength factor of the gear.
(v) The face width (b) may be taken as 3 pc to 4 pc (or 9.5 m to 12.5 m) for cut teeth and 2 pc to 3 pc
 (or 6.5 m to 9.5 m) for cast teeth.

In calculating the dynamic load (WD), the value of tangential load (WT) may be calculated by
neglecting the service factor (CS) i.e.
WT = P / v, where P is in watts and v in m / s.
4. Find the static tooth load (i.e. beam strength or the endurance strength of the tooth) by using
the relation,
WS = σe.b.pc.y = σe.b.π m.y
For safety against breakage, WS should be greater than WD.
5. Finally, find the wear tooth load by using the relation,
Ww = DP.b.Q.K
The wear load (Ww) should not be less than the dynamic load (WD).
Example 28.1. The following particulars of a single reduction spur gear are given :
Gear ratio = 10 : 1; Distance between centres = 660 mm approximately; Pinion transmits 500
kW at 1800 r.p.m.; Involute teeth of standard proportions (addendum = m) with pressure angle of
22.5°; Permissible normal pressure between teeth = 175 N per mm of width. Find :
1. The nearest standard module if no interference is to occur;
2. The number of teeth on each wheel;
3. The necessary width of the pinion; and
4. The load on the bearings of the wheels due to power transmitted.
Solution : Given : G = TG / TP = DG / DP = 10 ; L = 660 mm ; P = 500 kW = 500 × 103 W ;
NP = 1800 r.p.m. ; φ = 22.5° ; WN = 175 N/mm width

Let
m = Required module,
TP = Number of teeth on the pinion,
TG = Number of teeth on the gear,

∴
m = DP / TP = 120 / 14 = 8.6 mm
Since the nearest standard value of the module is 8 mm, therefore we shall take

Example 28.2. A bronze spur pinion rotating at 600 r.p.m. drives a cast iron spur gear at a
transmission ratio of 4 : 1. The allowable static stresses for the bronze pinion and cast iron gear are
84 MPa and 105 MPa respectively.
The pinion has 16 standard 20° full depth involute teeth of module 8 mm. The face width of
both the gears is 90 mm. Find the power that can be transmitted from the standpoint of strength.
Solution. Given : NP = 600 r.p.m. ; V.R. = TG / TP = 4 ; σOP = 84 MPa = 84 N / mm2 ;
σOG = 105 MPa = 105 N/mm2 ; TP = 16 ; m = 8 mm ; b = 90 mm

∴
σOP × yP = 84 × 0.097 = 8.148
and
σOG × yG = 105 × 0.14 = 14.7
Since (σOP × yP) is less than (σOG × yG), therefore the pinion is weaker. Now using the Lewis
equation for the pinion, we have tangential load on the tooth (or beam strength of the tooth),
WT = σwP.b.π m.yP = (σOP × Cv) b.π m.yP
(Q σWP = σOP.Cv)
= 84 × 0.427 × 90 × π × 8 × 0.097 = 7870 N
∴ Power that can be transmitted

Example 28.3. A pair of straight teeth spur gears is to transmit 20 kW when the pinion rotates
at 300 r.p.m. The velocity ratio is 1 : 3. The allowable static stresses for the pinion and gear materials
are 120 MPa and 100 MPa respectively.
The pinion has 15 teeth and its face width is 14 times the module. Determine : 1. module;
2. face width; and 3. pitch circle diameters of both the pinion and the gear from the standpoint of

Example 28.4. A gear drive is required to transmit a maximum power of 22.5 kW. The velocity
ratio is 1:2 and r.p.m. of the pinion is 200. The approximate centre distance between the shafts may
be taken as 600 mm. The teeth has 20° stub involute profiles. The static stress for the gear material
(which is cast iron) may be taken as 60 MPa and face width as 10 times the module. Find the module,
face width and number of teeth on each gear.
Check the design for dynamic and wear loads. The deformation or dynamic factor in the

Since the maximum wear load is much more than the tangential load on the tooth, therefore the

Example 28.6. A reciprocating compressor is to be connected to an electric motor with the
help of spur gears. The distance between the shafts is to be 500 mm. The speed of the electric motor
is 900 r.p.m. and the speed of the compressor shaft is desired to be 200 r.p.m. The torque, to be
transmitted is 5000 N-m. Taking starting torque as 25% more than the normal torque, determine :
1. Module and face width of the gears using 20 degrees stub teeth, and 2. Number of teeth and pitch
circle diameter of each gear. Assume suitable values of velocity factor and Lewis factor.
Solution. Given : L = 500 mm ; NM = 900 r.p.m. ; NC = 200 r.p.m. ; T = 5000 N-m ; Tmax = 1.25 T
1. Module and face width of the gears
Let
m = Module in mm, and
b = Face width in mm.
Since the starting torque is 25% more than the normal torque, therefore the maximum torque,

In order to have the exact velocity ratio of 4.5, we shall take

∴Pitch circle diameter of the pinion,
DP = m × TP = 10 × 18 = 180 mm Ans.
and pitch circle diameter of the gear,
DG = m × TG = 10 × 81 = 810 mm Ans.
28.24 Spur Gear Construction
The gear construction may have different designs depending upon the size and its application.
When the dedendum circle diameter is slightly greater than the shaft diameter, then the pinion teeth
are cut integral with the shaft as shown in Fig. 28.13 (a). If the pitch circle diameter of the pinion is
less than or equal to 14.75 m + 60 mm (where m is the module in mm), then the pinion is made solid
with uniform thickness equal to the face width, as shown in Fig. 28.13 (b). Small gears upto 250 mm
pitch circle diameter are built with a web, which joins the hub and the rim. The web thickness is
generally equal to half the circular pitch or it may be taken as 1.6 m to 1.9 m, where m is the module.
The web may be made solid as shown in Fig. 28.13 (c) or may have recesses in order to reduce its
weight.

Spur Gears     1057
Large gears are provided with arms to join the hub and the rim, as shown in Fig. 28.14. The
number of arms depends upon the pitch circle diameter of the gear. The number of arms may be
selected from the following table.

The cross-section of the arms is most often elliptical, but other sections as shown in Fig. 28.15
may also be used.
Fig. 28.15. Cross-section of the arms.
The hub diameter is kept as 1.8 times the shaft diameter for steel gears, twice the shaft diameter
for cast iron gears and 1.65 times the shaft diameter for forged steel gears used for light service. The
length of the hub is kept as 1.25 times the shaft diameter for light service and should not be less than
the face width of the gear.
The thickness of the gear rim should be as small as possible, but to facilitate casting and to
avoid sharp changes of section, the minimum thickness of the rim is generally kept as half of the
circular pitch (or it may be taken as 1.6 m to 1.9 m, where m is the module). The thickness of rim (tR)
may also be calculated by using the following relation, i.e.
tR =
T
m
n
where
T = Number of teeth, and
n = Number of arms.
The rim should be provided with a circumferential rib of thickness equal to the rim thickness.

28.25 Design of Shaft for Spur Gears
In order to find the diameter of shaft for spur gears,
the following procedure may be followed.
1. First of all, find the normal load (WN), acting
between the tooth surfaces. It is given by
WN = WT / cos φ
where
WT = Tangential load, and
φ = Pressure angle.
A thrust parallel and equal to WN will act at the
gear centre as shown in Fig. 28.16.
2. The weight of the gear is given by
WG = 0.001 18 TG.b.m2 (in N)
where
TG = No. of teeth on the gear,
b = Face width in mm, and
m = Module in mm.

4. If the gear is overhung on the shaft, then bending moment on the shaft due to the resultant
load,
M = WR × x
where
x = Overhang i.e. the distance between the centre of gear and the centre
of bearing.
5. Since the shaft is under the combined effect of torsion and bending, therefore we shall
determine the equivalent torque. We know that equivalent torque,
Te =
2
2
M
T
+
where
T = Twisting moment = WT × DG / 2
6. Now the diameter of the gear shaft (d ) is determined by using the following relation, i.e.
Te = 16
d 3
π × τ ×
where
τ = Shear stress for the material of the gear shaft.
Note : Proceeding in the similar way as discussed above, we may calculate the diameter of the pinion shaft.
28.26 Design of Arms for Spur Gears
The cross-section of the arms is calculated by assuming them as a cantilever beam fixed at the
hub and loaded at the pitch circle. It is also assumed that the load is equally distributed to all the arms.
It may be noted that the arms are designed for the stalling load. The stalling load is a load that will
develop the maximum stress in the arms and in the teeth. This happens at zero velocity, when the
drive just starts operating.
The stalling load may be taken as the design tangential load divided by the velocity factor.

Example 28.7. A motor shaft rotating at 1500 r.p.m. has to transmit 15 kW to a low speed shaft
with a speed reduction of 3:1. The teeth are 
°
12
14 /  involute with 25 teeth on the pinion. Both the
pinion and gear are made of steel with a maximum safe stress of 200 MPa. A safe stress of 40 MPa
may be taken for the shaft on which the gear is mounted and for the key.
Design a spur gear drive to suit the above conditions. Also sketch the spur gear drive. Assume
starting torque to be 25% higher than the running torque.
Solution : Given : NP = 1500 r.p.m. ; P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W ; V.R. = TG/TP = 3 ; φ = 
12
14 °
/ ;
TP = 25 ; σOP = σOG = 200 MPa = 200 N/mm2 ; τ = 40 MPa = 40 N/mm2
Design for spur gears
Since the starting torque is 25% higher than the running torque, therefore the spur gears should
be designed for power,
P1 = 1.25 P = 1.25 × 15 × 103 = 18 750 W
We know that the gear reduction ratio (TG / TP) is 3. Therefore the number of teeth on the gear,
TG = 3 TP = 3 × 25 = 75
Let us assume that the module (m) for the pinion and gear is 6 mm.
∴Pitch circle diameter of the pinion,
DP = m.TP = 6 × 25 = 150 mm = 0.15 m
and pitch circle diameter of the gear,
DG = m. TG = 6 × 75 = 450 mm

    = (200 × 0.203) b × π × 6 × 0.0966 = 74 b
∴b = 1590 / 74 = 21.5 mm
In actual practice, the face width (b) is taken as
9.5 m to 12.5 m, but in certain cases, due to space
limitations, it may be taken as 6 m. Therefore let us
take the face width,

Bending moment on the shaft due to the resultant load,
M = WR × 100 = 1680 × 100 = 168 000 N-mm

Since the weight of the pinion (WP) is very small as compared to the normal load (WN), therefore it may be
neglected. Thus the resultant load acting on the pinion (WR) may be taken equal to WN.

29.1 Introduction
A helical gear has teeth in form of helix around the
gear. Two such gears may be used to connect two parallel
shafts in place of spur gears. The helixes may be right
handed on one gear and left handed on the other. The pitch
surfaces are cylindrical as in spur gearing, but the teeth
instead of being parallel to the axis, wind around the
cylinders helically like screw threads. The teeth of helical
gears with parallel axis have line contact, as in spur gearing.
This provides gradual engagement and continuous contact
of the engaging teeth. Hence helical gears give smooth drive
with a high efficiency of transmission.
We have already discussed in Art. 28.4 that the helical
gears may be of single helical type or double helical type.
In case of single helical gears there is some axial thrust
between the teeth, which is a disadvantage. In order to
eliminate this axial thrust, double helical gears (i.e.
Contents
Top
Helical Gears     1067
Fig. 29.1. Helical gear
(nomenclature).
herringbone gears) are used. It is equivalent to two single helical gears, in which equal and opposite
thrusts are provided on each gear and the resulting axial thrust is zero.
29.2 Terms used in Helical Gears
The following terms in connection with helical gears, as shown in
Fig. 29.1, are important from the subject point of view.
1. Helix angle. It is a constant angle made by the helices with the
axis of rotation.
2. Axial pitch. It is the distance, parallel to the axis, between similar
faces of adjacent teeth. It is the same as circular pitch and is therefore
denoted by pc. The axial pitch may also be defined as the circular pitch
in the plane of rotation or the diametral plane.
3. Normal pitch. It is the distance between similar faces of adjacent
teeth along a helix on the pitch cylinders normal to the teeth. It is denoted
by pN. The normal pitch may also be defined as the circular pitch in the normal plane which is a plane
perpendicular to the teeth. Mathematically, normal pitch,
pN = pc cos α
Note : If the gears are cut by standard hobs, then the pitch (or module) and the pressure angle of the hob will
apply in the normal plane. On the other hand, if the gears are cut by the Fellows gear-shaper method, the pitch
and pressure angle of the cutter will apply to the plane of rotation. The relation between the normal pressure
angle (φN) in the normal plane and the pressure angle (φ) in the diametral plane (or plane of rotation) is given by
tan φN = tan φ × cos α
29.3 Face Width of Helical Gears
In order to have more than one pair of teeth in contact, the tooth displacement (i.e. the ad-
vancement of one end of tooth over the other end) or overlap should be atleast equal to the axial
pitch, such that
Overlap = pc = b tan α
...(i)
The normal tooth load (WN) has two components ; one is tangential component (WT) and the
other axial component (WA), as shown in Fig. 29.2. The axial or end thrust is given by
WA = WN sin α = WT tan α
...(ii)
From equation (i), we see that as the helix angle increases, then the
tooth overlap increases. But at the same time, the end thrust as given by
equation (ii), also increases, which is undesirable. It is usually recom-
mended that the overlap should be 15 percent of the circular pitch.
∴
Overlap = b tan α = 1.15 pc

the module. In terms of pinion diameter (DP), the face width should be 1.5 DP to
2 DP, although 2.5 DP may be used.

3. In single helical gears, the helix angle ranges from 20° to 35°, while for double helical gears, it may be
made upto 45°.
29.4 Formative or Equivalent Number of Teeth for Helical Gears
The formative or equivalent number of teeth for a helical gear may be defined as the number of
teeth that can be generated on the surface of a cylinder having a radius equal to the radius of curvature
at a point at the tip of the minor axis of an ellipse obtained by taking a section of the gear in the normal
plane. Mathematically, formative or equivalent number of teeth on a helical gear,
TE = T / cos3 α
where
T = Actual number of teeth on a helical gear, and
α = Helix angle.
29.5 Proportions for Helical Gears
Though the proportions for helical gears are not standardised, yet the following are recommended
by American Gear Manufacturer's Association (AGMA).
Pressure angle in the plane of rotation,
φ = 15° to 25°
Helix angle,
 α = 20° to 45°

Dedendum

Helical Gears     1069
29.6 Strength of Helical Gears
In helical gears, the contact between mating teeth is gradual, starting at one end and moving
along the teeth so that at any instant the line of contact runs diagonally across the teeth. Therefore in
order to find the strength of helical gears, a modified Lewis equation is used. It is given by
WT = (σo × Cv) b.π m.y'
where
WT = Tangential tooth load,
σo = Allowable static stress,
Cv = Velocity factor,
b = Face width,
m = Module, and
y' = Tooth form factor or Lewis factor corresponding to the formative
or virtual or equivalent number of teeth.

Example 29.1. A pair of helical gears are to transmit 15 kW. The teeth are 20° stub in diametral
plane and have a helix angle of 45°. The pinion runs at 10 000 r.p.m. and has 80 mm pitch diameter.
The gear has 320 mm pitch diameter. If the gears are made of cast steel having allowable static
strength of 100 MPa; determine a suitable module and face width from static strength considerations
and check the gears for wear, given σes = 618 MPa.
Solution. Given : P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W; φ = 20° ; α = 45° ; NP = 10 000 r.p.m. ; DP = 80 mm
= 0.08 m ; DG = 320 mm = 0.32 m ; σOP = σOG = 100 MPa = 100 N/mm2 ; σes = 618 MPa = 618 N/mm2

Since the maximum face width (b) for helical gears may be taken as 12.5 m to 20 m, where m is
the module, therefore let us take
b = 12.5 m
We know that the tangential tooth load (WT),
358 = (σOP . Cv) b.π m.y'P
= (100 × 0.104) 12.5 m × π m (0.175 – 0.0037 m)
= 409 m2 (0.175 – 0.0037 m) = 72 m2 – 1.5 m3
Solving this expression by hit and trial method, we find that
m = 2.3 say 2.5 mm Ans.
and face width,
 b = 12.5 m = 12.5 × 2.5 = 31.25 say 32 mm Ans.

Since the maximum load for wear is much more than the tangential load on the tooth, therefore
the design is satisfactory from consideration of wear.
Example 29.2. A helical cast steel gear with 30° helix angle has to transmit 35 kW at 1500
r.p.m. If the gear has 24 teeth, determine the necessary module, pitch diameter and face width for 20°
full depth teeth. The static stress for cast steel may be taken as 56 MPa. The width of face may be
taken as 3 times the normal pitch. What would be the end thrust on the gear? The tooth factor for 20°
full depth involute gear may be taken as

Helical Gears     1073
Example 29.3. Design a pair of helical gears for transmitting 22 kW. The speed of the driver
gear is 1800 r.p.m. and that of driven gear is 600 r.p.m. The helix angle is 30° and profile is
corresponding to 20° full depth system. The driver gear has 24 teeth. Both the gears are made of cast
steel with allowable static stress as 50 MPa. Assume the face width parallel to axis as 4 times the
circular pitch and the overhang for each gear as 150 mm. The allowable shear stress for the shaft
material may be taken as 50 MPa. The form factor may be taken as 0.154 – 0.912 / TE, where TE is
the equivalent number of teeth. The velocity factor may be taken as

φ = 20° ; TP = 24 ; σo = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2 ; b = 4 pc ; Overhang = 150 mm ; τ = 50 MPa = 50 N/mm2

and length of the hub

Since the length of the hub should not be less than the face width, therefore let us take length of
the hub as 76 mm. Ans.
Note : Since the pitch circle diameter of the pinion is 144 mm, therefore the pinion should be provided with a
web. Let us take the thickness of the web as 1.8 m, where m is the module.
∴ Thickness of the web = 1.8 m = 1.8 × 6 = 10.8 say 12 mm Ans.

30.1 Introduction
The bevel gears are used for transmitting power at a
constant velocity ratio between two shafts whose axes
intersect at a certain angle. The pitch surfaces for the bevel
gear are frustums of cones. The two pairs of cones in contact
is shown in Fig. 30.1. The elements of the cones, as shown
in Fig. 30.1 (a), intersect at the point of intersection of the
axis of rotation. Since the radii of both the gears are
proportional to their distances from the apex, therefore the
cones may roll together without sliding. In Fig. 30.1 (b),
the elements of both cones do not intersect at the point of
shaft intersection. Consequently, there may be pure rolling
at only one point of contact and there must be tangential
sliding at all other points of contact. Therefore, these cones,
cannot be used as pitch surfaces because it is impossible to
have positive driving and sliding in the same direction at
the same time. We, thus, conclude that the elements of bevel

gear pitch cones and shaft axes must intersect at the same point.
Fig. 30.1. Pitch surface for bevel gears.
30.2 Classification of Bevel Gears
The bevel gears may be classified into the following types, depending upon the angles between
the shafts and the pitch surfaces.
1. Mitre gears. When equal bevel gears (having equal teeth and equal pitch angles) connect two
shafts whose axes intersect at right angle, as shown in Fig. 30.2 (a), then they are known as mitre gears.
2. Angular bevel gears. When the bevel gears connect two shafts whose axes intersect at an
angle other than a right angle, then they are known as angular bevel gears.
The bevel gear is used to change the  axis of rotational motion. By  using gears of differing
numbers of teeth, the speed of rotation can also be changed.

3. Crown bevel gears. When the bevel gears connect two shafts whose axes intersect at an angle
greater than a right angle and one of the bevel gears has a pitch angle of 90º, then it is known as a
crown gear. The crown gear corresponds to a rack in spur gearing, as shown in Fig. 30.2 (b).
Fig. 30.2. Classification of bevel gears.
4. Internal bevel gears. When the teeth on the bevel gear are cut on the inside of the pitch cone,
then they are known as internal bevel gears.
Note : The bevel gears may have straight or spiral teeth. It may be assumed, unless otherwise stated, that the
bevel gear has straight teeth and the axes of the shafts intersect at right angle.

two mating gears intersect each other.
3. Pitch angle. It is the angle made by the pitch line with the axis of the shaft. It is denoted by ‘θP’.

30.4 Determination of Pitch Angle for
Bevel Gears
Consider a pair of bevel gears in mesh, as
shown in Fig. 30.3.
Let   θP1 =   Pitch angle for the pinion,
θP2 =   Pitch angle for the gear,
θS =  Angle between the two shaft axes,
DP =  Pitch diameter of the pinion,
DG =  Pitch diameter of the gear, and

From Fig. 30.3, we find that
θS = θP1 + θP2      or     θP2 = θS – θP1
∴
sin θP2 = sin (θS – θP1) = sin θS . cos θP1 – cos θS . sin θP1

∴

From equations (i) and (ii), we have
V.R. × sin θP1 = sin θS . cos θP1 – cos θS . sin θP1
Dividing throughout by cos θP1 we get
V.R. tan θP1 = sin θS – cos θS. tan θP1

5. Thickness of tooth

where m is the module.
Note : Since the bevel gears are not interchangeable, therefore these are designed in pairs.
30.6  Formative or Equivalent Number of Teeth for Bevel Gears – Tredgold’s
Approximation
We have already discussed that the involute teeth for a spur gear may be generated by the edge
of a plane as it rolls on a base cylinder. A similar analysis for a bevel gear will show that a true section
of the resulting involute lies on the surface of a sphere. But it is not possible to represent on a plane
surface the exact profile of a bevel gear tooth lying on the surface of a sphere. Therefore, it is
important to approximate the bevel gear tooth profiles as accurately as possible. The approximation
(known as Tredgold’s approximation) is based upon the fact that a cone tangent to the sphere at the
pitch point will closely approximate the surface of the sphere for a short distance either side of the
pitch point, as shown in Fig. 30.4 (a). The cone (known as back cone) may be developed as a plane
surface and spur gear teeth corresponding to the pitch and pressure angle of the bevel gear and the
radius of the developed cone can be drawn. This procedure is shown in Fig. 30.4 (b).
Fig. 30.4
Let
θP = Pitch angle or half of the cone angle,
R = Pitch circle radius of the bevel pinion or gear, and
RB = Back cone distance or equivalent pitch circle radius of spur pinion
or gear.
Now from Fig. 30.4 (b), we find that
RB = R sec θP

Notes : 1. The action of bevel gears will be same as that of equivalent spur gears.
   2. Since the equivalent number of teeth is always greater than the actual number of teeth, therefore a
given pair of bevel gears will have a larger contact ratio. Thus, they will run more smoothly than a pair of spur
gears with the same number of teeth.
30.7 Strength of Bevel Gears
The strength of a bevel gear tooth is obtained in a similar way as discussed in the previous
articles. The modified form of the Lewis equation for the tangential tooth load is given as follows:

30.8 Forces Acting on a Bevel Gear
Consider a bevel gear and pinion in mesh as shown in Fig. 30.5. The normal force (WN) on the
tooth is perpendicular to the tooth profile and thus makes an angle equal to the pressure angle (φ) to
the pitch circle. Thus normal force can be resolved into two components, one is the tangential component
(WT) and the other is the radial component (WR). The tangential component (i.e. the tangential tooth
load) produces the bearing reactions while the radial component produces end thrust in the shafts.
The magnitude of the tangential and radial components is as follows :
WT = WN cos φ, and WR = WN sin φ = WT tan φ
...(i)
Contents

Now the radial force (WR) acting at the mean radius may be further resolved into two
components, WRH and WRV, in the axial and radial directions as shown in Fig. 30.5. Therefore the
axial force acting on the pinion shaft,
WRH = WR sin θP1 = WT tan φ . sin θP1
...[From equation (i)]
and the radial force acting on the pinion shaft,
WRV = WR cos θP1 = WT tan φ. cos θP1
Fig. 30.5. Forces acting on a bevel gear.
A little consideration will show that the axial force on the pinion shaft is equal to the radial force
on the gear shaft but their directions are opposite. Similarly, the radial force on the pinion shaft is
equal to the axial force on the gear shaft, but act in opposite directions.
30.9 Design of a Shaft for Bevel Gears
In designing a pinion shaft, the following procedure may be adopted :
1. First of all, find the torque acting on the pinion. It is given by
T =
P
60
2
P
N
×
π
 N-m
where
P = Power transmitted in watts, and
NP = Speed of the pinion in r.p.m.
2. Find the tangential force (WT) acting at the mean radius (Rm) of the pinion. We know that
WT = T / Rm
3. Now find the axial and radial forces (i.e. WRH and WRV) acting on the pinion shaft as
discussed above.
4. Find resultant bending moment on the pinion shaft as follows :
The bending moment due to WRH and WRV is given by
M1 = WRV × Overhang – WRH × Rm
and bending moment due to WT,
M2 = WT × Overhang

∴  Resultant bending moment,

5. Since the shaft is subjected to twisting moment (T ) and resultant bending moment (M),
therefore equivalent twisting moment,

6. Now the diameter of the pinion shaft may be obtained by using the torsion equation. We
know that
Te = 16
π  × τ (dP)3
where
dP = Diameter of the pinion shaft, and
τ = Shear stress for the material of the pinion shaft.
7. The same procedure may be adopted to find the diameter of the gear shaft.
Example 30.1.  A 35 kW motor running at 1200 r.p.m. drives a compressor at 780 r.p.m.
through a 90° bevel gearing arrangement. The pinion has 30 teeth. The pressure angle of teeth is

, where TE is the number of teeth
equivalent of a spur gear.
The face width may be taken as 1

slant height of pitch cone. Determine for the
pinion, the module pitch, face width, addendum,
dedendum, outside diameter and slant height.
Solution : Given : P = 35 kW = 35 × 103

Module and face width for the pinion

Example 30.2. A pair of cast iron bevel gears connect two shafts at right angles. The pitch
diameters of the pinion and gear are 80 mm and 100 mm respectively. The tooth profiles of the gears
are of 14 1/2º composite form. The allowable static stress for both the gears is 55 MPa. If the pinion
transmits 2.75 kW at 1100 r.p.m., find the module and number of teeth on each gear from the stand-
point of strength and check the design from the standpoint of wear. Take surface endurance limit as
630 MPa and modulus of elasticity for cast iron as 84 kN/mm2.

and pitch angle for the gear,

We know that formative number of teeth for the pinion,
TEP = TP . sec θP1 = 21 sec 19.3º = 22.26
and formative number of teeth for the gear,
TEG = TG . sec θP2 = 60 sec 70.7º = 181.5

∴
σOP × y'P = 85 × 0.093 = 7.905

From Table 28.8, we find that flexural endurance limit (σe) for the gear material which is grey
cast iron having B.H.N. = 160, is
σe = 84 MPa = 84 N/mm2
We know that the static tooth load or endurance strength of the tooth,
WS = σe.b.π m.y'G = 84 × 54 × π × 5 × 0.12 = 8552 N
Since WS is less that WD, therefore the design is not satisfactory from the standpoint of dynamic
load. We have already discussed in spur gears (Art. 28.20) that WS ≥ 1.25 WD for steady loads. For
a satisfactory design against dynamic load, let us take the precision gears having tooth error in action
(e = 0.015 mm) for a module of 5 mm.

satisfactory, from the standpoint of dynamic load.

We know that maximum or limiting load for wear,

Since Ww is greater then WD, therefore the design is satisfactory from the standpoint of wear.
Example 30.4. A pair of 20º full depth
involute teeth bevel gears connect two shafts
at right angles having velocity ratio 3 : 1.
The gear is made of cast steel having
allowable static stress as 70 MPa and the
pinion is of steel with allowable static stress

Let

31.1 Introduction
The worm gears are widely used for transmitting
power at high velocity ratios between non-intersecting
shafts that are generally, but not necessarily, at right angles.
It can give velocity ratios as high as 300 : 1 or more in a
single step in a minimum of space, but it has a lower
efficiency. The worm gearing is mostly used as a speed
reducer, which consists of worm and a worm wheel or
gear. The worm (which is the driving member) is usually
of a cylindrical form having threads of the same shape as
that of an involute rack. The threads of the worm may be
left handed or right handed and single or multiple threads.
The worm wheel or gear (which is the driven member) is
similar to a helical gear with a face curved to conform to
the shape of the worm. The worm is generally made of
steel while the worm gear is made of bronze or cast iron
for light service.
Contents
Top
1102    A Textbook of Machine Design
The worm gearing is classified as non-interchangeable, because a worm wheel cut with a hob of
one diameter will not operate satisfactorily with a worm of different diameter, even if the thread pitch
is same.
31.2 Types of Worms
The following are the two types of worms :
1. Cylindrical or straight worm, and
2. Cone or double enveloping worm.
The cylindrical or straight worm, as shown in Fig. 31.1 (a), is most commonly used. The shape
of the thread is involute helicoid of pressure angle 14 ½° for single and double threaded worms and
20° for triple and quadruple threaded worms. The worm threads are cut by a straight sided milling
cutter having its diameter not less than the outside diameter of worm or greater than 1.25 times the
outside diameter of worm.
The cone or double enveloping worm, as shown in Fig. 31.1 (b), is used to some extent, but it
requires extremely accurate alignment.
Fig. 31.1. Types of worms.
31.3 Types of Worm Gears
The following three types of worm gears are important from the subject point of view :
1. Straight face worm gear, as shown in Fig. 31.2 (a),
2. Hobbed straight face worm gear, as shown in Fig. 31.2 (b), and
3. Concave face worm gear, as shown in Fig. 31.2 (c).
Fig. 31.2. Types of worms gears.
The straight face worm gear is like a helical gear in which the straight teeth are cut with a form
cutter. Since it has only point contact with the worm thread, therefore it is used for light service.
The hobbed straight face worm gear is also used for light service but its teeth are cut with a
hob, after which the outer surface is turned.
Contents
Top
Worm Gears    1103
The concave face worm gear is the accepted standard form and is used for all heavy service and
general industrial uses. The teeth of this gear are cut with a hob of the same pitch diameter as the
mating worm to increase the contact area.
31.4 Terms used in Worm Gearing
The worm and worm gear in mesh is shown in Fig. 31.3.
The following terms, in connection with the worm gearing, are important from the subject point
of view :
1. Axial pitch. It is also known as linear pitch of a worm. It is the distance measured axially
(i.e. parallel to the axis of worm) from a point on one thread to the corresponding point on the
adjacent thread on the worm, as shown in Fig. 31.3. It may be noted that the axial pitch (pa) of a worm
is equal to the circular pitch (  pc ) of the mating worm gear, when the shafts are at right angles.
Fig. 31.3 . Worm and Worm gear.
Worm gear is used mostly where the power source operates at a high speed and output is at a slow
speed with high torque. It is also used in some cars and trucks.
Contents
Top
1104    A Textbook of Machine Design
2. Lead. It is the linear distance through which a point on a thread moves ahead in one
revolution of the worm. For single start threads, lead is equal to the axial pitch, but for multiple start
threads, lead is equal to the product of axial pitch and number of starts. Mathematically,
Lead,
 l = pa . n
where
 pa = Axial pitch ; and n = Number of starts.
3. Lead angle. It is the angle between the tangent to the thread helix on the pitch cylinder and
the plane normal to the axis of the worm. It is denoted by λ.
A little consideration will show that if one complete
turn of a worm thread be imagined to be unwound from
the body of the worm, it will form an inclined plane whose
base is equal to the pitch circumference of the worm and
altitude equal to lead of the worm, as shown in Fig. 31.4.
From the geometry of the figure, we find that

The lead angle (λ) may vary from 9° to 45°. It has been shown by F.A. Halsey that a lead angle
less than 9° results in rapid wear and the safe value of λ is 12½°.

where NG is the speed of the worm gear and NW is the speed of the worm.
4. Tooth pressure angle. It is measured in a plane containing the axis of the worm and is equal
to one-half the thread profile angle as shown in Fig. 31.3.
The following table shows the recommended values of lead angle (λ) and tooth pressure
angle (φ).

For automotive applications, the
pressure angle of 30° is recommended
to obtain a high efficiency and to per-
mit overhauling.
5. Normal pitch. It is the distance
measured along the normal to the threads
between two corresponding points on
two adjacent threads of the worm.
Mathematically,
Normal pitch, pN  = pa.cos λ
Note. The term normal pitch is used for a
worm having single start threads. In case of a
worm having multiple start threads, the term
normal lead (lN) is used, such that
                  lN  = l . cos λ
6. Helix angle. It is the angle
between the tangent to the thread helix on the pitch cylinder and the axis of the worm. It is denoted by
αW, in Fig. 31.3. The worm helix angle is the complement of worm lead angle, i.e.
          αW + λ = 90°
It may be noted that the helix angle on the worm is generally quite large and that on the worm
gear is very small. Thus, it is usual to specify the lead angle (λ) on the worm and helix angle (αG) on
the worm gear. These two angles are equal for a 90° shaft angle.
7. Velocity ratio. It is the ratio of the speed of worm (NW) in r.p.m. to the speed of the worm gear
(NG) in r.p.m. Mathematically, velocity ratio,
              V.R.   =

Note : If the efficiency of worm gearing is less
than 50%, then the worm gearing is said to be
self locking, i.e. it cannot be driven by applying
a torque to the wheel. This property of self
locking is desirable in some applications such
as hoisting machinery.
Example 31.1. A triple threaded
worm has teeth of 6 mm module and pitch
circle diameter of 50 mm. If the worm gear
has 30 teeth of 14½° and the coefficient of

31.8  Strength of Worm Gear Teeth
In finding the tooth size and strength, it is safe to assume that the teeth of worm gear are always
weaker than the threads of the worm. In worm gearing, two or more teeth are usually in contact, but
due to uncertainty of load distribution among themselves it is assumed that the load is transmitted by
one tooth only. We know that according to Lewis equation,
WT = (σo . Cv) b. π m . y
where
 WT = Permissible tangential tooth load or beam strength of gear tooth,
σo = Allowable static stress,
Cv = Velocity factor,
b = Face width,
m = Module, and
y = Tooth form factor or Lewis factor.
Notes : 1. The velocity factor is given by
Cv =

v

 where v is the peripheral velocity of the worm gear in m/s.
2. The tooth form factor or Lewis factor (y) may be obtained in the similar manner as discussed in spur

The dynamic load need not to be calculated because it is
not so severe due to the sliding action between the worm and
worm gear.
4. The static tooth load or endurance strength of the tooth
(WS) may also be obtained in the similar manner as discussed
in spur gears (Art. 28.20), i.e.

value may be taken as 84 MPa

31.10 Thermal Rating of Worm Gearing
In the worm gearing, the heat generated due to the work lost in friction must be dissipated in
order to avoid over heating of the drive and lubricating oil. The quantity of heat generated (Qg) is
given by
Qg = Power lost in friction in watts = P (1 – η)
...(i)
where
P = Power transmitted in watts, and
η = Efficiency of the worm gearing.
The heat generated must be dissipated through the lubricating oil to the gear box housing and
then to the atmosphere. The heat dissipating capacity depends upon the following factors :
1. Area of the housing (A),
2. Temperature difference between the housing surface and surrounding air (t2 – t1), and
3. Conductivity of the material (K).
Mathematically, the heat dissipating capacity,
Qd = A (t2 – t1) K
...(ii)
From equations (i) and (ii), we can find the temperature difference (t2 – t1). The average value
of K may be taken as 378 W/m2/°C.
Notes : 1. The maximum temperature (t2 – t1) should not exceed 27 to 38°C.
2. The maximum temperature of the lubricant should not exceed 60°C.
3. According to AGMA recommendations, the limiting input power of a plain worm gear unit from the
standpoint of heat dissipation, for worm gear speeds upto 2000 r.p.m., may be checked from the following
relation, i.e.
P =

31.11 Forces Acting on Worm Gears
When the worm gearing is transmitting power, the forces acting on the worm are similar to those
on a power screw. Fig. 31.5 shows the forces acting on the worm. It may be noted that the forces on
a worm gear are equal in magnitude to that of worm, but opposite in direction to those shown in
Fig. 31.5.
Fig. 31.5. Forces acting on worm teeth.
The various forces acting on the worm may be determined as follows :
1. Tangential force on the worm,
WT =
W
2
Torque on worm
Pitch circle diameter of worm (
)
D
×
= Axial force or thrust on the worm gear
The tangential force (WT) on the worm produces a twisting moment of magnitude (WT × DW / 2)
and bends the worm in the horizontal plane.
2. Axial force or thrust on the worm,
WA = WT  /  tan λ = Tangential force on the worm gear
=
G
2
Torque on the worm gear
Pitch circle diameter of worm gear(
)
D
×
The axial force on the worm tends to move the worm axially, induces an axial load on the
bearings and bends the worm in a vertical plane with a bending moment of magnitude (WA × DW / 2).
3. Radial or separating force on the worm,
WR = WA . tan φ = Radial or separating force on the worm gear
The radial or separating force tends to force the worm and worm gear out of mesh. This force
also bends the worm in the vertical plane.
Example 31.2. A worm drive transmits 15 kW at 2000 r.p.m. to a machine carriage at 75 r.p.m.
The worm is triple threaded and has 65 mm pitch diameter. The worm gear has 90 teeth of 6 mm
module. The tooth form is to be 20° full depth involute. The coefficient of friction between the mating
teeth may be taken as 0.10. Calculate : 1. tangential force acting on the worm ; 2. axial thrust and
separating force on worm; and 3. efficiency of the worm drive.
Solution. Given : P = 15 kW = 15 × 103 W ; NW = 2000 r.p.m. ; NG = 75 r.p.m. ; n = 3 ;
DW = 65 mm ; TG = 90 ; m = 6 mm ; φ = 20° ; μ = 0.10

31.12 Design of Worm Gearing
In designing a worm and worm gear, the quantities like the power transmitted, speed, velocity
ratio and the centre distance between the shafts are usually given and the quantities such as lead
angle, lead and number of threads on the worm are to be determined. In order to determine the
satisfactory combination of lead angle, lead and centre distance, the following method may be used:
From Fig. 31.6 we find that the centre distance,

Since the velocity ratio (V.R.) is usually given, therefore the equation (i) contains three variables
i.e. x, lN and λ. The right hand side of the above expression may be calculated for various values of
velocity ratios and the curves are plotted as shown in Fig. 31.7. The lowest point on each of the curves
gives the lead angle which corresponds to the minimum value of x / lN. This minimum value repre-
sents the minimum centre distance that can be used with a given lead or inversely the maximum lead
that can be used with a given centre distance. Now by using Table 31.2 and standard modules, we can
determine the combination of lead angle, lead, centre distance and diameters for the given design
specifications.

Solution. Given : φ = 20° ; P = 10 kW = 10 000 W ; NW = 1400 r.p.m. ; V.R.= 12 ; x = 225 mm

We have discussed in Art. 31.12 that the value of x / lN will be minimum corresponding to

∴
lN = 225 / 2.5 = 90 mm
and 
axial lead,

From Table 31.2, we find that for a velocity ratio of 12, the number of starts or threads on the
worm,
n = TW = 4
∴ Axial pitch of the threads on the worm,
pa = l / 4 = 98.2 / 4 = 24.55 mm
∴
m = pa / π = 24.55 / π = 7.8 mm
Let us take the standard value of module, m = 8 mm
∴ Axial pitch of the threads on the worm,
pa = π m = p × 8 = 25.136 mm Ans.
Axial lead of the threads on the worm,
l = pa . n = 25.136 × 4 = 100.544 mm Ans.

Worm Gears    1115
Since the velocity ratio is 12 and the worm has quadruple threads (i.e. n = TW = 4), therefore
number of teeth on the worm gear,
TG = 12 × 4 = 48
From Table 31.3, we find that the face length of the worm or the length of threaded portion is
LW = pc (4.5 + 0.02 TW)
= 25.136 (4.5 + 0.02 × 4) = 115 mm
...(Q pc = pa)
This length should be increased by 25 to 30 mm for the feed marks produced by the vibrating
grinding wheel as it leaves the thread root. Therefore let us take
LW = 140 mm Ans.
We know that depth of tooth,
h = 0.623 pc = 0.623 × 25.136 = 15.66 mm Ans.
...(From Table 31.3)
and
addendum,
 a = 0.286 pc = 0.286 × 25.136 = 7.2 mm Ans.
∴ Outside diameter of worm,
DOW = DW + 2a = 73.24 + 2 × 7.2 = 87.64 mm Ans.
2. Design of worm gear
We know that pitch circle diameter of the worm gear,
DG = m . TG = 8 × 48 = 384 mm = 0.384 m Ans.
From Table 31.4, we find that outside diameter of worm gear,
DOG = DG + 0.8903 pc = 384 + 0.8903 × 25.136 = 406.4 mm Ans.
Throat diameter,
DT = DG + 0.572 pc = 384 + 0.572 × 25.136 = 398.4 mm Ans.
and face width,
b = 2.15 pc + 5 mm = 2.15 × 25.136 + 5 = 59 mm Ans.
Let us now check the designed worm gearing from the standpoint of tangential load, dynamic
load, static load or endurance strength, wear load and heat dissipation.

Since the worm gear is generally made of phosphor bronze, therefore taking the allowable static
stress for phosphor bronze, σo = 84 MPa or N/mm2.
We know that the designed tangential load,
WT = (σo . Cv) b. π m . y = (84 × 0.72) 59 × π × 8 × 0.135 N
= 12 110 N
Since this is more than the tangential load acting on the gear (i.e. 4260 N), therefore the design
is safe from the standpoint of tangential load.
(b)  Check for dynamic load
We know that the dynamic load,
WD = WT / Cv = 12 110 / 0.72 = 16 820 N
Since this is more than WT = 4260 N, therefore the design is safe from the standpoint of
dynamic load.
(c)  Check for static load or endurance strength
We know that the flexural endurance limit for phosphor bronze is
σe = 168 MPa or N/mm2
∴ Static load or endurance strength,
WS = σe . b. π m . y = 168 × 59 × π × 8 × 0.135 = 33 635 N
Since this is much more than WT = 4260 N, therefore the design is safe from the standpoint of
static load or endurance strength.
(d)  Check for wear
Assuming the material for worm as hardened steel, therefore from Table 31.5, we find that for
hardened steel worm and phosphor bronze worm gear, the value of load stress factor,
K = 0.55 N/mm2
Gears are usually enclosed in boxes to protect them from environmental
pollution and provide them proper lubrication.

∴ Limiting or maximum load for wear,
WW = DG . b . K = 384 × 59 × 0.55 = 12 461 N
Since this is more than WT = 4260 N, therefore the design is safe from the standpoint of wear.

First of all, let us find the efficiency of the worm gearing (η).

We know that heat dissipating capacity,
Qd = A (t2 – t1) K = 120 041 × 10–6 (t2 – t1) 378 = 45.4 (t2 – t1)
The heat generated must be dissipated in order to avoid over heating of the drive, therefore
equating Qg = Qd, we have
t2 – t1 = 1375 / 45.4 = 30.3°C
Since this temperature difference (t2 – t1) is within safe limits of 27 to 38°C, therefore the design
is safe from the standpoint of heat.

Worm Gears    1121
Since the centre distance between the shafts is not known, therefore let us assume that for this
size unit, the centre distance (x) = 100 mm.

∴ Pitch circle diameter of the worm gear,

From Table 31.2, we find that for the transmission ratio of 27, we shall use double start
worms.
∴ Number of teeth on the worm gear,
TG = 2 × 27 = 54
We know that the axial pitch of the threads on the worm (pa) is equal to circular pitch of teeth on
the worm gear ( pc).

and actual pitch circle diameter of the worm,

The face width of the worm gear (b) may be taken as 0.73 times the pitch circle diameter of
worm (DW).
∴
b = 0.73 DW = 0.73 × 38 = 27.7 say 28 mm
Let us now check the design from the standpoint of tangential load, dynamic load, static load or
endurance strength, wear load and heat dissipation.

From Table 31.4, we find that allowable static stress for phosphor bronze is
σo = 84 MPa or N/mm2
∴ Tangential load transmitted,
WT = (σo . Cv) b . π m . y = (84 × 0.93) 28 × π × 3 × 0.137 N
= 2825 N
and power transmitted due to the tangential load,
P = WT × v = 2825 × 0.452 = 1277 W = 1.277 kW
Since this power is more than the given power to be transmitted (1.1 kW), therefore the design
is safe from the standpoint of tangential load.
2. Check for the dynamic load
We know that the dynamic load,
WD = WT / Cv = 2825 / 0.93 = 3038 N
and power transmitted due to the dynamic laod,
P = WD × v = 3038 × 0.452 = 1373 W = 1.373 kW
Since this power is more than the given power to be transmitted, therefore the design is safe
from the standpoint of dynamic load.
3. Check for the static load or endurance strength
From Table 31.8, we find that the flexural endurance limit for phosphor bronze is
σe = 168 MPa or N/mm2
∴ Static load or endurance strength,
WS = σe . b. π m . y = 168 × 28 × π  × 3 × 0.137 = 6075 N
and power transmitted due to the static load,
P = WS × v = 6075 × 0.452 = 2746 W = 2.746 kW
Since this power is more than the power to be transmitted (1.1 kW), therefore the design is safe
from the standpoint of static load.
4. Check for the wear load
From Table 31.5, we find that the load stress factor for hardened steel worm and phosphor
bronze worm gear is
K = 0.55 N/mm2
∴ Limiting or maximum load for wear,
WW = DG . b . K = 162 × 28 × 0.55 = 2495 N
and power transmitted due to the wear load,
P = WW × v = 2495 × 0.452 = 1128 W = 1.128 kW
Since this power is more than the given power to be transmitted (1.1 kW), therefore the design
is safe from the standpoint of wear.
5. Check for the heat dissipation
We know that permissible input power,

32.1 Introduction
As the name implies, the internal combustion engines
(briefly written as I. C. engines) are those engines in which
the combustion of fuel takes place inside the engine cylinder.
The I.C. engines use either petrol or diesel as their fuel. In
petrol engines (also called spark ignition engines or S.I
engines), the correct proportion of air and petrol is mixed
in the carburettor and fed to engine cylinder where it is
ignited by means of a spark produced at the spark plug. In
diesel engines (also called compression ignition engines
or C.I engines), only air is supplied to the engine cylinder
during suction stroke and it is compressed to a very high
pressure, thereby raising its temperature from 600°C to
1000°C. The desired quantity of fuel (diesel) is now injected
into the engine cylinder in the form of a very fine spray and
gets ignited when comes in contact with the hot air.
The operating cycle of an I.C. engine may be
completed either by the two strokes or four strokes of the
Contents
Top
1126    A Textbook of Machine Design
piston. Thus, an engine which requires two strokes of the piston or one complete revolution of the
crankshaft to complete the cycle, is known as two stroke engine. An engine which requires four
strokes of the piston or two complete revolutions of the crankshaft to complete the cycle, is known as
four stroke engine.
The two stroke petrol engines are generally employed in very light vehicles such as scooters,
motor cycles and three wheelers. The two stroke diesel engines are generally employed in marine
propulsion.
The four stroke petrol engines are generally employed in light vehicles such as cars, jeeps and
also in aeroplanes. The four stroke diesel engines are generally employed in heavy duty vehicles such
as buses, trucks, tractors, diesel locomotive and in the earth moving machinery.
32.2 Principal Parts of an Engine
The principal parts of an I.C engine, as shown in Fig. 32.1 are as follows :
1. Cylinder and cylinder liner, 2. Piston, piston rings and piston pin or gudgeon pin, 3. Connecting
rod with small and big end bearing, 4. Crank, crankshaft and crank pin, and 5. Valve gear mechanism.
The design of the above mentioned principal parts are discussed, in detail, in the following
pages.
Fig. 32.1. Internal combustion engine parts.
32.3 Cylinder and Cylinder Liner
The function of a cylinder is to retain the working fluid and to guide the piston. The cylinders
are usually made of cast iron or cast steel. Since the cylinder has to withstand high temperature due to
the combustion of fuel, therefore, some arrangement must be provided to cool the cylinder. The
single cylinder engines (such as scooters and motorcycles) are generally air cooled. They are provided
with fins around the cylinder. The multi-cylinder engines (such as of cars) are provided with water
jackets around the cylinders to cool it. In smaller engines. the cylinder, water jacket and the frame are
Contents

Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1127
made as one piece, but for all the larger engines, these parts are manufactured separately. The cylinders
are provided with cylinder liners so that in case of wear, they can be easily replaced. The cylinder
liners are of the following two types :
1. Dry liner, and  2. Wet liner.
Fig. 32.2. Dry and wet liner.
A cylinder liner which does not have any direct contact with the engine cooling water, is known
as dry liner, as shown in Fig. 32.2 (a). A cylinder liner which have its outer surface in direct contact
with the engine cooling water, is known as wet liner, as shown in Fig. 32.2 (b).
The cylinder liners are made from good quality close grained cast iron (i.e. pearlitic cast iron),
nickel cast iron, nickel chromium cast iron. In some cases, nickel chromium cast steel with molybdenum
may be used. The inner surface of the liner should be properly heat-treated in order to obtain a hard
surface to reduce wear.
32.4 Design of a Cylinder
In designing a cylinder for an I. C. engine, it is required to determine the following values :
1. Thickness of the cylinder wall. The cylinder wall is subjected to gas pressure and the piston
side thrust. The gas pressure produces the following two types of stresses :
(a) Longitudinal stress, and (b) Circumferential stress.
The above picture shows crankshaft, pistons  and cylinder of a 4-stroke petrol engine.
Oil is pumped up into
cylinders to lubricate pistons
Sump is filled with oil to
reduce friction

electricity to spark plugs.

Top
1128    A Textbook of Machine Design
Since these two stressess act at right angles to each other, therefore, the net stress in each
direction is reduced.
The piston side thrust tends to bend the cylinder wall, but the stress in the wall due to side thrust
is very small and hence it may be neglected.
Let
D0 = Outside diameter of the cylinder in mm,
D = Inside diameter of the cylinder in mm,
p = Maximum pressure inside the engine cylinder in N/mm2,
t = Thickness of the cylinder wall in mm, and
1/m = Poisson’s ratio. It is usually taken as 0.25.

The allowance for reboring (C ) depending upon the cylinder bore (D) for I. C. engines is given
in the following table :

The thickness of the cylinder wall usually varies from 4.5 mm to 25 mm or more depending
upon the size of the cylinder. The thickness of the cylinder wall (t) may also be obtained from the
following empirical relation, i.e.
t = 0.045 D + 1.6 mm
The other empirical relations are as follows :
Thickness of the dry liner

smaller cylinders
Water space between the outer cylinder wall and inner jacket wall
= 10 mm for a 75 mm cylinder to 75 mm for a 750 mm cylinder
or  0.08 D +  6.5 mm
2. Bore and length of the cylinder. The bore (i.e. inner diameter) and length of the cylinder may
be determined as discussed below :
Let
pm = Indicated mean effective pressure in N/mm2,
D = Cylinder bore in mm,
A = Cross-sectional area of the cylinder in mm2,
= π D2/4
l = Length of stroke in metres,
N = Speed of the engine in r.p.m., and
n = Number of working strokes per min
= N, for two stroke engine
= N/2, for four stroke engine.
We know that the power produced inside the engine cylinder, i.e. indicated power,

From this expression, the bore (D) and length of stroke (l) is determined. The length of stroke is
generally taken as 1.25 D to 2D.
Since there is a clearance on both sides of the cylinder, therefore length of the cylinder is taken
as 15 percent greater than the length of stroke. In other words,
Length of the cylinder, L = 1.15 × Length of stroke = 1.15 l

of the engine is known, then

(b) The maximum gas pressure ( p ) may be taken as 9 to 10 times the mean effective pressure ( pm).
3. Cylinder flange and studs. The cylinders are cast integral with the upper half of the crank-
case or they are attached to the crankcase by means of a flange with studs or bolts and nuts. The
cylinder flange is integral with the cylinder and should be made thicker than the cylinder wall. The
flange thickness should be taken as 1.2 t to 1.4 t, where t is the thickness of cylinder wall.
The diameter of the studs or bolts may be obtained by equating the gas load due to the maximum
pressure in the cylinder to the resisting force offered by all the studs or bolts. Mathematically,

= Allowable tensile stress for the material of studs or bolts in MPa or
N/mm2. It may be taken as 35 to 70 MPa.
The nominal or major diameter of the stud or bolt (d ) usually lies between 0.75 tf  to  tf, where
tf is the thickness of flange. In no case, a stud or bolt less than 16 mm diameter should be used.
The distance of the flange from the centre of the hole for the stud or bolt should not be less than
d + 6 mm and not more than 1.5 d, where d is the nominal diameter of the stud or bolt.
In order to make a leak  proof  joint, the pitch of the studs or bolts should lie between 19 d  to
28.5
,
d  where d is in mm.
4. Cylinder head. Usually, a separate cylinder head or cover is provided with most of the engines.
It is, usually, made of box type section of considerable depth to accommodate ports for air and gas
passages, inlet valve, exhaust valve and spark plug (in case of petrol engines) or atomiser at the centre
of the cover (in case of diesel engines).
 The cylinder head may be approximately taken as a flat circular plate whose thickness (th) may
be determined from the following relation :
th =

where
D = Cylinder bore in mm,
p = Maximum pressure inside the cylinder in N/mm2,
c
σ
= Allowable circumferential stress in MPa or N/mm2. It may be taken
as 30 to 50 MPa, and
C = Constant whose value is taken as 0.1.
The studs or bolts are screwed up tightly alongwith a metal gasket or asbestos packing to provide
a leak proof joint between the cylinder and cylinder head. The tightness of the joint also depends
upon the pitch of the bolts or studs, which should lie between 19 d  to 28.5
.
d  The pitch circle
diameter (Dp) is usually taken as D + 3d. The studs or bolts are designed in the same way as discussed
above.
Example 32.1. A four stroke diesel engine has the following specifications :

2. Thickness of the cylinder head
Since the maximum pressure ( p) in the engine cylinder is taken as 9 to 10 times the mean
effective pressure ( pm), therefore let us take

32.5 Piston
The piston is a disc which reciprocates within a cylinder. It is either moved by the fluid or it
moves the fluid which enters the cylinder. The main function of the piston of an  internal combustion
engine is to receive the impulse from the expanding gas and to transmit the energy to the crankshaft
through the connecting rod. The piston must also disperse a large amount of heat from the combustion
chamber to the cylinder walls.

Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1133
The piston of internal combustion engines are usually of trunk type as shown in Fig. 32.3. Such
pistons are open at one end and consists of the following parts :
1. Head or crown. The piston head or crown may be flat, convex or concave depending upon
the design of combustion chamber. It withstands the pressure of gas in the cylinder.
2. Piston rings. The piston rings are used to seal the cyliner in order to prevent leakage of the
gas past the piston.
3. Skirt. The skirt acts as a bearing for the side thrust of the connecting rod on the walls of
cylinder.
4. Piston pin. It is also called gudgeon pin or wrist pin. It is used to connect the piston to the
connecting rod.
32.6 Design Considerations  for a Piston
In designing a piston for I.C. engine, the following points should be taken into consideration :
1. It should have enormous strength to withstand the high gas pressure and inertia forces.
2. It should have minimum mass to minimise the inertia forces.
3. It should form an effective gas and oil sealing of the cylinder.
4. It should provide sufficient   bearing area to prevent undue wear.
5. It should disprese the heat of combustion quickly to the cylinder walls.
6. It should have high speed reciprocation without noise.
7. It should be of sufficient rigid construction to withstand  thermal and mechanical distortion.
8. It should have sufficient support for the piston pin.
32.7 Material for Pistons
The most commonly used materials for pistons of I.C. engines are cast iron, cast aluminium,
forged aluminium, cast steel and forged steel. The cast iron pistons are used for moderately rated
Twin cylinder airplane engine of 1930s.

engines with piston speeds below 6 m / s and aluminium alloy pistons are used for highly rated en-
gines running at higher  piston sppeds. It may be noted that
1. Since the *coefficient of thermal expansion for aluminium is about 2.5 times that of cast iron,
therefore, a greater clearance must be provided between the piston and the cylinder wall (than with
cast iron piston) in order to prevent siezing of the piston when engine runs continuously under heavy
loads. But if excessive clearance is allowed, then the piston will develop ‘piston slap’ while it is cold
and this tendency increases with wear. The less clearance between the piston and the cylinder wall
will lead to siezing of piston.
2. Since the aluminium alloys used for pistons have high **heat conductivity (nearly four
times that of cast iron), therefore, these pistons ensure high rate of heat transfer and thus keeps
down the maximum temperature difference between the centre and edges of the piston head or
crown.
Notes: (a) For a cast iron piston, the temperature at the centre of the piston head (TC) is about 425°C to 450°C
under full load conditions and the temperature at the edges of the piston head (TE) is about 200°C to 225°C.
(b) For aluminium alloy pistons, TC is about 260°C to 290°C and  TE is about 185°C to 215°C.
3. Since the aluminium alloys are about ***three times lighter than cast iron, therfore, its
mechanical strength is good at low temperatures, but they lose their strength (about 50%) at temperatures
above  325°C. Sometimes, the pistons of aluminium alloys are coated with aluminium oxide by an
electrical method.
32.8 Piston Head or Crown
The piston head or crown is designed keeping in view the following two main considerations, i.e.
1. It should have adequate strength  to withstand the straining action due to pressure of explosion
inside the engine cylinder, and
2. It should dissipate the heat of combustion to the cylinder walls as quickly as possible.
On the basis of first consideration of straining action, the thickness of the piston head is determined
by treating it as a flat circular plate of uniform thickness, fixed at the outer edges and subjected to a
uniformly distributed load due to the gas pressure over the entire cross-section.
The thickness of the piston head (tH ), according to Grashoff’s formula is given by
tH =

where
p = Maximum gas pressure or explosion pressure in N/mm2,
D = Cylinder bore or outside diameter of the piston in mm, and
σt = Permissible bending (tensile) stress for the material of the piston in
MPa or N/mm2. It may be taken as 35 to 40 MPa for grey cast iron,
50 to 90 MPa for nickel cast iron and aluminium alloy and 60 to
100 MPa for forged steel.
On the basis of second consideration of heat transfer, the thickness of the piston head should be
such that the heat absorbed by the piston due combustion of fuel is quickly transferred to the cylinder
walls. Treating the piston head as a  flat ciucular plate, its thickness is given by
tH =

The heat conductivity for aluminium is 174.75 W/m/°C and for cast iron it is 46.6 W/m /°C.

where
H = Heat flowing through the piston head in kJ/s or watts,
k = Heat conductivity factor in W/m/°C. Its value is 46.6 W/m/°C for
grey cast iron, 51.25 W/m/°C for steel and 174.75 W/m/°C for
aluminium alloys.
TC = Temperture at the centre of the piston head in °C, and
TE = Temperature at the edges of the piston head in °C.
The temperature difference (TC – TE)  may be taken as 220°C for cast iron and 75°C for aluminium.
The heat flowing through the positon head (H) may be deternined by the following expression, i.e.,
H = C × HCV × m × B.P. (in kW)
where
C = Constant representing that portion of the heat supplied to the engine
which is absorbed by the piston. Its value is usually taken
as 0.05.
HCV = Higher calorific value of the fuel in kJ/kg. It may be taken as
45 × 103 kJ/kg for diesel and 47 × 103 kJ/ kg for petrol,
m = Mass of the fuel used in kg per brake power per second, and
B.P. = Brake power of the engine per cylinder
Notes : 1. The thickness of the piston head (tH) is calculated by using equations (i) and (ii) and larger of the two
values obtained should be adopted.
2. When tH is 6 mm or less, then no ribs are required to strengthen the piston head against gas loads. But
when tH is greater then 6 mm, then a suitable number of ribs at the centre line of the boss extending around the
skirt should be provided to distribute the side thrust from the connecting rod and thus to prevent distortion of the
skirt. The thickness of the ribs may be takes as tH / 3 to tH / 2.
3. For engines having length of stroke to cylinder bore (L / D) ratio upto 1.5, a cup is provided in the top
of the piston head with a radius equal to 0.7 D. This is done to provide a space for combustion chamber.
32.9 Piston Rings
The piston rings are used to impart the necessary radial pressure to maintain the seal between
the piston and the cylinder bore. These are usually made of grey cast iron or alloy cast iron because of
their good wearing properties and also they retain spring characteristics even at high temperatures.
The piston rings are of the following two types :
1. Compression rings or pressure rings, and
2. Oil control rings or oil scraper.
The compression rings or pressure rings are inserted in the grooves at the top portion of the
piston and may be three to seven in number. These rings also transfer heat from the piston to the
cylinder liner and absorb some part of the piston fluctuation due to the side thrust.
The oil control rings or oil scrapers are provided below the compression rings. These rings
provide proper lubrication to the liner by allowing sufficient oil to move up during upward stroke and
at the same time scraps the lubricating oil from the surface of the liner in order to minimise the flow
of the oil to the combustion chamber.
The compression rings are usually made of rectangular cross-section and the diameter of the
ring is slightly larger than the cylinder bore. A part of the ring is cut- off in order to permit it to go into
the cylinder against the liner wall. The diagonal cut or step cut ends, as shown in Fig. 32.4 (a) and (b)
respectively, may be used. The gap between the ends should be sufficiently large when the ring is put
cold so that even at the highest temperature, the ends do not touch each other when the ring expands,
otherwise there might be buckling of the ring.

Fig. 32.4. Piston rings.
The radial thickness (t1) of the ring may be obtained by considering the radial pressure between
the cylinder wall and the ring. From bending stress consideration in the ring, the radial thickness is
given by
t1 =

p
D
σ
where
D = Cylinder bore in mm,
pw = Pressure of gas on the cylinder wall in N/mm2. Its value is limited
from 0.025 N/mm2 to 0.042 N/mm2, and
σt = Allowable bending (tensile) stress in MPa. Its value may be taken
from 85 MPa to 110 MPa for cast iron rings.
The axial thickness (t2 ) of the rings may be taken as 0.7 t1 to t1.
The minimum axial thickness (t2 ) may also be obtained from the following empirical relation:
t2 = 10
R
D
n
where
nR = Number of rings.
The width of the top land (i.e. the distance from the top of the piston to the first ring groove) is
made larger than other ring lands to protect the top ring from high temperature conditions existing at
the top of the piston,
∴Width of top land,
b1 = tH to 1.2 tH
The width of other ring lands (i.e. the distance between the ring grooves) in the piston may be
made equal to or slightly less than the axial thickness of the ring (t2).
∴ Width of other ring lands,
b2 = 0.75 t2  to  t2
The depth of the ring grooves should be more than the depth of the ring so that the ring does not
take any piston side thrust.
The gap between the free ends of the ring is given by 3.5 t1 to 4 t1. The gap, when the ring is in
the cylinder, should be 0.002 D to 0.004 D.
32.10 Piston Barrel
It is a cylindrical portion of the piston. The maximum thickness (t3) of the piston barrel may be
obtained from the following empirical relation :
t3 = 0.03 D + b + 4.5 mm
Contents
Top
Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1137
where
b = Radial depth of piston ring groove which is taken as 0.4 mm larger
than the radial thickness of the piston ring (t1)
= t1 + 0.4 mm
Thus, the above relation may be written as
t3 = 0.03 D + t1 + 4.9 mm
The piston wall thickness (t4) towards the open end is decreased and should be taken as 0.25 t3
to 0.35 t3.
32.11 Piston Skirt
The portion of the piston below the ring section is known as piston skirt. In acts as a bearing for
the side thrust of the connecting rod. The length of the piston skirt should be such that the bearing
pressure on the piston barrel due to the side thrust does not exceed 0.25 N/mm2 of the projected area
for low speed engines and 0.5 N/mm2 for high speed engines. It may be noted that the maximum
thrust will be during the expansion stroke. The side thrust (R) on the cylinder liner is usually taken as
1/10 of the maximum gas load on the piston.
We know that maximum gas load on the piston,

From equations (i) and (ii), the length of the piston skirt (l) is determined. In actual practice, the
length of the piston skirt is taken as 0.65 to 0.8 times the cylinder bore. Now the total length of the
piston (L) is given by
L = Length of skirt + Length of ring section + Top land
The length of the piston usually varies between D and 1.5 D. It may be noted that a longer piston
provides better bearing surface for quiet running of the engine, but it should not be made unnecessarily
long as it will increase its own mass and thus the inertia
forces.
32.12 Piston Pin
The piston pin (also called gudgeon pin or wrist pin)
is used to connect the piston and the connecting rod. It is
usually made hollow and tapered on the inside, the smallest
inside diameter being at the centre of the pin, as shown in Fig. 32.5. The piston pin passes through the
bosses provided on the inside of the piston skirt and the bush of the small end  of the connecting rod.
The centre of piston pin should be 0.02 D  to  0.04 D above the centre of the skirt, in order to off-set
the turning effect of the friction and to obtain uniform distribution of pressure between the piston and
the cylinder liner.
The material used for the piston pin is usually case hardened steel alloy containing nickel,
chromium, molybdenum or vanadium having tensile strength from 710 MPa to 910 MPa.
Fig. 32.6. Full floating type piston pin.
The connection between the piston pin and the small end of the connecting rod may be made
either full floating type or semi-floating type. In the full floating type, the piston pin is free to turn
both in the *piston bosses and the bush of the small end of the connecting rod. The end movements of
the piston pin should be secured by means of spring circlips, as shown in Fig. 32.6, in order to prevent
the pin from touching and scoring the cylinder liner.
In the semi-floating type, the piston pin is either free to turn in the piston bosses and rigidly
secured to the small end of the connecting rod, or it is free to turn in the bush of the small end of
the connecting rod and is rigidly secured in the piston bosses by means of a screw, as shown in
Fig. 32.7
The piston pin should be designed for the maximum gas load or the inertia force of the piston,
whichever is larger. The bearing area of the piston pin should be about equally divided between the
piston pin bosses and the connecting rod bushing. Thus, the length of the pin in the connecting rod
bushing will be about 0.45 of the cylinder bore or piston diameter (D), allowing for the end clearance
Fig.32.5. Piston pin.
*
The mean diameter of the piston bosses is made 1.4 d0 for cast iron pistons and 1.5 d0 for aluminium
pistons, where d0 is the outside diameter of the piston pin. The piston bosses are usually tapered, increasing
the diameter towards the piston wall.

of the pin etc. The outside diameter of the piston pin (d0 ) is determined by equating the load on the
piston due to gas pressure (p) and the load on the piston pin due to bearing pressure ( pb1 ) at the small
end of the connecting rod bushing.

pb1 = Bearing pressure at the small end of the connecting rod bushing in

The piston pin may be checked in bending by assuming the gas load to be uniformly distributed

Example 32.2. Design a cast iron piston for a single acting four stroke engine for the following
data:
Cylinder bore = 100 mm ; Stroke = 125 mm ; Maximum gas pressure = 5 N/mm2 ; Indicated
mean effective pressure = 0.75 N/mm2 ; Mechanical efficiency = 80% ; Fuel consumption = 0.15 kg
per brake power per hour ; Higher calorific value of fuel = 42 × 103 kJ/kg ; Speed = 2000 r.p.m.
Any other data required for the design may be assumed.
Solution. Given : D = 100 mm ; L = 125 mm = 0.125 m ; p = 5 N/mm2 ; pm = 0.75 N/mm2;
m
η  = 80% = 0.8 ; m = 0.15 kg / BP / h = 41.7 × 10–6 kg / BP / s; HCV = 42 × 103 kJ / kg ;
N = 2000 r.p.m.
The dimensions for various components of the piston are determined as follows :
1. Piston head or crown
The thickness of the piston head or crown is determined on the basis of strength as well as on the
basis of heat dissipation and the larger of the two values is adopted.

...(Q For cast iron , k = 46.6 W/m/°C, and TC – TE = 220°C)
Taking the larger of the two  values, we shall adopt
tH = 16 mm  Ans.
Since the ratio of L / D is 1.25, therefore a cup in the top of the piston head with a radius equal
to 0.7 D (i.e. 70 mm) is provided.
2. Radial ribs
The radial ribs may be four in number. The thickness of the ribs varies from tH / 3 to tH / 2.
    ∴ Thickness of the ribs,  tR = 16 / 3 to 16 / 2 = 5.33 to 8 mm
Let us adopt
tR = 7 mm Ans.
3. Piston rings
Let us assume that there are total four rings (i.e. nr = 4) out of which three are compression rings
and  one is an oil ring.
We know that the radial thickness of the piston rings,

and width of other ring lands,
b2 = 0.75 t2 to t2 = 0.75 × 3 to 3 mm = 2.25 to 3 mm
Let us adopt
b1 = 18 mm ; and b2 = 2.5 mm Ans.
We know that the gap between the free ends of the ring,
G1 = 3.5 t1 to 4 t1 = 3.5 × 3.4 to 4 × 3.4 mm = 11.9 to 13.6 mm
and the gap when the ring is in the cylinder,
G2 = 0.002 D to 0.004 D = 0.002 × 100 to 0.004 × 100 mm
                                    = 0.2 to 0.4 mm
Let us adopt                G1 = 12.8 mm ; and G2 = 0.3 mm Ans.
4. Piston barrel
Since the radial depth of the piston ring grooves (b) is about 0.4 mm more than the radial
thickness of the piston rings  (t1), therefore,
b = t1 + 0.4 = 3.4 + 0.4 = 3.8 mm
We know that the maximum thickness of barrel,
t3 = 0.03 D + b + 4.5 mm = 0.03 × 100 + 3.8 + 4.5 = 11.3 mm
and piston wall thickness towards the open end,
t4 = 0.25 t3 to 0.35 t3 = 0.25 × 11.3 to 0.35 × 11.3 = 2.8 to 3.9 mm
Let us adopt

...(Taking pb = 0.45 N/mm2)
From above, we find that
45 l = 3928 or  l = 3928 / 45 = 87.3 say 90 mm Ans.
∴

∴ Total length of the piston ,
L = Length of the skirt + Length of the ring section + Top land

We know that load on the pin due to bearing pressure

di = 0.6 × 35 = 21 mm Ans.

32.13 Connecting Rod
The connecting rod is the intermediate member between the piston and the crankshaft. Its primary
function is to transmit the push and pull from the piston pin to the crankpin and thus convert the
reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotary motion of the crank. The usual form of the connecting
rod in internal combustion engines is shown in Fig. 32.9. It consists of a long shank, a small end and a
big end. The cross-section of the shank may be rectangular, circular, tubular, I-section or H-section.
Generally circular section is used for low speed engines while I-section is preferred for high speed engines.
Fig. 32.9. Connecting rod.
The *length of the connecting rod ( l ) depends upon the ratio of l / r, where r is the radius of
crank. It may be noted that the smaller length will decrease the ratio l / r. This increases the angularity
of the connecting rod which increases the side thrust of the piston against the cylinder liner which in
turn increases the wear of the liner. The larger length of the connecting rod will increase the ratio
l / r. This decreases the angularity of the connecting rod and thus decreases the side thrust and the
resulting wear of the cylinder. But the larger length of the connecting rod increases the overall height
of the engine. Hence, a compromise is made and the ratio l / r is generally kept as 4 to 5.
The small end of the connecting rod is usually made in the form of an eye and is provided with
a bush of phosphor bronze. It is connected to the piston by means of a piston pin.
The big end of the connecting rod is usually made split (in two **halves) so that it can be
mounted easily on the crankpin bearing shells. The split cap is fastened to the big end with two cap
bolts. The bearing shells of the big end are made of steel, brass or bronze with a thin lining (about
0.75 mm) of white metal or babbit metal. The wear of the big end bearing is allowed for by inserting
thin metallic strips (known as shims) about 0.04 mm thick between the cap and the fixed half of the
connecting rod. As the wear takes place, one or more strips are removed and the bearing is trued up.
*
It is the distance between the centres of small end and big end of the connecting rod.
**
One half is fixed with the connecting rod and the other half (known as cap) is fastened with two cap bolts.

The connecting rods are usually manufactured by drop forging process and it should have adequate
strength, stiffness and minimum weight. The material mostly used for connecting rods varies from
mild carbon steels (having 0.35 to 0.45 percent carbon) to alloy steels (chrome-nickel or chrome-
molybdenum steels). The carbon steel having 0.35 percent carbon has an ultimate tensile strength of
about 650 MPa when properly heat treated and a carbon steel with 0.45 percent carbon has a ultimate
tensile strength of 750 MPa. These steels are used for connecting rods of industrial engines. The alloy
steels have an ultimate tensile strength of about 1050 MPa and are used for connecting rods of
aeroengines and automobile engines.
The bearings at the two ends of the connecting rod are either splash lubricated or pressure
lubricated. The big end bearing is usually splash lubricated while the small end bearing is pressure
lubricated. In the splash lubrication system, the cap at the big end is provided with a dipper or spout
and set at an angle in such a way that when the connecting rod moves downward, the spout will dip
into the lubricating oil contained in the sump. The oil is forced up the spout and then to the big end
bearing. Now when the connecting rod moves upward, a splash of oil is produced by the spout. This
splashed up lubricant find its way into the small end bearing through the widely chamfered holes
provided on the upper surface of the small end.
In the pressure lubricating system, the lubricating oil is fed under pressure to the big end bearing
through the holes drilled in crankshaft, crankwebs and crank pin. From the big end bearing, the oil is fed to
small end bearing through a fine hole drilled in the shank of the connecting rod. In some cases, the small
end bearing is lubricated by the oil scrapped from the walls of the cyinder liner by the oil scraper rings.
32.14 Forces Acting on the Connecting Rod
The various forces acting on the connecting rod are as follows :
1. Force on the piston due to gas pressure and inertia of the reciprocating parts,
2. Force due to inertia of the connecting rod or inertia bending forces,
3. Force due to friction of the piston rings and of the piston, and
4. Force due to friction of the piston pin bearing and the crankpin bearing.
We shall now derive the expressions for the forces acting on a vertical engine, as discussed below.
1. Force on the piston due to gas pressure and inertia of reciprocating parts
Consider a connecting rod PC as shown in Fig. 32.10.

It may be noted that the inertia force of reciprocating parts opposes the force on the piston when
it moves during its downward stroke (i. e. when the piston moves from the top dead centre to bottom
dead centre). On the other hand, the inertia force of the reciprocating parts helps the force on the
piston when it moves from the bottom dead centre to top dead centre.
∴ Net force acting on the piston or piston pin (or gudgeon pin or wrist pin),

The –ve sign is used when piston moves from TDC to BDC and +ve sign is used when piston

The force in the connecting rod will be maximum when the crank and the connecting rod are
perpendicular to each other (i.e. when θ = 90°). But at this position, the gas pressure would be de-
creased considerably. Thus, for all practical purposes, the force in the connecting rod (FC) is taken
equal to the maximum force on the piston due to pressure of gas (FL), neglecting piston inertia
effects.
2. Force due to inertia of the connecting rod or inertia bending forces
Consider a connecting rod PC and a crank OC rotating with uniform angular velocity ω rad / s.
In order to find the accleration of various points on the connecting rod, draw the Klien’s acceleration
diagram CQNO as shown in Fig. 32.11 (a). CO represents the acceleration of C towards O and NO
represents the accleration of P towards O. The acceleration of other points such as D, E, F and G etc.,
on the connecting rod PC may be found by drawing horizontal lines from these points to intresect CN
at d, e, f, and g respectively. Now dO, eO, fO and gO respresents the acceleration of D, E, F and G all
towards O. The inertia force acting on each point will be as follows:
      Inertia force at   C = m × ω2 × CO
Inertia force at D = m × ω2 × dO
Inertia force at E = m × ω2 × eO, and so on.
Fig. 32.11. Inertia bending forces.
The inertia forces will be opposite to the direction of acceleration or centrifugal forces. The
inertia forces can be resolved into two components, one parallel to the connecting rod and the other
perpendicular to rod. The parallel (or longitudinal) components adds up algebraically to the force

acting on the connecting rod (FC) and produces thrust on the pins. The perpendicular (or transverse)
components produces bending action (also called whipping action) and the stress induced in the
connecting rod is called whipping stress.
It may be noted that the perpendicular components will be maximum, when the crank and
connecting rod are at right angles to each other.
The variation of the inertia force on the connecting rod is linear and is like a simply supported
beam of variable loading as shown in Fig. 32.11 (b) and (c). Assuming that the connecting rod is of
uniform cross-section and has mass m1 kg per unit length, therefore,
Inertia force per unit length at the crankpin

and inertia force per unit length at the piston pin

where
Z = Section modulus.
From above we see that the maximum bending moment varies as the square of speed, therefore,
the bending stress due to high speed will be dangerous. It may be noted that the maximum axial force
and the maximum bending stress do not occur simultaneously. In an I.C. engine, the maximum gas
load occurs close to top dead centre whereas the maximum bending stress occurs when the crank
angle θ = 65° to 70° from top dead centre. The pressure of gas falls suddenly as the piston moves from
dead centre. Thus the general practice is to design a connecting rod by assuming the force in the
connecting rod (FC) equal to the maximum force due to pressure (FL), neglecting piston inertia
effects and then checked for bending stress due to inertia force (i.e. whipping stress).
3. Force due to friction of piston rings and of the piston
The frictional force ( F ) of the piston rings may be determined by using the following expression
:

nR = Number of rings,
pR = Pressure of rings (0.025 to 0.04 N/mm2), and
μ = Coefficient of friction (about 0.1).
Since the frictional force of the piston rings is usually very small, therefore, it may be
neglected.
The friction of the piston is produced by the normal component of the piston pressure which
varies from 3 to 10 percent of the piston pressure. If the coefficient of friction is about 0.05 to 0.06,
then the frictional force due to piston will be about 0.5 to 0.6 of the piston pressure, which is very low.
Thus, the frictional force due to piston is also neglected.
4. Force due to friction of the piston pin bearing and crankpin bearing
The force due to friction of the piston pin bearing and crankpin bearing, is to bend the connecting
rod and to increase the compressive stress on the connecting rod due to the direct load. Thus, the
maximum compressive stress in the connecting rod will be
σc (max) = Direct compressive stress + Maximum bending or whipping stress
due to inertia bending stress
32.15 Design of Connecting Rod
In designing a connecting rod, the following dimensions are required to be determined :
1. Dimensions of cross-section of the connecting rod,
2. Dimensions of the crankpin at the big end and the piston pin at the small end,
3. Size of bolts for securing the big end cap, and
4. Thickness of the big end cap.
The procedure adopted in determining the above mentioned dimensions is discussed as below :

1. Dimensions of cross-section of the connecting rod
A connecting rod is a machine member which is subjected to alternating direct compressive and
tensile forces. Since the compressive forces are much higher than the tensile forces, therefore, the
cross-section of the connecting rod is designed as a strut and the Rankine’s formula is used.
A connecting rod, as shown in Fig. 32.12, subjected to an axial load W may buckle with X-axis
as neutral axis (i.e. in the plane of motion of the connecting rod) or Y-axis as neutral axis (i.e. in the
plane perpendicular to the plane of motion). The connecting rod is considered like both ends hinged
for buckling about X-axis and both ends fixed for buckling about Y-axis.
A connecting rod should be equally strong in buckling about both the axes.
Let
A = Cross-sectional area of the connecting rod,
l = Length of the connecting rod,
σc = Compressive yield stress,
WB = Buckling load,
Ixx and Iyy = Moment of inertia of the section about X-axis and Y-axis
respectively, and
kxx and kyy = Radius of gyration of the section about X-axis and Y-axis
respectively.

This shows that the connecting rod is four times
strong in buckling about Y-axis than about X-axis. If
Ixx > 4 Iyy, then buckling will occur about Y- axis and
if Ixx < 4 Iyy, buckling will occur about X-axis. In
actual practice, Ixx is kept slightly less than  4 Iyy. It
is usually taken between 3 and 3.5 and the connecting
rod is designed for bucking about X-axis. The design
will always be satisfactory for buckling about Y-axis.
The most suitable section for the connecting
rod is I-section with the proportions as shown in
Fig. 32.13 (a).
Let thickness of the flange and web of the
section = t
Width of the section,     B = 4 t
and depth or height of the section,
                                H = 5t
From Fig. 32.13 (a), we find that area of the section,

After deciding the proportions for I-section of the connecting rod, its dimensions are determined
by considering the buckling of the rod about X-axis (assuming both ends hinged) and applying the
Rankine’s formula. We know that buckling load,

The buckling load (WB) may be calculated by using the following relation, i.e.

The factor of safety may be taken as 5 to 6.
Notes : (a) The I-section of the connecting rod is used due to its lightness and to keep the inertia forces as low
as possible specially in case of high speed engines. It can also withstand high gas pressure.
(b) Sometimes a connecting rod may have rectangular section. For slow speed engines, circular section
may be used.
(c) Since connecting rod is manufactured by forging, therefore the sharp corner of I-section are rounded
off as shown in Fig. 32.13 (b) for easy removal of the section from dies.

The dimensions B = 4 t and  H = 5 t, as obtained above by applying the Rankine’s formula,
are at the middle of the connecting rod. The width of the section (B) is kept constant throughout the
length of the connecting rod, but the depth or height varies. The depth near the small end (or piston
end) is taken as H1 = 0.75 H to 0.9H and the depth near the big end (or crank end) is taken
H2 = 1.1H to 1.25H.
2. Dimensions of the crankpin at the big end and the piston pin at the small end
Since the dimensions of the crankpin at the big end and the piston pin (also known as gudgeon
pin or wrist pin) at the small end are limited, therefore, fairly high bearing pressures have to be
allowed at the bearings of these two pins.
The crankpin at the big end
has removable precision bearing
shells of brass or bronze or steel
with a thin lining (1 mm or less)
of bearing metal (such as tin, lead,
babbit, copper, lead) on the inner
surface of the shell. The allowable
bearing pressure on the crankpin
depends upon many factors such
as material of the bearing,
viscosity of the lubricating oil,
method of lubrication and the
space limitations.The value of
bearing pressure may be taken
as 7 N/mm2 to 12.5 N/mm2
depending upon the material and
method of lubrication used.
The piston pin bearing is usually a phosphor bronze bush of about 3 mm thickness and the
allowable bearing pressure may be taken as 10.5 N/mm2 to 15 N/mm2.
Since the maximum load to be carried by the crankpin and piston pin bearings is the maximum
force in the connecting rod (FC), therefore the dimensions for these two pins are determined for the
maximum force in the connecting rod (FC) which is taken equal to the maximum force on the piston
due to gas pressure (FL) neglecting the inertia forces.
We know that maximum gas force,
FL =

D

π
×
...(i)
where
D = Cylinder bore or piston diameter in mm, and
p = Maximum gas pressure in N/mm2
Now the dimensions of the crankpin and piston pin are determined as discussed below :
Let
dc = Diameter of the crank pin in mm,
lc = Length of the crank pin in mm,
pbc = Allowable bearing pressure in N/mm2, and
dp, lp  and pbp = Corresponding values for the piston pin,
We know that load on the crank pin
= Projected area × Bearing pressure
= dc . lc . pbc
...(ii)
Similarly, load on the piston pin
=  dp . lp . pbp
...(iii)

1154    A Textbook of Machine Design
Equating equations (i) and (ii), we have
FL =  dc · lc · pbc
Taking lc = 1.25 dc to 1.5 dc, the value of dc and lc are determined from the above expression.
Again, equating equations (i) and (iii), we have
FL = dp · lp · pbp
Taking lp = 1.5 dp to 2 dp, the value of dp and lp are determined from the above expression.
3. Size of bolts for securing the big end cap
The bolts and the big end cap are subjected to tensile force which corresponds to the inertia
force of the reciprocating parts at the top dead centre on the exhaust stroke. We know that inertia

repeated stresses but not alternating stresses, therefore, a factor of safety may be taken as 6.

supported at the cap bolt centres and loaded by the inertia force at the top dead centre on the exhaust

the centrally concentrated load. Therefore, the maximum bending moment acting on the cap will be

Note: The design of connecting rod should be checked for whipping stress (i.e. bending stress due to inertia
force on the connecting rod).
Example 32.3. Design a connecting rod for an I.C. engine running at 1800 r.p.m. and developing
a maximum pressure of 3.15 N/mm2. The diameter of the piston is 100 mm ; mass of the reciprocating
parts per cylinder 2.25 kg; length of connecting rod 380 mm; stroke of piston 190 mm and compression
ratio 6 : 1. Take a factor of safety of 6 for the design. Take length to diameter ratio for big end
bearing as 1.3 and small end bearing as 2 and the corresponding bearing pressures as 10 N/mm2
and 15 N/mm2. The density of material of the rod may be taken as 8000 kg/m3 and the allowable
stress in the bolts as 60 N/mm2 and in cap as 80 N/mm2. The rod is to be of I-section for which you
can choose your own proportions.
Draw a neat dimensioned sketch showing provision for lubrication. Use Rankine formula for
which the numerator constant may be taken as 320 N/mm2 and the denominator constant 1 / 7500.

Solution. Given : N = 1800 r.p.m. ; p = 3.15 N/mm2 ; D = 100 mm ; mR = 2.25 kg ; l = 380 mm
= 0.38 m ; Stroke = 190 mm ; *Compression ratio = 6 : 1 ; F. S. = 6.
The connecting rod is designed as discussed
below :
1. Dimension of I- section of the connecting rod
Let us consider an I-section of the connecting
rod, as shown in Fig. 32.14 (a), with the following
proportions :
Flange and web thickness of the section = t
Width of the section,    B = 4t
and depth or height of the section,
H = 5t
First of all, let us find whether the section
chosen is satisfactory or not.
We have already discussed that the connecting rod is considered like both ends hinged for
buckling about X-axis and both ends fixed for buckling about Y-axis. The connecting rod should be
equally strong in buckling about both the axes. We know that in order to have a connecting rod
equally strong about both the axes,
Ixx = 4 Iyy
where
Ixx = Moment of inertia of the section about X-axis, and
Iyy = Moment of inertia of the section about Y-axis.
In actual practice, Ixx is kept slightly less than 4 Iyy. It is usually taken between 3 and 3.5 and the
connecting rod is designed for buckling about X-axis.
Now, for the section as shown in Fig. 32.14 (a), area of the section,
A = 2 (4 t × t ) + 3t × t = 11 t2
Ixx =

 therefore the section chosen in quite satisfactory.
Now let us find the dimensions of this I-section. Since the connecting rod is designed by taking

pressure,  therefore,

We know that the connecting rod is designed for buckling about X-axis (i.e. in the plane of
motion of the connecting rod) assuming both ends hinged. Since a factor of safety is given as 6,
therefore the buckling load,
WB = FC × F. S. = 24 740 × 6 = 148 440 N

These dimensions are at the middle of the connecting rod. The width (B) is kept constant through-
out the length of the rod, but the depth (H) varies. The depth near the big end or crank end is kept as 1.1H
to 1.25H and the depth near the small end or piston end is kept as 0.75H to 0.9H. Let us take
Depth near the big end,
H1 = 1.2H = 1.2 × 35 = 42 mm
and depth near the small end,
H2 = 0.85H = 0.85 × 35 = 29.75 say 30 mm
∴ Dimensions of the section near the big end
= 42 mm × 28 mm Ans.
and dimensions of the section near the small end
= 30 mm × 28 mm Ans.
Since the connecting rod is manufactured by forging, therefore the sharp corners of I-section
are rounded off, as shown in Fig. 32.14 (b), for easy removal of the section from the dies.
2. Dimensions of the crankpin or the big end bearing and piston pin or small end bearing
Let
dc = Diameter of the crankpin or big end bearing,
lc = length of the crankpin or big end bearing  = 1.3 dc
...(Given)
pbc = Bearing pressure = 10 N/mm2
...(Given)
We know that load on the crankpin or big end bearing
= Projected area × Bearing pressure
= dc .lc . pbc = dc × 1.3 dc × 10 = 13 (dc)2
Since the crankpin or the big end bearing is designed for the maximum gas force (FL), therefore,
equating the load on the crankpin or big end bearing to the maximum gas force, i.e.
13 (dc)2 = FL = 24 740 N
∴
(dc )2 = 24 740 / 13 = 1903   or   dc = 43.6 say 44 mm Ans.
and
lc = 1.3 dc = 1.3 × 44 = 57.2 say 58 mm Ans.
The big end has removable precision bearing shells of brass or bronze or steel with a thin lining
(1mm or less) of bearing metal such as babbit.
Again, let
dp = Diameter of the piston pin or small end bearing,
lp = Length of the piston pin or small end bearing  = 2dp
...(Given)
pbp = Bearing pressure = 15 N/mm2
..(Given)
We know that the load on the piston pin or small end bearing
= Project area × Bearing pressure
= dp . lp . pbp = dp × 2 dp × 15 = 30 (dp)2
Since the piston pin or the small end bearing is designed for the maximum gas force (FL),
therefore, equating the load on the piston pin or the small end bearing to the maximum gas force,
i.e.
30 (dp)2 = 24 740 N
∴
(dp)2 = 24 740 / 30 = 825   or   dp = 28.7 say 29 mm Ans.
and
lp = 2 dp = 2 × 29 = 58 mm Ans.
The small end bearing is usually a phosphor bronze bush of about 3 mm thickness.

We know that mass of the connecting rod per metre length,

32.16 Crankshaft
A crankshaft (i.e. a shaft with a crank) is used to convert reciprocating motion of the piston into
rotatory motion or vice versa. The crankshaft consists of the shaft parts which revolve in the main
bearings, the crankpins to which the big ends of the connecting rod are connected, the crank arms or
webs (also called cheeks) which connect the crankpins and the shaft parts. The crankshaft, depending
upon the position of crank, may be divided into the following two types :
1. Side crankshaft or overhung crankshaft, as shown in Fig. 32.15 (a), and
2. Centre crankshaft, as shown in Fig. 32. 15 (b).

The crankshaft, depending upon the number of cranks in the shaft, may also be classfied as
single throw or multi-throw crankshafts. A crankhaft with only one side crank or centre crank is
called a single throw crankshaft whereas the crankshaft with two side cranks, one on each end or
with two or more centre cranks is known as multi-throw crankshaft.
The side crankshafts are used for medium and large size horizontal engines.
32.17 Material and manufacture of Crankshafts
The crankshafts are subjected to shock and fatigue loads. Thus material of the crankshaft should
be tough and fatigue resistant. The crankshafts are generally made of carbon steel, special steel or
special cast iron.
In industrial engines, the crankshafts are commonly made from carbon steel such as 40 C 8,
55 C 8 and 60 C 4. In transport engines, manganese steel such as 20 Mn 2, 27 Mn 2 and 37 Mn 2 are
generally used for the making of crankshaft. In aero engines, nickel chromium steel such as
35 Ni 1 Cr 60 and 40 Ni 2 Cr 1 Mo 28 are extensively used for the crankshaft.
The crankshafts are made by drop forging or casting process but the former method is more
common. The surface of the crankpin is hardened by case carburizing, nitriding or induction
hardening.
32.18 Bearing Pressures and Stresses in Crankshaft
The bearing pressures are very important in the design of crankshafts. The *maximum
permissible bearing pressure depends upon the maximum gas pressure, journal velocity, amount and
method of lubrication and change of direction of bearing pressure.
The following two types of stresses are induced in the crankshaft.
1.  Bending stress ; and 2. Shear stress due to torsional moment on the shaft.
*
The values of maximum permissible bearing pressures for different types of engines are given in
Chapter 26, Table 26.3.

Most crankshaft failures are caused by a progressive fracture due to repeated bending or reversed
torsional stresses. Thus the crankshaft is under fatigue loading and, therefore, its design should be
based upon endurance limit. Since the failure of a crankshaft is likely to cause a serious engine
destruction and neither all the forces nor all the stresses acting on the crankshaft can be determined
accurately, therefore a high factor of safety from 3 to 4, based on the endurance limit, is used.
The following table shows the allowable bending and shear stresses for some commonly used
materials for crankshafts :

32.19 Design Procedure for Crankshaft
The following procedure may be adopted for designing a crankshaft.
1. First of all, find the magnitude of the various loads on the crankshaft.
2. Determine the distances between the supports and their position with respect to the loads.
3. For the sake of simplicity and also for safety, the shaft is considered to be supported at the
centres of the bearings and all the forces and reactions to be acting at these points. The distances
between the supports depend on the length of the bearings, which in turn depend on the diameter of
the shaft because of the  allowable bearing pressures.
4. The thickness of the cheeks or webs is assumed to be from 0.4 ds to 0.6 ds, where ds is the
diameter of the shaft. It may also be taken as 0.22D to 0.32 D, where D is the bore of cylinder in mm.
5. Now calculate the distances between the supports.
6. Assuming the allowable bending and shear stresses, determine the main dimensions of the
crankshaft.
Notes: 1. The crankshaft must be designed or checked for at least two crank positions. Firstly, when the crank-
shaft is subjected to maximum bending moment and secondly when the crankshaft is subjected to maximum
twisting moment or torque.
2. The additional moment due to weight of flywheel, belt tension and other forces must be considered.
3. It is assumed that the effect of bending moment does not exceed two bearings between which a force is
considered.
32.20 Design of Centre Crankshaft
We shall design the centre crankshaft by considering the two crank possitions, i.e. when the
crank is at dead centre (or when the crankshaft is subjected to maximum bending moment) and when
the crank is at angle at which the twisting moment is maximum. These two cases are discussed in
detail as below :
1. When the crank is at dead centre. At this position of the crank, the maximum gas pressure on
the piston will transmit maximum force on the crankpin in the plane of the crank causing only bending
of the shaft. The crankpin as well as ends of the crankshaft will be only subjected to bending moment.
Thus, when the crank is at the dead centre, the bending moment on the shaft is maximum and the
twisting moment is zero.

2. When the crank is at an angle of maximum twisting moment
The twisting moment on the crankshaft will be maximum when the tangential force on the crank
(FT) is maximum. The maximum value of tangential force lies when the crank is at angle of 25° to 30º
from the dead centre for a constant volume combustion  engines  (i.e., petrol engines) and 30º to 40º
for constant pressure combustion engines (i.e., diesel engines).
Consider a position of the crank at an angle of maximum twisting moment as shown in Fig.
32.17 (a). If p′ is the intensity of pressure on the piston at this instant, then the piston gas load at this
position of crank,
FP =

and thrust on the connecting rod,
FQ =
P
cos
F
φ
where
φ = Angle of inclination of the connecting rod with the line of stroke
PO.
The *thrust in the connecting rod (FQ) may be divided into two components, one perpendicular
to the crank and the other along the crank. The component of FQ perpendicular to the crank is the
tangential force (FT) and the component of FQ along the crank is the radial force (FR) which produces
thrust on the crankshaft bearings. From Fig. 32.17 (b), we find that
Fig. 32.17. (a) Crank at an angle of maximum twisting moment. (b) Forces acting on the crank.
FT = FQ sin ( θ + φ  )
and
FR = FQ cos ( θ + φ  )
It may be noted that the tangential force will cause twisting of the crankpin and shaft while the
radial force will cause bending of the shaft.

The side or overhung crankshafts are used for medium size and large horizontal engines. Its
main advantage is that it requires only two bearings in either the single or two crank construction. The
design procedure for the side or overhung crankshaft is same as that for centre crankshaft. Let us now
design the side crankshaft by considering the two crank positions, i.e. when the crank is at dead centre
(or when the crankshaft is subjected to maximum bending moment) and when the crank is at an angle
at which the twisting moment is maximum. These two cases are discussed in detail as below:
1. When the crank is at dead centre. Consider a side crankshaft at dead centre with its loads
and distances of their application, as shown in Fig. 32.18.

The various parts of the side crankshaft, when the crank is at dead centre, are now designed as
discussed below:
(a) Design of crankpin. The dimensions of the crankpin are obtained by considering the crank-
pin in bearing and then checked for bending stress.
Let
dc = Diameter of the crankpin in mm,
lc = Length of the crankpin in mm, and
pb = Safe bearing pressure on the pin in N/mm2. It may be between
9.8 to 12.6 N/mm2.
We know that
FP = dc . lc . pb
From this expression, the values of dc and lc
may be obtained. The length of crankpin is usually
from 0.6 to 1.5 times the diameter of pin.
The crankpin is now checked for bending
stress. If it is assumed that the crankpin acts as a
cantilever and the load on the crankpin is uniformly
distributed, then maximum bending moment will
be

(c) Design of crank web. When the crank is at dead centre, the crank web is subjected to a

Bore  = 400 mm ; Stroke = 600 mm ; Engine speed = 200 r.p.m. ; Mean effective pressure = 0.5
N/mm2; Maximum combustion pressure = 2.5 N/mm2; Weight of flywheel used as a pulley = 50 kN;
Total belt pull = 6.5 kN.
When the crank has turned through 35° from the top dead centre, the pressure on the piston is
1N/mm2 and the torque on the crank is maximum. The ratio of the connecting rod length to the crank
radius is 5. Assume any other data required for the design.
Solution. Given : D = 400 mm ; L = 600 mm or r = 300 mm ; pm = 0.5 N/mm2 ; p = 2.5 N/mm2 ;
W = 50 kN ; T1 + T2 = 6.5 kN ; θ = 35° ; p′ = 1N/mm2 ; l / r = 5
We shall design the crankshaft for the two positions of the crank, i.e. firstly when the crank is at
the dead centre ; and secondly when the crank is at an angle of maximum twisting moment.

Since this bearing pressure is less than the safe limit of 5 to 8 N/mm2, therefore, the design is safe.
Example 32.5. Design a side or overhung crankshaft for a 250 mm × 300 mm gas engine. The
weight of the flywheel is 30 kN and the explosion pressure is 2.1 N/mm2. The gas pressure at the
maximum torque is 0.9 N/mm2, when the crank angle is 35° from I. D. C. The connecting rod is 4.5
times the crank radius.
Solution. Given : D = 250 mm ; L = 300 mm or r = L / 2 = 300 / 2  = 150 mm ; W = 30 kN
= 30 × 103 N ; p = 2.1 N/mm2, p′ = 0.9 N/mm2 ; l = 4.5 r or l / r = 4.5
We shall design the crankshaft for the
two positions of the crank, i.e. firstly when
the crank is at the dead centre and secondly
when the crank is at an angle of maximum
twisting moment.

at the dead centre (See Fig. 32.18)

Now the various parts of the crankshaft
are designed as discussed below:
(a)  Design of crankpin
Let
dc = Diameter of the crankpin in mm, and
lc = Length of the crankpin = 0.8 dc
...(Assume)
Considering the crankpin in bearing, we have
FP = dc.lc.pb
103 × 103 = dc × 0.8 dc × 10 = 8 (dc)2
...(Taking pb = 10 N/mm2)
∴
(dc)2 = 103 × 103 / 8 = 12 875 or dc = 113.4 say 115 mm
and
lc = 0.8 dc = 0.8 × 115 = 92 mm
Let us now check the induced bending stress in the crankpin.
We know that bending moment at the crankpin,

Since the induced bending stress is within the permissible limits of 60 MPa, therefore, design of

(b)  Design of bearings
Let
d1 = Diameter of the bearing 1.
Let us take thickness of the crank web,
t = 0.6 dc= 0.6 × 115 = 69 or 70 mm
and length of the bearing,
l1 = 1.7 dc = 1.7 × 115 = 195.5 say 200 mm
We know that bending moment at the centre of the bearing 1,
M = FP (0.75lc + t + 0.5 l1)
= 103 × 103 (0.75 × 92 + 70 + 0.5 × 200) = 24.6 × 106 N-mm
We also know that bending moment (M),

We know that bending moment on the crank web,

32.22 Valve Gear Mechanism
The valve gear mechanism of an I.C. engine consists of those parts which actuate the inlet and
exhaust valves at the required time with respect to the position of piston and crankshaft.Fig .32.20 (a)
shows the valve gear arrangement for vertical engines. The main components of the mechanism are
valves, rocker arm, * valve springs, **push rod, ***cam and camshaft.
Fig. 32.20. Valve gear mechanism.
*
For the design of springs, refer Chapter 23.
**
For the design of push rod, refer Chapter 16 (Art. 16.14).
*** For the design of cams, refer to Authors’ popular book on ‘Theory of Machines’.

The fuel is admitted to the engine by the inlet valve and the burnt gases are escaped through the
exhaust valve. In vertical engines, the cam moving on the rotating camshaft pushes the cam follower
and push rod upwards, thereby transmitting the cam action to rocker arm. The camshaft is rotated by
the toothed belt from the crankshaft. The rocker arm is pivoted at its centre by a fulcrum pin. When
one end of the rocker arm is pushed up by the push rod, the other end moves downward. This pushes
down the valve stem causing the valve to move down, thereby opening the port. When the cam
follower moves over the circular portion of cam, the pushing action of the rocker arm on the valve is
released and the valve returns to its seat and closes it by the action of the valve spring.
In some of the modern engines, the camshaft is located at cylinder head level. In such cases, the
push rod is eliminated and the roller type cam follower is made part of the rocker arm. Such an
arrangement for the horizontal engines is shown in Fig. 32.20 (b).
32.23 Valves
The valves used in internal combustion engines are
of the following three types ;
1. Poppet or mushroom valve ; 2. Sleeve valve ;
3. Rotary valve.
Out of these three valves, poppet valve, as shown
in Fig. 32.21, is very frequently used. It consists of head,
face and stem. The head and face of the valve is sepa-
rated by a small margin, to aviod sharp edge of the valve
and also to provide provision for the regrinding of the
face. The face angle generally varies from 30° to 45°.
The lower part of the stem is provided with a groove in
which spring retainer lock is installed.
Since both the inlet and exhaust valves are subjected
to high temperatures of 1930°C to 2200°C during the
power stroke, therefore, it is necessary that the material
of the valves should withstand these temperatures. Thus
the material of the valves must have good heat conduction,
heat resistance, corrosion resistance, wear resistance and
shock resistance. It may be noted that the temperature at
the inlet valve is less as compared to exhaust valve. Thus,
the inlet valve is generally made of nickel chromium alloy
steel and the exhaust valve (which is subjected to very high
temperature of exhaust gases) is made from silchrome steel
which is a special alloy of silicon and chromium.
In designing a valve, it is required to determine the following dimensions:
(a)  Size of the valve port
Let
ap = Area of the port,
vp = Mean velocity of gas flowing through the port,
a = Area of the piston, and
v = Mean velocity of the piston.
We know that
ap.vp = a.v

Sometimes, inlet port is made 20 to 40 precent larger than exhaust port for better cylinder
charging.
(b)  Thickness of the valve disc

the following relation, i.e.
t = k.dp

p
σ
where
k = Constant = 0.42 for steel and 0.54 for cast iron,
dp = Diameter of the port in mm,
p = Maximum gas pressure in N/mm2, and
σb = Permissible bending stress in MPa or N/mm2
= 50 to 60 MPa for carbon steel and 100 to 120 MPa for alloy steel.
(c)  Maximum lift of the valve
h = Lift of the valve.
The lift of the valve may be obtained by equating the area across the valve seat to the area of the
port. For a conical valve, as shown in Fig. 32.22, we have
π dp· h cos  α =

The valve seats usually have the same angle as the
valve seating surface. But it is preferable to make the angle
of valve seat 1/2° to 1° larger than the valve angle as shown

valve is made of steel for which k = 0.42. The angle at which the valve disc seat is tapered is 30°.

32.24 Rocker Arm
The * rocker arm is used to actuate the
inlet and exhaust valves motion as directed
by the cam and follower. It may be made of
cast iron, cast steel, or malleable iron. In or-
der to reduce inertia of the rocker arm, an I-
section is used for the high speed engines
and it may be rectangular section for low
speed engines. In four stroke engines, the
rocker arms for the exhaust valve is the most
heavily loaded. Though the force required
to operate the inlet valve is relatively small,
yet it is usual practice to make the rocker
*
The rocker arm has also been discussed in Chapter 15 on Levers (Refer Art. 15.9).

arm for the inlet valve of the same dimensions as that for exhaust valve. A typical rocker arm for
operating the exhaust valve is shown in Fig. 32.24. The lever ratio a / b is generally decided by
considering the space available for rocker arm. For moderate and low speed engines, a / b is equal to
one. For high speed engines, the ratio a / b is taken as 1/ 1.3. The various forces acting on the rocker
arm of exhaust valve are the gas load, spring force and force due to valve acceleration.
Fig. 32.24. Rocker arm for exhaust valve.
Let
mv = Mass of the valve,
dv = Diameter of the valve head,
h = Lift of the valve,
a = Acceleration of the valve,
pc = Cylinder pressure or back pressure when the exhust valve opens, and
ps = Maximum suction pressure.

and force due to valve acceleration,

∴  Maximum load on the rocker arm for exhaust valve,
Fe = P + Fs + Fva
It may be noted that maximum load on the rocker arm for inlet valve is
Fi = Fs + Fva
Since the maximum load on the rocker arm for exhaust valve is more than that of inlet valve,
therefore, the rocker arm must be designed on the basis of maximum load on the rocker arm for
exhaust valve, as discussed below :
1. Design for fulcrum pin. The load acting on the fulcrum pin is the total reaction (RF) at the
fulcrum point.
Contents
Top
1194    A Textbook of Machine Design
Let
d1 = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l1 = Length of the fulcrum pin.
Considering the bearing of the fulcrum pin. We know that load on the fulcrum pin,
RF = d1 · l1 · pb
The ratio of l1 / d1 is taken as 1.25 and the bearing pressure ( pb ) for ordinary lubrication is taken
from 3.5 to 6 N / mm2 and it may go upto 10.5 N/mm2 for forced lubrication.
The pin should be checked for the induced shear stress.
The thickness of the phosphor bronze bush may be taken from 2 to 4 mm. The outside diameter
of the boss at the fulcrum is usually taken twice the diameter of the fulcrum pin.
2. Design for forked end. The forked end of the rocker arm carries a roller by means of a pin.
For uniform wear, the roller should revolve in the eyes. The load acting on the roller pin is Fc.
Let
d2 = Diameter of the roller pin, and
l2 = Length of the roller pin.
Consiering the bearing of the roller pin. We know that load on the roller pin,
Fc = d2 · l2 · pb
The ratio of l2 / d2 may be taken as 1.25. The roller pin should be checked for induced shear
stesss.
The roller pin is fixed in eye and the thickness of each eye is taken as half the length of the
roller pin.
∴ Thickness of each eye = l2 / 2
The radial  thickness of eye (t3) is taken as d1 / 2 . Therefore overall diameter of the eye,
D1 = 2 d1
The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (atleast 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye.
A clearance of 1.5 mm between the roller and the fork on either side of the roller is provided.
3. Design for rocker arm cross-section. The rocker arm may be treated as a simply supported
beam and loaded at the fulcrum point. We have already discussed that the rocker arm is generally of
I-section but for low speed engines, it can be of rectangular section. Due to the load on the  valve, the
rocker arm is subjected to bending moment.
Let
l = Effective length of each rocker arm, and
σb = Permissible bending stress.
We know that bending moment on the rocker arm,
M = Fe × l
...(i)
We also know that bending moment,
M = σb × Z
...(ii)
where
Z = Section modulus.
From equations (i) and (ii), the value of Z is obtained and thus the dimensions of the section are
determined.
4. Design for tappet. The tappet end of the rocker arm is made circular to receive the tappet
which is a stud with a lock nut. The compressive load acting on the tappet is the maximum load on the
rocker arm for the exhaust valve (Fe).
Let
dc = Core diameter of the tappet, and
σc = Permissible compressive stress for the material of the tappet which
is made of mild steel. It may be taken as 50 MPa.
We know that load on the tappet,
Fe =

From this expression, the core diameter of the tappet is determined. The outer or nominal diameter
of the tappet (dn) is given as
Contents
Top
Internal Combustion Engine Parts     1195
dn = dc / 0.84
The diameter of the circular end of the rocker arm (D3) and its depth (t4) is taken as twice the
nominal diameter of the tappet (dn), i.e.
D3 = 2 dn ;  and  t4 = 2 dn
5. Design for valve spring.The valve spring is used to provide sufficient force during the valve
lifting process in order to overcome the inertia of valve gear and to keep it with the cam without
bouncing. The spring is generally made from plain carbon spring steel. The total load for which the
spring is designed is equal to the sum of initial load and load at full lift.
Let
W1 = Initial load on the spring
= Force on the valve tending to draw it into the cylinder on suction
stroke,
W2 = Load at full lift
= Full lift × Stiffness of spring
∴ Total load on the spring,
W = W1 + W2
Note : Here we are only interested in calculating the total load on the spring. The design of the valve spring is
done in the similar ways as discussed for compression springs in Chapter 23 on Springs.
Example 32.7. Design a rocker arm, and its bearings, tappet, roller and valve spring for the
exhaust valve of a four stroke I.C. engine from the following data:
Diameter of the valve head = 80 mm; Lift of the valve = 25 mm; Mass of associated parts with
the valve = 0.4 kg ; Angle of action of camshaft = 110° ; R. P. M. of the crankshaft = 1500.
From the probable indicator diagram, it has been observed that the greatest back pressure
when the exhaust valve opens is 0.4 N/mm2 and the greatest suction pressure is 0.02 N/mm2 below
atmosphere.
The rocker arm is to be of I-section and the effective length of each arm may be taken as
180 mm ; the angle between the two arms being 135°.
The motion of the valve may be assumed S.H.M., without dwell in fully open position.
Choose your own materials and suitable values for the stresses.
Draw fully dimensioned sketches of the valve gear.
Solution. Given : dv = 80 mm ; h = 25 mm ; or r = 25 / 2 = 12.5 mm = 0.0125 m ; m = 0.4 kg ;
α = 110° ; N = 1500 r.p.m. ; pc = 0.4 N/mm2 ; ps = 0.02 N/mm2 ; l = 180 mm ; θ = 135°
A rocker arm for operating the exhaust valve is shown in Fig. 32.25.
First of all, let us find the various forces acting on the rocker arm of the exhaust valve.

Fe = P + Fs + Fa = 2014.92 + 96.6 + 346.72 = 2458.24 say 2460 N
Since the length of the two arms of the rocker are equal, therefore, the load at the two ends of the
arm are equal, i.e. Fe = Fc = 2460 N.

Let us now design the various parts of the rocker arm.
1. Design of fulcrum pin
Let
d1 = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l1 = Length of the fulcrum pin = 1.25 d1
...(Assume)
Considering the bearing of the fulcrum pin. We know that load on the fulcrum pin (RF),
4545 = d1 × l1 × pb = d1 × 1.25 d1 × 5 = 6.25 (d1)2
...(For ordinary lubrication,  pb is taken as 5 N/mm2)
∴
(d1)2 = 4545 / 6.25 = 727 or d1 = 26.97 say 30 mm Ans.
and
l1 = 1.25 d1 = 1.25 × 30 = 37.5 mm Ans.
Now let us check the average shear stress induced in the pin. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore, load on the fulcrum pin (RF),

Assuming a phosphor bronze bush of 3 mm thick, the internal diameter of the hole in the lever,
dh = d1 + 2 × 3 = 30 + 6 = 36 mm
Let us now check the induced bending stress for the section of the boss at the fulcrum
which is shown in Fig. 32.26.

2. Design for forked end
Let
d2 = Diameter of the roller pin,
and
l2 = Length of the roller pin
 = 1.25 d1 ...(Assume)
Considering bearing of the roller pin. We know that load on the roller pin (Fc),
2460 = d2 × l2 × pb = d2 × 1.25 d2 × 7 = 8.75 (d2)2
... (Taking pb = 7 N / mm2)
∴
(d2)2
= 2460 / 8.75 = 281 or d2 = 16.76 say 18 mm Ans.
and
l2 = 1.25 d2 = 1.25 × 18 = 22.5 say 24 mm Ans.
Let us now check the roller pin for induced shearing stress. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore, load on the roller pin (Fc),

The maximum bending moment will occur at Y–Y.

This bending stress induced in the pin is within permissible limits.
Since the radial thickness of eye (t3) is taken as d2 / 2, therefore, overall diameter of the eye,
D2 = 2 d2 = 2 × 18 = 36 mm
The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (atleast 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye.
In the present case, 42 mm outer diameter of the roller will be
sufficient.

Normally thickness of the flange and web is constant throughout, whereas the width and depth

First of all, let us find the total load on the valve spring.
We know that initial load on the spring,

and load at full lift,
W2 = Full valve lift × Stiffiness of spring (s)
= 25 × 10 = 250 N

∴ Total load on the spring,
W = W1 + W2 = 96.6 + 250 = 346.6 N
Now let us find the various dimensions for the valve spring, as discussed below:

The standard size of the wire is SWG 7 having diameter ( d ) = 4.47 mm. Ans. (See Table 22.2).
∴ Mean diameter of the spring coil,
D = C · d = 8 × 4.47 = 35.76 mm Ans.
and outer diameter of the spring coil,
Do = D + d = 35.76 + 4.47 = 40.23 mm Ans.

(c)  Free length of the spring
Since the compression produced under W2 = 250 N is 25 mm (i.e. equal to full valve lift),

The valve opens 33º before outer dead cerntre and closes 1º after inner dead centre. It opens
and closes with constant acceleration and decleration for each half of the lift. The length of the
rocker arm on either side of the fulcrum is 150 mm and the included angle is 160º. The weight of the
valve is 3 N.
Solution. Given : D = 140 mm = 0.14 m ; L = 270 mm = 0.27 m ; Power = 8.25 kW = 8250 W ;
N = 475 r.p.m ; p = 3.5 N/mm2 ; l = 150 mm = 0.15 m ; θ = 160° ; w = 3 N

Valve head diameter
The projected width of the valve seat, for a seat angle of 45º, may be empirically taken as
0.05 dp to 0.07 dp. Let us take width of the valve seat as 0.06 dp i.e. 0.06 × 45 = 2.7 mm.
∴ Valve head diameter, dv =  dp + 2 × 2.7 = 45 + 5.4 = 50.4 say 51 mm Ans.
Now let us calculate the various forces acting on the rocker arm of exhaust valve.

The force due to acceleration (Fa) may be obtained as discussed below :
We know that total angle of crank for which the valve remains open
= 33 + 180 + 1 = 214º
Since the engine is a four stroke engine, therefore the camshaft angle for which the valve
remains open
= 214 / 2 = 107º
Now, when the camshaft turns through 107 / 2 = 53.5°, the valve lifts by a distance of 16 mm. It
may be noted that the half of this period is occupied by constant acceleration and half by constant
decleration. The same process occurs when the valve closes. Therefore, the period for constant
acceleration is equal to camshaft rotation of 53.5 / 2 = 26.75 º and during this time, the valve lifts
through a distance of 8 mm.
We know that speed of camshaft

∴ Angle turned by the camshaft per second

Fa = m · a + w =

9.81  × 45.274 + 3 = 16.84 N

We know that the maximum load on the rocker arm for exhaust valve,
Fe = P + Fs + Fa = 820 + 48 + 16.84 = 884.84 say 885 N
Since the length of the two arms of the rocker are equal, therefore, load at the two ends of the
arm are equal, i.e. Fe = Fc = 885 N.

The rocker arm is shown in Fig. 32.29. We shall now design the various parts of rocker arm as
discussed below:
Fig. 32.29
1. Design of fulcrum pin
Let
d1 = Diameter of the fulcrum pin, and
l1 = Length of the fulcrum pin = 1.25 d1
... (Assume)
Considering the bearing of the fulcrum pin. We know that load on the fulcrum pin (RF),
1743 = d1 × l1 × pb = d1 × 1.25 d1 × 5 = 6.25 (d1)2
... (For ordinary lubrication, pb is taken as 5 N/mm2)
∴
(d1)2 = 1743 / 6.25 = 279 or d1 = 16.7 say 17 mm
and
 l1 = 1.25 d1 = 1.25 × 17 = 21.25 say 22 mm
Now let us check the average shear stress induced in the pin. Since the pin is in double shear,
therefore, load on the fulcrum pin (RF),

Now, let us check the induced bending stress for the
section of the boss at the fulcrum which is shown in Fig.
32.30.
Bending moment at this section,
            M = Fe × l = 885 × 150 N-mm

2. Design for forked end
Let           d2 = Diameter of the roller pin, and
            l2 = Length of the roller pin = 1.25 d2
...(Assume)
Considering bearing of the roller pin. We know that load on the roller pin (Fc),
         885 = d2 × l2 × pb = d2 × 1.25 d2 × 7 = 8.75 (d2)2
...(Taking pb = 7 N/mm2)
∴       (d2)2 = 885 / 8.75 = 101.14   or   d2 = 10.06 say 11 mm Ans.
and
     l2 = 1.25 d2 = 1.25 × 11 = 13.75 say 14 mm Ans.

Let us now check the induced bending stress in the roller
pin. The pin is neither simply supported in fork nor rigidly fixed

distribution as shown in Fig. 32.31.
The maximum bending moment will occur at Y– Y.

Since the radial thickness of eye (t3) is taken as d2 / 2, therefore, overall diameter of the eye,
D2= 2 d2 = 2 × 11 = 22 mm
The outer diameter of the roller is taken slightly larger (at least 3 mm more) than the outer
diameter of the eye. In the present case, 28 mm outer diameter of the roller will be sufficient.
Providing a clearance of 1.5 mm between the roller and the fork on either side of the roller, we have
l3 = l2 + 2 × 2

t  + 2 × 1.5 = 14 + 2  × 7
2  + 3 = 24 mm
3. Design for rocker arm cross-section
Since the engine is a slow  speed engine, therefore, a rectangular section may be selected for the
rocker arm. The cross-section of the rocker arm is obtained by considering the bending of the sections
just near the boss of fulcrum on both sides, such as section A–A and B– B.

Let

B = Width or depth of the rocker arm which varies from boss diameter
of fulcrum to outside diameter of the eye (for the forked end side)
and from boss diameter of fulcrum to thickness t3 (for the tappet or
stud end side).

The adjustable tappet screw carries a compressive load of Fe = 885 N. Assuming the screw to
be made of mild steel for which the compressive stress (σc) may be taken as 50 MPa.
Let
dc = Core diameter of the tappet screw.

∴
D3 = 2 × 6.5 = 13 mm  Ans.
and
t4 = 2 × 6.5 = 13 mm Ans.
5. Design for valve spring
First of all, let us find the total load on the valve spring.
We know that intial load on the spring,
W1 = Initial spring force (Fs) = 48 N
...(Already calculated)
and load at full lift,
W2 = Full valve lift × Stiffness of spring (s)
= 16 × 8 = 128 N
...(Taking s = 8 N/mm)
∴ Total load on the spring,
W = W1 + W2  = 48 + 128 = 176 N
Now let us find the various dimensions for the valve spring as discussed below:
(a)  Mean diameter of the spring coil
Let
D = Mean diameter of the spring coil, and
d = Diameter of the spring wire.

(see Table 22.2)
∴ Mean diameter of spring coil,
D = C · d = 6 × 2.946 = 17.676 mm  Ans.
and outer diameter of the spring coil,
Do = D + d = 17.676 + 2.946 = 20.622 mm Ans.

Design of cam
The cam is forged as one piece with the camshaft. It is designed as discussed below :
The diameter of camshaft (D′) is taken empirically as
D′ = 0.16 × Cylinder bore + 12.7 mm
= 0.16 × 140 + 12.7 = 35.1 say 36 mm
The base circle diameter is about 3 mm greater than the camshaft diameter.
∴Base circle diameter
= 36 + 3 = 39 say 40 mm
The width of cam is taken equal to the width of roller, i.e. 14 mm.
The width of cam (w′) is also taken empirically as
w ′ = 0.09 × Cylinder bore + 6 mm = 0.09 × 140 +6 = 18.6 mm
Let us take the width of cam as 18 mm.
Now the *cam is drawn according to the procedure given below :
First of all, the displacement diagram, as shown in Fig. 32.32, is drawn as discussed in the
following steps :
1. Draw a horizontal line ANM such that AN represents the angular displacement when valve
opens (i.e. 53.5º) to some suitable scale. The line NM represents the angular displacement
of the cam when valve closes (i.e. 53.5º).
2. Divide AN and NM into any number of equal even parts (say six).
3. Draw vertical lines through points 0, 1, 2, 3 etc. equal to the lift of valve i.e. 16 mm.
4. Divide the vertical lines 3 – f and 3′ – f ′ into six equal parts as shown by points a, b, c ... and
a′, b′, c′ .... in Fig. 32.32.
5. Since the valve moves with equal uniform acceleration and decleration for each half of the
lift, therefore, valve displacement diagram for opening and closing of valve consists of
double parabola.
