Abstract 
 
 
In Automobile manufacturing plant, it was noticed that 7 out of 1000 crankshafts are prone to failure. This work is concentrated to 
identify the cause of failure in the crankshaft and to improve the fatigue life of the crankshaft by performing parametric study. In 
parametric study, the crankshaft is designed and analyzed in ANSYS WORKBENCH by varying the fillet radius of journal bearing. 
The maximum equivalent alternating stress and cycles to failure were predicted in numerical analysis. The cycles to failure are 
increased by varying the parameter and hence the fatigue life of crankshaft is improved.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Crankshaft is a large component with a complex geometry in the engine, which converts the reciprocating displacement of the 
piston into a rotary motion. This study was conducted on a four cylinder petrol engine. It must be strong enough to take the 
downward force during power stroke without excessive bending. [3] Due to the repeated bending and twisting load the crankshaft 
fails as cracks form in fillet area and prediction of fatigue life is important to ensure safety of components. [5] The journal pin fillet 
area is identified as the critical location. The stress concentration and cycles to failure is improved using ANSYS WORKBENCH

III. DETERMINATION OF FORCES 
A. Determination of Gaseous Forces 
The gas forces acting on the crankshaft are determined using Get Data software. It converts the graphical data into digital format. 
Hence, it is possible to obtain the values at any point on the curve. Minimum and maximum values of the volume of engine are 
obtained using the P-V diagram shown in figure 3.

Table 3: Maximum and minimum volume of engine during combustion 
 
Fig. 3: P-V diagram of Hyundai petrol engine 
Table 3 shows the values of Vmin and Vmax and the formulas used to obtain the swept volume of the engine is shown below. 
Vswept = Vmax - Vmin 
Swept volume can be written as 
Vswept = π R2S 
Where, 
R is radius of piston and 
S is stroke length of the engine. 
Therefore the volume of the engine is changing with respect to Ө. From the P-V diagram shown in fig 4 values of pressure 
at volumes are obtained. Using these relations values of pressures are obtained for different crank angles. (Crank angles in Ө)

B. Determination of Inertial Forces 
The parametric representation of the crankshaft, connecting rod and piston assembly is represented in figure 5. 
 
Fig. 5: Parametric representation of the crankshaft, connecting rod, and piston assembly 
 
The linear velocity and acceleration of piston are given by: 
vp = ω r (sinθ + (sin2θ/n)) 
ap = ω2 r (cosθ + (cos2θ/n)) 
Where 
ω is the angular velocity of crank shaft (rad/s) 
r is the radius of crank angle (m) 
θ is the crank angle with the horizontal 
n = l/r 
l is the length of the connecting rod (m) 
 
Forces acting on the crankshaft in X and Y direction considering effect of inertia force due to piston: 
(Fcx) p = -mp ap 
(Fcy)p = mp ap tanβ 
Where  
mp  is the mass of the piston (10 Kg) 
β is the angle connecting rod makes with the horizontal 
 
Forces acting on the crankshaft in X and Y direction considering effect of inertia force due to lumped mass of connecting rod 
at wrist pin C: 
(Fcx) c = - mw ap

Where - ms is the lumped mass of the connecting rod at crank pin B (0.19Kg) 
mr is the mass of the connecting rod ( 300g) 
The total bearing load is 
Fcx = -mp ap– mw ap – ms r ω2 cosθ - P 
Fcy = mp ap tanβ + ms ap tanβ + ms r ω2 sinθ +P tanβ 
Fcx and Fcy are expressed in the global coordinate system, which is not rotating with the crankshaft. Forces expressed in a 
coordinate system attached to the crankshaft are given by: 
FX = Fcx cosθ + Fcy sinθ 
FY = Fcy cosθ – Fcx sinθ 
IV. PARAMETRIC TECHNIQUES 
The fatigue life of the crankshaft for the existing crankshaft is 22014 number of cycles to failure at 4500 rpm. The critical region 
for the fatigue crack initiation is identified at the groove region on the main journal bearing of the crankshaft [10]. So in order to 
reduce the number of cycles to failure the fillet radius has to be modified. The journal groove near the fillet region of main bearing

is prone to fatigue failure because most of the degrees of freedom are constrained there [7]. To reduce the number of cycle to 
failure the profile of the existing fillet in the journal bearing of the crankshaft is to be changed with semi elliptical groove as shown 
in figure 6.

A. Dynamic Analysis 
The crankshaft is subjected to two different load sources  
 
Inertia of rotating components (e.g. Connecting rod) applies forces to the crankshaft and this force increases with the increase 
of engine speed.  
 
The second load source is the force applied to the crankshaft due to gas combustion in the cylinder. The slider-crank 
mechanism transports the pressure applied to the upper part of the slider to the joint between crankshaft and connecting rod 
[2].

B. Bending Test Analysis 
The maximum bending load acting on the crankpin bearing is at 355 degrees. The critical loads due to the slider crank mechanism 
induces bending and shear forces on the crankshaft.[5] The bending moment acting on the centre of the crankshaft is calculated 
based on the following equation           
M / I = σb / y 
Where  
M is the maximum bending moment acting on crankpin (N.m) 
I is the area moment of inertia = (π x dp)/64 (m4) 
Y is the distance of C.G from neutral fibre = dp/2 (m) 
σb is the maximum allowable bending stress for nodular cast   iron (210 MPa) 
dp  is the diameter of the crankpin (0.0384m) 
M = 1166.78 N.m

Figure 13 shows the reduction in equivalent alternating stress to 328.23 MPa and figure 14 shows the increase in cycles to failure 
to 2.657x105  at 4500 rpm after conducting bending test analysis. 
C. Torsional Test Analysis 
The twisting load on the crankshaft is a negligible force when compared with the bending load acting on the crankpin.The 
maximum twistinng moment on the crankshaft occurs at an crank angle of 25 to 35 degrees. The torque or twisting moment on the 
crankshaft is calculated as follows [4] 
Piston effort (Fp) =  (Net force acting on piston at 35 deg) - m ω2 r ( cos θ + (cos 2θ/n) ) + mg 
= 1410 – 3989 + 9.81 
= -2569.19 N 
T = FT  r = Fp  r  ( sin θ + (sin 2θ / 2 ( n2 – sin2 θ)1/2 ) ) 
= - 36.4 N.m 
where  
m is the mass of the reciprocating parts = 1 kg 
ω is the angular velocity of crankshaft = 471 rad/s 
r is the crank radius = 0.0192 m 
θ is the crankangle = 35 deg 
Fp is the piston effort, N 
FT is the tangential force acting on the crankshaft, N

Figure 15 shows the reduction in equivalent alternating   stress to 108 MPa   and table 5 shows the tabulated values of 
equivalent alternating stress and cycles to failure is increased to 106 cycles. 
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Dynamic Analysis 
 
The critical failure speed for crankshaft is maximum speed of 4500 rpm as the von misses stress at 3600 rpm is well under the 
yield stress and fatigue strength of the material. 
 
The maximum von misses stress for the crankshaft after parametric study was reduced from 453 MPa to 332 MPa which is a 
19 % reduction in the maximum von misses stress under dynamic condition at a maximum operating speed of 4500 rpm. 
 
The fatigue life of the crankshaft after design optimization was improved from 22104 to 7.895x105 number of cycles to failure 
under dynamic condition at a maximum speed of 4500 rpm.  
 
The stress concentration near the journal groove at the fillet region was reduced by changing the profile of existing groove of 
radius 1.1 mm to semi elliptical shape of radius 1.46 mm as shown in figure 6 so the stress gets equally distributed at the 
groove region. 
 
The notch sensitivity was reduced by increasing the r/d ratio to unity so that plasticity of the fillet surface is controlled. 
B. Bending Test Analysis 
 
The maximum von misses stress for the crankshaft after parametric study was reduced from 359 MPa to 328 MPa- a 8.6 % 
reduction in the stress level. 
 
The fatigue life of the crankshaft under bending condition after design optimization was improved from 8. 347x104 to 2.657 
x 105 number of cycles to failure which is due to minimization of stress near the groove region of the crankshaft.

C. Torsion Test Analysis 
 
In torsion test analysis the maximum von misses stress for the crankshaft was reduced from 114 to 108 MPa - a 5 % reduction 
in the stress level, by modifying the fillet radius in the journal bearing as fillet radius is inversely proportional to the stress 
concentration. 
VII. 
CONCLUSION

In dynamic analysis there was a 19% reduction in the maximum von misses stress and also the cycles to failure was increased 
to 34% 
 
The maximum von misses stress for the crankshaft after design optimization was reduced from 359 to 328 Mpa which is a 8.6 
% reduction in the stress level. 
 
The cycles to failure of the crankshaft under bending condition was increased by 21%. 
 
In torsion test analysis there was a 5% reduction in the maximum von misses stress. 
 
The fatigue life of the crankshaft in terms of cycles to failure has improved by modifying the existing crankshaft design.
