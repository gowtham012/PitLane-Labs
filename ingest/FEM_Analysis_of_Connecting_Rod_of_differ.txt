I. INTRODUCTION 
Connecting Rods are used practically generally 
used in all varieties of automobile engines. Acting 
as an intermediate link between the piston and the 
crankshaft of an engine of an automobile. It is 
responsible for transmission the up and down 
motion of the piston to the crankshaft of the engine, 
by converting the reciprocating motion of the piston 
to the rotary motion of crankshaft. While the one 
end, small end the connecting rod is connecting to 
the piston of the engine by the means of piston pin, 
the other end, the bigger end being connected to the 
crankshaft with lower end big end bearing by 
generally two bolts. 
 
Generally connecting rods are being made 
up of stainless steel and aluminium alloy through 
the forging process, as this method provides high 
productivity and that too with a lower production 
cost. Forces generated on the connected rod are 
generally by weight and combustion of fuel inside 
cylinder acts upon piston and then on the  
 
 
 
connecting rod, which results in both the bending 
and axial stresses. 
 
Therefore it order to study the strain 
intensity, stress concentration and deformation in 
the crank end of the connection rod, firstly based on 
the working parameter and the vehicle chosen the 
design parameter or dimensions of the connecting 
rod is calculated, then the model of the connecting 
rod parts is prepared and finally it is analysed using

Abstract: 
 
Connecting Rods are practically generally used in all varieties of automobile engines. Acting as an 
intermediate link between the piston and the crankshaft of an engine. It is responsible for transmission of the up 
and down motion of the piston to the crankshaft of the engine, by converting the reciprocating motion of the 
piston to the rotary motion of crankshaft. Thus, this study aims to carry out for the load, strain and stress analysis 
of the crank end of the connecting rod of different materials. Based on which the High Strength Carbon Fiber 
connecting rod will be compared with connecting rod made up of Stainless Steel and Aluminum Alloy. The 
results can be used for optimization for weight reduction and for design modification of the connecting rod. Pro-E 
software is used for modeling and analyses are carried out in ANSYS software. The results archived can also help 
us identify the spot or section where chances of failure are high due to stress induced. Also the results obtained 
can be used to modify the existing designs so that better performance and longer life cycle can be archived.

has many capabilities, ranging from simple static 
analysis to complex non-linear, dynamic analysis, 
thermal analysis, transient state analysis, etc. By 
solid modeling software, the geometric shape for 
the model is described, and then the ANSYS 
program is used for meshing the geometry for 
nodes and elements. In order to obtain the desirable 
results at each and every point of the model, the 
fine meshing is done which also results in accurate 
results output. In this study the elements formed 
after meshing are tetrahedral in shape. Loads and 
boundary constrains in the ANSYS can be applied 
on the surfaces and volume as required. Finally the 
results calculation is done by the ANSYS software 
and the desired output results can achieved. 
 
II. FINITE ELEMENT METHOD 
The finite element method (FEM) is a 
numerical technique for solving problems to find 
out approximate solution of a problem which are 
described by the partial differential equations or can 
also be formulated as functional minimization. A 
principle of interest is torepresented as an assembly 
of finite elements. Approximating functions in the 
finite elements are determined in the terms of the 
nodal values of a physical field which is sought. 
FEM subdivides a whole problem or entity into 
numbers of smaller simpler parts, called finite 
elements, and solve these parts for the problems. 
The main advantage of FEM is that it can handle 
complicated boundary and geometries with very 
ease. 
 
Steps for the Finite Element Method are:- 
‚Ä¢ Modelling the Model 
‚Ä¢ Import the model 
‚Ä¢ Defining element type 
‚Ä¢ Defining material properties 
‚Ä¢ Meshing of model 
‚Ä¢ Applying boundary constrains 
‚Ä¢ Applying load 
‚Ä¢ Results and Analysing it.

MODELING OF THE CONNECTING ROD 
USING PRO-E 
 
Pro-Eis used to create a complete 3D digital 
model of manufactured goods. The models consist 
of 2D and 3D solid model data which can also be 
used downstream in finite element analysis, rapid 
prototyping, 
tooling 
design, 
and 
CNC 
manufacturing. 
Connecting rod of a Light Vehicle Engine 
easily available in the market is selected and its 
dimensions are calculated based on the design and 
working parameters. According the dimensions 
obtained the model of the connecting rod is 
developed in the Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 4.0. 
Model of the connecting rod and its Big end 
Bearing Lower half the separately developed of this 
study as shown in figures below,

VIII. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS USING ANSYS 
The analysis of connecting rod models are carried 
out using ANSYS software using Finite Element 
Method. Firstly the model files prepared in the Pro-
E, then are exported to ANSYS software as an 
IGES files as shown in figure 5 & 6 below;

Figure 6: Imported model of the Lower Bearing of 
Connecting Rod to ANSYS 
 
After this areas and sections are segmented as 
importing the model to ANSYS results in some 
imperfection. Thus the geometry clean-up is done. 
Now the material properties are defined on the 
model for the material used as shown in table above. 
After that, the meshing of model is to be done. Here 
a model is divided into a number of elements and 
nodes. The meshed models of the connecting rod 
are as shown in figure 7 & 8 below, 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Meshed model of connecting rod on 
ANSYS 
 
 
Figure 8: Meshed Model of the Lower Bearing of 
Connecting Rod in ANSYS 
 
Once meshing is done the boundary conditions i.e... 
DOF constrains, forces, loads are to be applied on 
the model. As shown fig 9, the pressure is applied 
on the Crank end bearing of the connecting rod, 
while keeping piston end fixed. The pressure of 15 
& 30 Mpa is used.

Now the Lower half Crank end bearing is taken and 
boundary constrained and loads are applied on it. 
As shown in fig 10, the pressure is applied on the 
bearing face of the model, while keeping bolt area 
fixed. The pressure of 15 & 30Mpa is used.

RESULTS OUTPUT OF ANALYSIS: 
The static analysis of connecting rod models was 
conducted for different materials to identify the 
fatigue locations on it. The tern ‚Äústatic‚Äù implies that 
the forces do not change with time. Results of the 
static analysis output are shown via stress, strain 
and deformation under the applied load. The output 
results of static analysis of both the components are 
shown in fig below;

Graph 3: Strain Intensity Output data for Crank End Bearing 
Lower half and Connecting Rod 
 
X. CONCLUSIONS 
The forces were applied on the piston head and the 
effect of it on the connecting rod was studied in this 
analysis. The pressure developed in the big 
end/crank end of the connecting rod is analysed in 
two different parts i.e... Crank end Bearing Lower 
half and connecting rod for displacement, von-
misses stress and strain intensity output. The results 
or conclusion thus that can made on the bases of the 
output results by ANSYS can be as followed: 
‚Ä¢ It is observed that displacement, Stress and 
Strain Intensity induced in the Connecting 
Rod 
made 
up 
of 
Carbon 
fiber 
is 
comparatively slightly greater than as 
compare to the Connecting Rod made up of 
Stainless Steel, thus more advancement in 
the field of Carbon Fiber is required to be as 
equivalent and efficiently used as Stainless 
Steel. 
‚Ä¢ Also it was observed that Connecting Rod 
made up of Aluminium Alloy has higher 
intensity of Stress and Strain induced as 
compare to Connecting Rod made up of 
Carbon Fiber, thus Carbon Fiber can be a 
good replacement of Aluminium Alloy.  
‚Ä¢ It was observed that Von-misses Stress 
Intensity in the both the component Crank 
end Bearing Lower Half and the Connecting 
Rod for carbon fiber is lesser as compare to 
the that of Stainless Steel and Aluminium 
Alloy. Also manufacturing of complex 
shape and curved surfaces from Carbon 
Fiber is much easier and convenient than 
that of other materials used here. 
‚Ä¢ Though the intensity of displacement in 
Carbon fiber is much greater than that of 
Stainless Steel, but this can in minimize by 
adding more layers of carbon fiber during 
manufacturing process as it will increase the 
overall strength of component that too at 
much lesser increase in overall weight. 
‚Ä¢ It can observed from the displacement, Von-
misses stress and Strain Intensity Output 
obtained that the hot spot or the areas where 
the stresses and strain intensity in higher can 
be minimize by adding material i.e.‚Ä¶ 
increasing the thickness of that area and also 
the areas where the stress and strain 
intensity in less, the materials can be 
removed from that spot or area in order to 
decrease the weight of the component.  
‚Ä¢ The composite material like carbon fiber has 
good strength and also being lighter than 
both Stainless steel and Aluminium Alloy 
7075 can be used for connecting rod with 
the more easily in the near future. 
‚Ä¢ Also lighter weight of connecting rod (made 
up of High Strength Carbon fiber) can also 
help in reducing weight of engine block of 
the 
automobile, 
thus 
increasing 
fuel 
economy and thus also decreasing the 
emission from the automobile. 
‚Ä¢ Thought the stresses and strain intensity 
induced in the Connecting Rod made up 
Carbon Fiber is more than that induced in 
the 
Stainless 
Steel, 
but 
with 
the 
advancement in technology in the field of 
carbon fiber more higher Strength Carbon 
Fiber will be there in the near future for 
automobile industry. 
‚Ä¢ Thought the cost factor and time factor in 
the manufacturing of components by Carbon

Fiber in more at present time as compare to 
manufacturing by Stainless Steel and 
Aluminium Alloy, but mass production will 
greatly reduce the cost incurred and also 
time occurred will also reduce with the 
advancement in technology. 
Hence at last in can be concluded that Carbon 
Fiber are the future material that can be used for the 
manufacturing of Connecting Rod, for being lighter 
and comparable strength with that of Stainless Steel 
and Aluminium Alloy.
