I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Crankshaft is an important part of in an engine assembly. 
Crankshaft consists of two web sections and one 
crankpin. Crankshaft converts the reciprocating motion 
of the piston to a rotary motion with a four bar link 
mechanism. This paper is related to design and finite 
element analysis of crankshaft of 4 cylinder diesel 
engine of heavy vehicle like truck. Engine has capacity 
of 3785.1cc. The finite element analysis in ANSYS 
software by using five materials based on their 
composition viz. FG260, FG300, EN8, EN24 and 
Aluminum Alloy material. The parameter like von 
misses stress, deformation; maximum principal stress 
were obtained from analysis software.  The results of 
Finite element indicate that the Aluminum alloy 
material can be best suitable material among all.  
 
II. LITELATURE REVIEW 
 
Wei Li, Qing Yan, and Jianhua Xue [1] this paper 
analyzed through the chemical composition, mechanical 
properties, macroscopic feature, microscopic structure 
and theoretical calculation methods. The analysis results 
show that the crankshaft which has obvious fatigue 
crack belongs to fatigue fracture. The crankshaft fatigue 
fracture was only attributed to the initiation and 
propagation of the fatigue cracks on the lubrication hole 
under cyclic bending and torsion.

The fatigue strength and its correct assessment play an 
important role in design and maintenance of marine 
crankshafts to obtain operational safety and reliability. 
Crankshafts are under alternating bending on crankpins 
and rotating bending combined with torsion on main 
journals, which mostly are responsible for fatigue 
failure. 
The 
commercial 
management 
success 
substantially depends on the main engine in service and 
of its design crankshaft, in particular. The crankshaft 
design strictly follows the rules of classification 
societies. The present study provides an overview on the 
assessment of fatigue life of marine engine crankshafts 
and its maintenance taking into account the design 
improving in the last decades, considering that accurate 
estimation of fatigue life is very important to ensure 
safety of components and its reliability. An example of 
a semi-built crankshaft failure is also presented and the 
probable root case of damage, and at the end some final 
remarks are presented. 
 
M. Fonte, V. Anes, P. Duarte, L. Reis, and M. Freitas 
[3] this paper reports a failure mode analysis of a boxer 
diesel engine crankshaft. Crankshafts are components 
which experiment severe and complex dynamic 
loadings due to rotating bending combined with torsion 
on main journals and alternating bending on crankpins. 
High level stresses appear on critical areas like web

fillets, as well as the effect of centrifugal forces and 
vibrations. Since the fatigue fracture near the crankpin-
web fillet regions is one of the primary failure 
mechanisms of automotive crankshafts, designers and 
researchers have done the best for improving its fatigue 
strength. 
The 
present 
failure 
has 
occurred 
at 
approximately 2000 manufactured engines, and after 
about 95,000 km in service. The aim of this work is to 
investigate the damage root cause and understand the 
mechanism which led to the catastrophic failure. 
Recommendations for improving the engine design are 
also presented. 
 
M. Fonte, P. Duarte, L. Reis, M. Freitas, V. Infante [4] 
in this paper investigation is carried on two damaged 
crankshafts of single cylinder diesel engines used in 
agricultural services for several purposes. Recurrent 
damages of these crankshafts type have happened after 
approximately 100 h in service. The root cause never 
was imputed to the manufacturer. The fatigue design 
and an accurate prediction of fatigue life are of 
primordial importance to insure the safety of these 
components and its reliability. This study firstly 
presents a short review on fatigue power shafts for 
supporting the failure mode analysis, which can lead to 
determine the root cause of failure. The material of 
these damaged crankshafts has the same chemical 
composition to others found where the same type of 
fracture occurred at least ten years ago. A finite element 
analysis was also carried out in order to find the critical 
zones where high stress concentrations are present. 
Results showed a clear failure by fatigue under low 
stress and high cyclic fatigue on crankpins. 
B. Kareem [5] in this study, mechanical crankshaft 
failures for automobiles are evaluated based on experts’ 
opinion. This was done using data obtained using 
techniques based on oral interviews and questionnaire 
administration on mechanical failure of crankshafts 
from the experts working in the areas of automobile 
maintenance and crankshafts reconditioning. The data 
collected were analyzed using statistical methods based 
on probability. With this technique, probability of 
failure for each category of automobiles namely private, 
commercial cars and buses were evaluated. The results 
obtained show that private cars had lowest failure rate at 
the initial stage while commercial buses had the highest 
failure rate. At later periods all categories of automobile 
crankshafts considered had their failure rates converged 
steadily with stable reliability. Application of 6-sigma 
continuous improvement tool to the process indicated a 
further reliability improvement through improved oil 
lubrication system, especially in the thrust bearing. This 
showed that increased enlightenment campaign among 
the various stakeholders in automobile industries will 
improve on the choice of reliable mechanical 
crankshafts.

Crankshaft fatigue problem has long been a headache 
and frequent phenomenon in combustion engine which 
attracts various efforts especially including fundamental 
fatigue experimental data. In this paper, the rational 
experimental method is employed to study the 
crankshaft fatigue phenomenon based on a customized 
experiment 
platform, 
mimicking 
the 
real-world 
crankshaft working condition physically. Then, based 
on the experiment data, the statistical regression 
analysis 
of 
eight 
commonly 
used 
hypothesis 
distributions is conducted. The degrees of fitting effects 
of 
the 
chosen 
statistical 
model 
are 
evaluated 
individually. Results show that the three-parameter 
Weibull distribution model fits the data best which may 
be used as the fundamental model in future analysis. 
This study provides a solid foundation for better 
understanding the mechanism of crankshaft fatigue 
phenomenon. 
 
A. Ktari, N. Haddar, H.F. Ayedi [7] a failure 
investigation has been conducted on three cases of 
failed diesel engine crankshafts used in train and made 
up of forged carbon steel. The chemical composition 
and the mechanical properties of the crankshafts 
material including tensile properties, micro-hardness 
and toughness were evaluated. The crankshafts 
examination shows that all failures occurred after a 
fatigue process. The failure zones comprise the 
fractured surfaces observation, show the presence of 
beach marks with semi-elliptical shape surrounding the 
fracture origins indicate its progressive growth 
character. The cracks initiation can occur as a result of 
mechanical and thermal fatigue loads, due to the high 
stress concentration on fillet radius and the unusual 
friction between journals and bearings, respectively. 
Nevertheless, the cracks propagation was only attributed 
to the mechanical fatigue produced under cyclic 
bending and torsion loadings.

For the theoretical calculation of crankshaft we will 
consider the configuration of heavy vehicle like truck 4-
cylinder diesel engine to calculate the theoretical static 
result:

When the crank has turned through 35o from the top 
dead center, the pressure on the piston is 1 N/m m2 and 
the torque on the crank is maximum. The ratio of the 
connecting road length to the crank radius is 4. 
Assuming suitable data wherever is required. We will 
design the crankshaft for two position of the crank. 
 
B) Design of Crankshaft When the Crank is at TDC 
Maximum Bending Moment Occurs 
 
At this position of the crank, the maximum gas pressure 
on the piston will transmit maximum force on the 
crankpin in the plane of the crank causing only bending 
of the shaft. The crankpin as well as ends of the 
crankshaft will be only subjected to bending moment. 
Thus, when the crank is at the top dead center, the 
bending moment on the shaft is maximum and the 
twisting moment is zero.  
Let, D = Piston diameter or cylinder bore in mm,  
p = Maximum intensity of pressure on the piston in 
N/mm2  
The thrust in the connecting rod will be equal to the gas 
load on the piston (Fp). 
We know that piston gas load,
