1. INTRODUCTION  
The drive of the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) piston is to transfer from gas force in the 
cylinder to the crankshaft via connecting rod.  A piston is a critical part of an ICE. Due to the 
piston endures the cyclic gas pressure, inertia force may cause the fatigue damage of piston, 
wear, head cracks etc. By the chemical reaction of burning the gas creates the high temperature 
which makes the piston expand which creates thermal stress and thermal deformation. The 
thermal deformation and mechanical deformation causes piston cracks, tortuosity etc. Hence it 
is very essential to analyze the temperature distribution, stress distribution, thermal load, 
mechanical load and heat transfer in order to minimize the stress, and different loads on working 
condition of the piston. Most of the internal combustion engine piston is made of Al alloy which 
have thermal coefficient is 80% higher than the cylinder bore material made of cast iron.  
This author focuses to optimize the design by finding weight and stiffness for various 
materialistic mass and volume of the con rod. This paper will conclude whether the existing 
and modified design and it is clear that the stress and strain obtained by the modified design is 
less when compared to the existing design [1].  
This paper studied the thermal and the stress distribution of the piston which is initialized 
with four materials (Pure Aluminium, A6061, Al – GHS 1300 and Al-Sic-Graphite) by using 
by finite element method. The specification used for the specification belongs to four stroke 
single cylinder Hero-Honda motor cycle. The results predicted the maximum stress and the 
dangerous region on the different aluminum alloys piston using FEA [2]. 
Analysis of the thermal and mechanical stress distribution in the many parts of the piston to 
know the stresses due to the gas pressure and thermal variations using with Ansys. The engine 
piston is designed by using CATIA V5R16 and analysis was done form graphics software 
ANSYS 11.0. The volume of the piston is reduced by 24%, the thickness of barrel is reduced 
by 31%, width of other ring lands of the piston is reduced by 25%, von-misses stress is increased 
by 16% and deflection is increased after optimization. But all the parameters are well with in 
design consideration [3].  
In this study work there are two steps of study of the piston are Designing and Analysis. 
Firstly design the model of the piston based on the design specification using modeling software 
like INVENTOR. Import the model of the piston into the analysis software ANSYS in IGES 
format. Then the analysis has been carried out on the various parameters such as stress, 
deformation and temperature. In this work focused on the optimized piston through the mass 
and volume become reduced. The deformation also increased after the optimization which is 
responsible for the stress distribution on the piston head or piston crown [4]. 
This paper describes the stress distribution of the piston four stroke engines by using FEM. 
The main objective of the author is to investigate and analyze the thermal stress and maximum 
or minimum principal stresses. The stress concentration on the piston head, piston skirt and 
sleeve are reduced by optimization with using Pro-E/ CREO software the structural model of a 
piston will be developed.  Finite Element Analysis technique (FEA) to forecast the higher stress 
and critical region on that component [5]. 
In this work the analysis of the piston consists of mainly design and analysis. Design the 
model of the piston like PRO-E. The constrains which are act on the working condition of the

piston after the model of piston into the analysis software ANSYS in IGES format. The three 
different materials like Al alloy 4032, AISI 4340 Alloy Steel & Titanium Ti-6A1-4V were used 
for the finite element analysis. The performance analysis is carried out on various parameters 
such as stress, total deformation and temperature distribution. After the analysis of the three 
different materials, Al alloy is suitable for internal combustion engine [6]. 
There are lots of research works proposing, for engine pistons, new geometries, materials 
and manufacturing techniques, and this evolution has undergone with a continuous 
improvement over the last decades and required thorough examination of the smallest details.  
Anyhow all these studies, there are a huge number of damaged pistons. Damage mechanisms 
have different origins are mainly wear, high temperature distribution, and fatigue load.  
Current years CAE packages could acquire the stress contours of any ideal component or 
product. By the advancement of computational power, to obtain optimized design with the help 
of topology optimization. This paper deals the selection materials based on the finite element 
analysis and parametric optimization of a piston for a single cylinder four stroke spark ignition 
engine. In order to obtain the result of incorporating additive manufacturing of any shape 
regardless of its complexity by reducing significant percentage mass of initial design domain. 
The initial design considers thermal loads later it is verified for the performance under structural 
loading. The objective of this paper focuses the light weight piston design through reverse 
engineering techniques, selection of materials and parametric optimization in order to improve 
the performance and emission characteristics, bear the strength to weight ratio and reduces the 
total cost of production. 
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
2.1. Engine specification 
This paper attention is on piston; the geometry and the requirements of the piston solely depend 
upon the engine. The specification of the engine is used for the following Table 1.

2.2. Piston: Material 
Compact weight and high structural rigidity is the key factors essential for all components of 
an IC engine. For this purpose, the industries widely use aluminum alloys. Aluminum has a 
density of only 2.7 g/cm3, approximately one-third as much as steel (7.83 g/cm3). Aluminum 
die casting alloys are light weight, has good cast ability, good mechanical properties, offer good 
corrosion resistance and dimensional stability [7]. The application of aluminum matrix material 
is used in the automotive industry, aircraft industry, in construction of machines, as pressure 
vessels for cryogenic applications etc. 
The present paper is to study the possibility of enhanced grain refinement of an aluminium 
cast metal by making the use of fragmented Al3Ti and TiB2 particles in an Al_5Ti_B master

alloy. Various sizes of particles were provided by heat treatments and plastic deformation on a 
commercially-available Al_5Ti_B wire [8].  
In this study, the investigation of the temperature distribution between sample and die was 
done during the Spark Plasma Sintering synthesis of TiB2. The reaction among titanium and 
boron is exothermic for the binary phases—titanium monoboride (TiB) and TiB2. Because of 
this, the reactions can be easily observed by temperature changes inside a sample [9]. 
 
Addition of Ti-B grain refiner in Al-ADC12/nanoSiC composite results in enhancement of 
tensile strength, hardness, and wear resistance through grain refinement. In this research, 
composite of Al-ADC12/nanoSiC (0.15%vf) with variations of TiB respectively (0.0), (0.02), 
(0.04), (0.06), dan (0.08) wt% were produced by stir casting. The increase in mechanical 
properties of composites mainly because of Al3Ti acts as nucleants which initiates the grain 
refinement and the existence of MgAl2O4 phase indicates an interphase between nanoSiC and 
ADC12 matrix. However, the increase of Ti-B addition after optimum number gives no 
significant results. High composition of iron and magnesium addition will form intermetallic 
phase β-Fe, π-Fe, and Mg2Si [10]. 
The addition of a titanium boron aluminum grain refiner improves homogeneity and allows 
for a uniform distribution of alloying elements, reduces porosity, eliminates hot tearing in cast 
structures, improves responsiveness to subsequent heat treatment, and enhances mechanical 
properties and machinability in the fabrication process [11].  
The chemical composition test was conducted using a vacuum optical emission 
spectrometer in order to obtain the material DCA1 and also mechanical test were conducted. 
This author stated that the microstructure and mechanical properties of die cast aluminum A380 
alloy casts produced under varying pressure was investigated experimentally. The hardness of 
the die cast A380 samples that solidified under different applied pressures varied from 76 to 85 
HRN and likewise tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of the samples displayed an 
increase with increased pressure. Based on the chemical composition test and mechanical test 
of existing piston and DCA3reference material, DCA2 is fabricated which is Al-Si based alloy 
as per the ASTM B179-09. The chemical composition of material is tabulated in Table 2 and 
the properties of materials are summarized in table 3. The geometrical values of existing piston 
as shown in Table 4.

2.3. Reverse Engineering 
Reverse engineering is the process of obtaining a geometric CAD model from measurements 
obtained by using non-contact scanning technique of an existing physical model [13]. 
Many research articles on CAD/CAM are about generating computer models and moving 
into physical products. Sometimes, however, industries concerns have physical model to CAD 
models. The reasons are CAD model may not exist. Some industrialists requirement, models of 
production parts or subsystems to incorporate into a new product model. Present automobile 
engines and transmissions, for example, are regularly reused in new models with only slight 
modifications. This paper describes, it consists of following steps: Data acquisition, 
preprocessing, triangulation, feature extraction, segmentation and, surface fitting and the 
application of CAD/CAM/CAE tools [14].  
They are commonly used in automotive, air craft, marine, in medical life science and 
software industries etc.  
This paper used reverse engineering techniques, accurate measurements of the steinbichler 
comet L3D scanner has resolution of 2Mpx and 1600 x 1200 pixels, in order to obtain of an 
existing physical model.

3. PARAMETRIC OPTIMIZATION 
Modern engines with variable valve train or different direct injection concepts require pistons 
with complex crown shapes which would often lead to a higher piston weight. Therefore in

every new piston development, the piston geometry is optimized in particular in the ring 
belt/piston skirt area. Intensive application of numerical simulation methods enables significant 
weight reductions while increasing at the same time the load-bearing capacity. Newly 
developed alloys with better cast ability, but also higher fatigue resistance in the critical 
temperature and stress region, allow the realization of thinner wall structures. Improved casting 
methods enable large recesses for the ring belt and hence a considerable reduction in the piston 
weight. But also the use of steel pistons in i. c engines is discussed again and again. The 
advantages of steel pistons such as reduced installation clearances, low fuel consumption 
figures and long service life would have to be evaluated against customer demands such as low 
emission levels, lightweight, efficient cooling and a competitive price. But up to now, there are 
no definite indications that steel pistons would be a viable concept for mass production. The 
piston model was modified using the results obtained from parametric optimization. In figure 
8. (a) Shows the piston model imported to ANSYS and (b), fine meshed piston consists of 
100903 nodes and 62756 triangular elements. Figure 9. (a) shows the temperature distribution 
from top surface of the piston to the bottom of piston to attain a maximum temperature of 3000C 
and, the heat transferred per unit area in the piston to reach maximum is 2.0006 W/mm2 near 
the piston ring and minimum is at bottom of piston and (b) shows the maximum von-mises 
stress of 78.757Mpa. Figure 10. (a) Describes the total deformation of maximum 45.091mm

5. CONCLUSION 
It is observed that by conducting the coupled steady-state thermal structural analysis shows von 
misses stresses, deformation and factor of safety for the given loading conditions. After carrying 
out the coupled steady-state thermal structural analysis the stresses in loading conditions were 
studied and then area where excess material can be removed were decided. Parametric 
optimization was performed to reduce weight of the piston subjected to compressive load and 
tensile load. The Bottom piston skirt region of the piston offered the greatest potential for 
weight reduction. Based on the analysis result, it is possible to reduce the weight of the piston 
material in two ways such as one is selection of piston materials A360 is obtained 155.41 grams 
which is 8.12 % less compared to ADC12 and the other is mass of the optimized piston is 151.39 
grams and the optimized geometry is 7.42 % lighter than the existing piston without 
compromising the strength and stiffness.
