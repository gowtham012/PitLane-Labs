{"task": "Design a crankshaft", "response": "1. Start by referring to the paper \"Crankshaft Concept Design Flowchart for Product Optimization\" by R.G. Dubensky for a comprehensive understanding of the design process.\n\n2. Select the material for the crankshaft components. According to the given data, use Plain Carbon Steel for the Crank Web, Crank Pin, and Shaft.\n\n3. Use the given design data for each component: \u03c3c = 70 MPa for Crank Web, Crank Pin, and Shaft. Additionally, for the Shaft, use \u03c4 = 45 MPa.\n\n4. Use the assumed data provided: \u03b8 = 25\u25e6, L/r = 4, p\u2032 = 6 MPa, W = 1 kN, lc/dc = 1, P1 + P2 = 2 kN, b1 = b2, c1 = c2, c = 300 mm, pb = 10 MPa, l2/ds1 = 1, b = 2D.\n\n5. Use the given data for the design: D=400mm, L=600mm or R=300mm, pmean=0.5MPa, pmax=2.5MPa, W=50(10)3 N, T1+T2=6.5(10)3 N, \u03b8=350, p35=1MPa, (l/R)=5.\n\n6. Design the crankshaft for two positions: a) Crank is at dead center; b) Angle of maximum twist.\n\n7. For the design of the crankshaft when the crank is at the dead center, refer to the diagram provided and use the given parameters: R3, RV3(W), a, b, 1, x, 2, y, 3, F, T1+T2, W.\n\n8. Ensure to validate your design through simulation and testing to ensure it meets the required performance and safety standards. \n\n9. Document your design process, decisions, and final design for future reference and possible improvements. \n\n10. Finally, prepare a presentation of your design to share with your team and stakeholders for feedback and approval.", "expected": "\u00d835mm main journal, etc."}{"task": "Fault detection procedure for ABS light", "response": "1. Start the vehicle and observe the ABS light on the dashboard. It should illuminate briefly and then go off. If it stays on, there is a problem with the ABS system that needs to be addressed.\n\n2. Locate the safety module under the facia panel on the driver\u2019s side. It is colored purple. This module is responsible for shutting off the power supply to the fuel pump should the engine stall or the vehicle be involved in an accident. \n\n3. Check the safety module for any signs of damage or malfunction. It senses ignition pulses and cuts the fuel supply if the ignition pulses stop. If the ABS light is on and the engine is stalling or the vehicle has been in an accident, the safety module may be the cause.\n\n4. Test the ABS material provided by the Engineering workshop. ABS is a brittle material, but it is the only usable material for certain parts of the vehicle. Check the properties of the ABS as shown in table 24.\n\n5. Use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to reduce pressure loss in the intake system. ABS has a rough surface which can contribute to pressure loss. If the ABS light is on and there is a significant pressure loss in the intake system, the ABS material may be the cause.\n\n6. If the ABS light is still on after checking the safety module and the ABS material, consult with a senior engineer or a specialist. The problem may be more complex and require advanced diagnostic tools or techniques.", "expected": null}
